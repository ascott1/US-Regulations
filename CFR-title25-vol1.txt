                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (a) Persons filing documents in an appeal must serve copies of those

Secretary--Indian Affairs. The notice of appeal sent to the Interior 
Board of Indian Appeals shall certify that a copy has been sent to the 
Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs.
    (c) If the appellant is an Indian or Indian tribe not represented by 
counsel, the official with whom the appeal is filed (i.e., official

this section, personally or by mail serve a copy of all appeal documents 
on the official who will decide the appeal and on each interested party 
known to the official making such service.
    (d) Service of any document under this part shall be by personal

Service on a tribe shall be to the principal or designated tribal 
official or to the governing body.
    (e) In all cases where a party is represented by an attorney in an 
appeal, service of any document on the attorney is service on the party 
represented. Where a party is represented by more than one attorney, 
service on any one attorney is sufficient. The certificate of service on 
an attorney shall include the name of the party whom the attorney 
represents and indicate that service was made on the attorney 
representing that party.
    (f) When an official deciding an appeal determines that there has 
not been service of a document affecting a person's interest, the 
official shall either serve the document on the person or direct the 
appropriate legal counsel to serve the document on the person and allow 
the person an opportunity to respond.

[54 FR 6480, Feb. 10, 1989; 54 FR 7666, Feb. 22, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 2.13  Filing documents.

    (b) Bureau of Indian Affairs offices receiving a misdirected appeal 
document shall forward the document to the proper office promptly. If a 
person delivers an appeal document to the wrong office or mails an 
appeal document to an incorrect address, no extension of time should be 
allowed because of the time necessary for a Bureau office to redirect 
the document to the correct address.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an official 
deciding an appeal shall allow late filing of a misdirected document, 
including a notice of appeal, where the official finds that the

an appeal shall, when he/she files the document, also indicate his/her 
address. Thereafter, any change of address shall be promptly reported to

PART 10--INDIAN COUNTRY DETENTION FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
10.1  Why are policies and standards needed for Indian country detention 
          programs?
10.2  Who is responsible for developing and maintaining the policies and 
          standards for detention and holding facilities in Indian 
          country?

10.4  What happens if the policies and standards are not followed?
10.5   Where can I find the policies and standards for the 
          administration, operation, services, and physical plant/
          construction of Indian country detention, community 
          residential, and holding facilities?
10.6  How is the BIA assured that the policies and standards are being 
          applied uniformly and facilities are properly accredited?
10.7  Where do I find help or receive technical assistance in complying 
          with the policies and standards?
10.8  What minimum records must be kept and reports made at each 
          detention, community residential, or holding facility in 
          Indian country?
10.9  If a person is detained or incarcerated in an Indian country

          representative, get the BIA policies and standards?

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 25 U.S.C. 2, 9, 13, 2417, 2453, and 2802.

    Source: 61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 10.1   Why are policies and standards needed for Indian country detention programs?

    Policies and standards are required to ensure that all Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA) and tribal entities that receive Federal funding 
for the operation, maintenance, design and construction or renovation of 
detention facilities, community residential, or holding facilities are 
supporting constitutional rights and are complying with the Indian Law 
Enforcement Reform Act of 1990. Self-governance tribes and tribes with 
limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this 
part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. The provision for funding 
tribes for detention programs under the Indian Alcohol and Substance 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Public Law 99-570, (25 U.S.C. 2453) 
requires standards and procedures for such facilities.

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 10.2   Who is responsible for developing and maintaining the policies and standards for detention and holding facilities in Indian country?

    The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services who reports to the 
Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs, BIA, establishes policies, 
procedures, and standards for the operations, design, planning, 
maintenance, renovation, and construction of detention programs in the 
BIA and by tribal contract under Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450.


<R05>
Sec. 10.3   Who must follow these policies and standards?

    You must follow these minimum policies, standards, and guides if you 
are part of the BIA or tribal detention or rehabilitation program 
receiving Federal funding. Self-governance tribes and tribes with 
limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this 
part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. Detention officers, guards, 
cooks and other staff conducting business in the facilities must meet 
minimum standards of law enforcement personnel as prescribed in 25 CFR 
part 12, subpart D, ``Qualifications and Training Requirements.'' Those 
tribal programs not receiving Federal funding under the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93-638, as 
amended) who wish to be accredited are encouraged to use the policies 
and standards in that part

[[Page 18]]

since they have been modified and approved for Indian country.


<R05>
Sec. 10.4   What happens if the policies and standards are not followed?

    The risk for human and civil rights violations due to lack of common 
standards will subject the operation and/or facility to unnecessary 
exposure to liability. Lack of employee standards, particularly for 
training and background checks, will increase the risk of misconduct and 
vicarious liability of the tribes and the Federal government through 
tort claims. Funding sources for detention programs may become scarce to 
nonexistent because of contract noncompliance. The tribes' opportunity 
to receive funding from potential resource sharing agreements with other 
law enforcement agencies may be damaged because the facility may have to 
be closed for cause due to violation of the life safety codes.


<R05>
Sec. 10.5   Where can I find the policies and standards for the administration, operation, services, and physical plant/construction of Indian country 
          detention, community residential, and holding facilities?

    The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, maintains 
a manual of policies and procedures called the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
Manual (BIAM). The Chapter 69 BIAM titled ``Indian Country Detention 
Facilities and Programs,'' contains the BIA's policies, procedures, and 
standards for detention and holding programs in Indian country. The 
standards for the programs within the BIAM are in handbook format for 
easy field reference and use. Copies of the Chapter 69 BIAM and 
handbooks may be obtained from the Director, Office of Law Enforcement 
Services.

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 10.6   How is the BIA assured that the policies and standards are being applied uniformly and facilities are properly accredited?

    The tribes and BIA programs will use a phased approach to meeting 
all non-mandatory detention standards and will document progress on 
uniform reporting. The BIA Office of Law Enforcement Services will 
conduct periodic operational evaluations for oversight.


<R05>
Sec. 10.7  Where do I find help or receive technical assistance in complying with the policies and standards?

    The BIA has a trained Detention Specialist on the staff of the 
Office of Law Enforcement Services, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who is 
available to conduct evaluations and provide technical assistance or 
guidance in all facets of Indian country detention programs.


<R05>
Sec. 10.8  What minimum records must be kept and reports made at each detention, community residential, or holding facility in Indian country?

    The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services, BIA, will develop 
all necessary requirements for maintaining records, reporting data, and 
archiving information. These requirements will be published in 69 BIAM, 
``Indian Country Detention Facilities and Programs.''

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 10.9  If a person is detained or incarcerated in an Indian country detention, community residential, or holding facility, how would they know what their 
          rights, privileges, safety, protection and expected behavior 
          would be?

    When an individual is incarcerated in an Indian country detention, 
community residential, or holding facility, he/she will be given, or in 
some cases notified of the availability of, an Inmate Handbook. This 
book of guidelines describes in detail the inmate's rights, privileges, 
protection and safety, cleanliness and sanitation, and general health 
and nutritional standards. The Inmate Handbook describes the emergency 
evacuation procedures, medical, counseling, rehabilitation services, 
visitation procedures, and other appropriate information. The Inmate 
Handbook is published by the Director, Office of Law Enforcement 
Services and maintained by the detention facility administrator at each 
facility location.

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]

[[Page 19]]


<R05>
Sec. 10.10  What happens if I believe my civil rights have been violated while incarcerated in an Indian country detention or holding facility?

    All allegations of civil rights violations must be reported 
immediately to the Internal Affairs Branch of the Office of Law 
Enforcement Services. This office will ensure that such allegations are 
immediately reported to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department 
of Justice through established procedures. The BIA Internal Affairs 
Branch may also investigate alleged violations and make recommendations 
for additional action as necessary. Detailed instructions on the 
procedure to report violations can be found in the Inmate Handbook.


<R05>
Sec. 10.11  How would someone detained or incarcerated, or their representative, get the BIA policies and standards?

    At each detention, community residential, or holding facility 
located in a tribal jurisdiction where federal funds are used for 
operations or maintenance programs, the BIA's policies, standards, and 
procedures will be made available upon request. The Inmate Handbook will 
be made available to all persons at the time they are incarcerated or 
detained in a facility. There may be times when this may be delayed due 
to the physical or mental condition of the person at time of 
incarceration. In these cases, the Inmate Handbook will be made 
available when the person is deemed receptive and cognizant by the 
detention officer in charge. All policies, standards, procedures, and 
guidelines are available at each facility to the public or by writing to 
the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services.

accused, or any other person.
    (d) The Court of Indian Offenses may revoke its release of the 
defendant and order him or her committed at any time where it determines

the Court of Indian Offenses.

commander of the Indian police force and will be held responsible for 
the general efficiency and conduct of the members thereof. It shall be 
the duty of the superintendent, or his duly qualified representative, to 
keep himself informed as to the efficiency of the Indian police in the 
discharge of their duties, to subject them to a regular inspection, to 
inform them as to their duties and keep a strict accounting of the 
equipment issued them in connection with their official duties. It shall 
be the duty of the superintendent to detail such Indian policemen as may 
be necessary to carry out the orders of the Court of Indian Offenses and 
to preserve order during the court sessions. The superintendent shall 
investigate all reports and charges of misconduct on the part of Indian 
policemen and shall exercise such proper disciplinary measures as may be 
consistent with existing regulations. No superintendent of any Indian 
reservation shall assign or detail any member of the Indian police force 
for duty as janitor or chauffeur or for any duty not connected with the 
administration of law and order.


<R05>
Sec. 12.101  Police commissioners.

    The superintendent of any Indian reservation may, with the approval 
of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, designate as police commissioner 
any qualified person. Wherever any special or deputy special officer is 
regularly employed in any Indian jurisdiction, he shall be police 
commissioner for that jurisdiction. Such police commissioner shall obey 
the orders of the superintendent of the reservation where employed and 
shall see that the orders of the Court of Indian Offenses are properly 
carried out. The police commissioner shall be responsible to the 
superintendent for the conduct and efficiency of the Indian police under

prisoners, the keeping of records of offenses and police activities, and 
with court orders and legal forms and the

[[Page 56]]

duties of the police in relation thereto, and other subjects of 
importance for efficient police duty. It shall further be the purpose of 
the classes to consider methods of preventing crime and of securing 
cooperation with Indian communities in establishing better social 
relations.


<R05>
Sec. 12.103  Minimum standards for police programs.

    The following minimum standards are required of all law enforcement 
programs that receive funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs:

enforcement personnel shall be plainly distinguishable from the uniforms 
of any non-enforcement personnel working on the reservation. Each

photograph of the officer.
    (c) A firearm may be discharged only when in the considered judgment 
of the officer there is imminent danger of loss of life or serious 
bodily injury to the officer or to another person. The weapon may be 
fired only for the purpose of rendering the person at whom it is fired 
incapable of continuing the activity prompting the officer to shoot. The 
firing of warning shots is prohibited. This policy does not apply to the 
use of firearms to participate in official marksmanship training or to 
kill a dangerous or seriously injured animal.
    (d) Except in firearms training, each time a firearm is used for law 
enforcement purposes a report shall be filed with the superior of the 
officer who used the weapon. Whenever use of a weapon results in serious 
injury or death of any person, the officer firing the weapon shall be 
placed on administrative leave, or be assigned to strictly 
administrative duties pending a thorough investigation of all 
circumstances surrounding the incident.
    (e) Each law enforcement officer must have attained a score of 70 
percent or better on an approved firearms qualification course within 
the previous six months to be qualified to carry a firearm. Whenever an 
officer's firearms qualification lapses, the officer shall return all 
weapons issued. The following courses are approved firearms 
qualification courses:
    (1) The National Rifle Association National Police Course.
    (2) The National Rifle Association 25-Yard Course.

inches nor less than 4 inches for uniformed personnel, and not less than 
2 inches for plainclothes personnel. Only standard load ammunition may 
be used. Bureau of Indian Affairs officers who carried a .357 Magnum 
revolver while performing law enforcement functions for the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs before July 17, 1972, may be authorized to carry a .357 
Magnum revolver. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs may grant a written 
waiver to permit Bureau of Indian Affairs officers to carry hand guns 
not authorized by this paragraph.
    (2) Each tribe shall specify the type of firearms, ammunition and 
auxiliary equipment to be used by the law enforcement officers of that 
tribe.
    (g)(1) Newly employed patrol officers shall successfully complete 
within their first year of service the approved Basic Police Training

<R04>
                           Subpart A--Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 13.1  Purpose.

    (a) The regulations of this part establish the procedures by which 
an Indian tribe that occupies a reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 
1903(10) over which a state asserts any jurisdiction pursuant to the 
provisions of the Act of August 15, 1953 (67 Stat. 588) Pub. L. 83-280, 
or pursuant to any other federal law (including any special federal law 
applicable only to a tribe or tribes in Oklahoma), may reassume 
jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings as authorized by the 
Indian Child Welfare Act, Pub. L. 95-608, 92 Stat. 3069, 25 U.S.C. 1918.
    (b) On some reservations there are disputes concerning whether 
certain federal statutes have subjected Indian child custody proceedings 
to state jurisdiction or whether any such jurisdiction conferred on a 
state is exclusive of tribal jurisdiction. Tribes located on those 
reservations may wish to exercise exclusive jurisdiction or other 
jurisdiction currently exercised by the

[[Page 60]]

state without the necessity of engaging in protracted litigation. The 
procedures in this part also permit such tribes to secure unquestioned 
exclusive, concurrent or partial jurisdiction over Indian child custody 
matters without relinquishing their claim that no Federal statute had 
ever deprived them of that jurisdiction.
    (c) Some tribes may wish to join together in a consortium to 
establish a single entity that will exercise jurisdiction over all their 
members located on the reservations of tribes participating in the 
consortium. These regulations also provide a procedure by which tribes 
may reassume jurisdiction through such a consortium.
    (d) These regulations also provide for limited reassumptions 
including jurisdiction restricted to cases transferred from state courts 
under 25 U.S.C. 1911(b) and jurisdiction over limited geographical 
areas.
    (e) Unless the petition for reassumption specifically states 
otherwise, where a tribe reassumes jurisdiction over the reservation it 
occupies, any land or community occupied by that tribe which 
subsequently acquires the status of reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 
1903(10) also becomes subject to tribal jurisdiction over Indian child 
custody matters.


<R05>
Sec. 13.2  Information collection.

    The information collection requirement contained in Sec. 13.11 has 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1076-0112. The information is 
being collected when federally recognized tribes request reassumption of 
jurisdiction over child custody proceedings. The information will be 
used to determine if reassumption of jurisdiction over Indian child 
custody proceedings is feasible. Response is required to obtain a 
benefit.

<R04>
                         Subpart B--Reassumption


<R05>
Sec. 13.11  Contents of reassumption petitions.

    (a) Each petition to reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody 
proceedings and the accompanying plan shall contain, where available,

to determine whether reassumption is feasible:
    (1) Full name, address and telephone number of the petitioning tribe 
or tribes.
    (2) A resolution by the tribal governing body supporting the 
petition and plan. If the territory involved is occupied by more than 
one tribe and jurisdiction is to be reassumed over all Indians residing 
in the territory, the governing body of each tribe involved must adopt 
such a resolution. A tribe that shares territory with another tribe or 
tribes may reassume jurisdiction only over its own members without 
obtaining the consent of the other tribe or tribes. Where a group of 
tribes form a consortium to reassume jurisdiction, the governing body of 
each participating tribe must submit a resolution.
    (3) The proposed date on which jurisdiction would be reassumed.
    (4) Estimated total number of members in the petitioning tribe or 
tribes, together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.
    (5) Current criteria for membership in the tribe or tribes.

governing document, if any, that authorizes the tribal governing body to 
exercise jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters.
    (8) Description of the tribal court as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(12) 
that has been or will be established to exercise jurisdiction over 
Indian child custody matters. The description shall include an 
organization chart and budget for the court. The source and amount of 
non-tribal funds that will be used to fund the court shall be 
identified. Funds that will become available only when the tribe 
reassumes jurisdiction may be included.
    (9) Copy of any tribal ordinances or tribal court rules establishing 
procedures or rules for the exercise of jurisdiction over child custody 
matters.

[[Page 61]]

    (10) Description of child and family support services that will be 
available to the tribe or tribes when jurisdiction reassumed. Such 
services include any resource to maintain family stability or provide 
support for an Indian child in the absence of a family--regardless of 
whether or not they are the type of services traditionally employed by 
social services agencies. The description shall include not only those 
resources of the tribe itself, but also any state or federal resources 
that will continue to be available after reassumption of jurisdiction.
    (11) Estimate of the number of child custody cases expected during a 
year together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.
    (12) Copy of any tribal agreements with states, other tribes or non-
Indian local governments relating to child custody matters.
    (b) If the petition is for jurisdiction other than transferral 
jurisdiction under 25 U.S.C. 1911(b), the following information shall 
also be included in the petition and plan:
    (1) Citation of the statute or statutes upon which the state has 
based its assertion of jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters.
    (2) Clear and definite description of the territory over which 
jurisdiction will be reassumed together with a statement of the size of 
the territory in square miles.
    (3) If a statute upon which the state bases its assertion of 
jurisdiction is a surplus land statute, a clear and definite description 
of the reservation boundaries that will be reestablished for purposes of 
the Indian Child Welfare Act.
    (4) Estimated total number of Indian children residing in the 
affected territory together with an explanation of how the number was 
estimated.


<R05>
Sec. 13.12  Criteria for approval of reassumption petitions.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs shall approve a tribal 
petition to reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters if:
    (1) Any reservation, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(10), presently 
affected by the petition is presently occupied by the petitioning tribe 
or tribes;
    (2) The constitution or other governing document, if any, of the 
petitioning tribe or tribes authorizes the tribal governing body or 
bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters;
    (3) The information and documents required by Sec. 13.11 of this 
part have been provided;
    (4) A tribal court, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(12), has been 
established or will be established before reassumption and that tribal 
court will be able to exercise jurisdiction over Indian child custody 
matters in a manner that meets the requirements of the Indian Civil 
Rights Act, 25 U.S.C. 1302;
    (5) Child care services sufficient to meet the needs of most 
children the tribal court finds must be removed from parental custody 
are available or will be available at the time of reassumption of 
jurisdiction; and
    (6) The tribe or tribes have established a procedure for clearly 
identifying persons who will be subject to the jurisdiction of the tribe 
or tribes upon reassumption of jurisdiction.
    (b) If the technical assistance provided by the Bureau to the tribe 
to correct any deficiency which the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs 
has identified as a basis for disapproving a petition for reassumption 
of exclusive jurisdiction has proved unsuccessful in eliminating 
entirely such problem, the Bureau, at the request of the tribe, shall 
assist the tribe to assert whatever partial jurisdiction as provided in 
25 U.S.C. 1918(b) that is feasible and desired by the tribe. In the 
alternative, the Bureau, if requested by the concerned tribe, shall 
assist the tribe to enter into agreements with a state or states 
regarding the care and custody of Indian children and jurisdiction over 
Indian child custody proceedings, including agreements which may provide 
for the orderly transfer of jurisdiction to the tribe on a case-by-case 
basis or agreements which provide for concurrent jurisdiction between 
the state and the Indian tribe.


<R05>
Sec. 13.13  Technical assistance prior to petitioning.

    (a) Upon the request of a tribe desiring to reassume jurisdiction 
over Indian child custody matters, Bureau

[[Page 62]]

agency and Area Offices shall provide technical assistance and make 
available any pertinent documents, records, maps or reports in the 
Bureau's possession to enable the tribe to meet the requirements for 
Secretarial approval of the petition.
    (b) Upon the request of such a tribe, to the extent funds are 
available, the Bureau may provide funding under the procedures 
established under 25 CFR 23.22 to assist the tribe in developing the 
tribal court and child care services that will be needed when 
jurisdiction is reassumed.


<R05>
Sec. 13.14  Secretarial review procedure.

    (a) Upon receipt of the petition, the Assistant Secretary--Indian 
Affairs shall cause to be published in the Federal Register a notice 
stating that the petition has been received and is under review and that 
it may be inspected and copied at the Bureau agency office that serves 
the petitioning tribe or tribes.
    (1) No final action shall be taken until 45 days after the petition 
has been received.
    (2) Notice that a petition has been disapproved shall be published 
in the Federal Register no later than 75 days after the petition has 
been received.
    (3) Notice that a petition has been approved shall be published on a 
date requested by the petitioning tribe or within 75 days after the 
petition has been received--whichever is later.
    (b) Notice of approval shall include a clear and definite 
description of the territory presently subject to the reassumption of 
jurisdiction and shall state the date on which the reassumption becomes 
effective. A copy of the notice shall immediately be sent to the 
petitioning tribe and to the attorney general, governor and highest 
court of the affected State or States.
    (c) Reasons for disapproval of a petition shall be sent immediately 
to the petitioning tribe or tribes.
    (d) When a petition has been disapproved a tribe or tribes may 
repetition after taking action to overcome the deficiencies of the first 
petition.


<R05>
Sec. 13.15  Administrative appeals.

    The decision of the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs may be 
appealed under procedures established in 43 CFR 4.350-4.369.\1\

Sec. 16.2  Scope of regulations.

    The regulations in this part set forth procedures for discharging 
the responsibilities of the Secretary in connection with the performance 
by State courts, as authorized by Federal statutes, of certain functions 
which affect properties in which a restricted interest is owned by an 
Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes. These State court functions pertain 
to such proceedings as guardianship, heirship determination, will 
probate, estate administration, conveyance approval, partition of real 
property, confirmation of title to real property, and appeal from action 
removing or failing to remove restrictions against alienation. In 
addition, the regulations in this part set forth procedures for 
discharging certain other responsibilities of the Secretary not 
necessarily involving State court functions, such as escheat of estates 
of deceased Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes.


<R05>
Sec. 16.3  Legal representation in State courts.

    The statutory duties of the Secretary to furnish legal advice to any 
Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes, and to represent such Indian in 
State courts, in matters affecting a restricted interest owned by such 
Indian, shall be performed by attorneys on the staff of the Solicitor, 
under the supervision of the Field Solicitor. Such advice and 
representation shall be undertaken to the extent that the Field 
Solicitor in his discretion shall consider necessary to discharge said 
duties, with due regard to the complexity of the legal action 
contemplated, the availability of staff attorneys for such purposes, the 
value and extent of the restricted interests involved, possible 
conflicts between Indians claiming to be owners of such interests, the 
preference of such owners concerning legal representation, the financial 
resources available to such owners, the extent to which such owners 
require similar legal services in connection with their unrestricted 
properties, and any other factor appropriate for consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 16.4  Exchange of information within the Department.

    To the extent that information may be useful in discharging the 
duties covered by the regulations in this part, the Bureau shall furnish

<R05>
Sec. 17.14  Appeals.

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions in part 2 of this chapter 
concerning appeals generally from administrative actions, any appeal 
from the action of the superintendent of approving or disapproving a

decision will be final.

[[Page 68]]

    (c) Upon the filing of notice with the superintendent of intention 
to appeal or the perfecting of an appeal by service upon the 
superintendent, at the same time similar notice and service shall be 
effected by the party taking an appeal upon opposing counsel or 
litigants, and a statement included in the appeal that this has been 
done. A party taking an appeal may, within the same 30-day period 
allowed for perfecting an appeal, file a brief or other written 
statement of his contentions, showing also service of that brief upon 
opposing counsel or litigants. Opposing counsel or litigants shall have 
30 days from the date of the service of appellant's brief upon them in 
which to file an answer brief, copies of which also shall be served upon 
the appellant or opposing counsel and litigants. Except by special 
permission, no other briefs will be allowed on appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 20.21  General assistance.

    In States where BIA general assistance would otherwise be available, 
the Bureau will not provide general assistance:
    (a) To on or near-reservation members of tribes currently not served 
by BIA general assistance unless the tribe formally requests, through 
final governing body action, that the Bureau operate a general 
assistance program. Such request for BIA general assistance should be 
timed with the Bureau's next fiscal year for the general assistance 
program;
    (b) In any State having a general assistance program available to 
meet the needs of eligible citizens, including the needs of Indians. A 
State general assistance program is available if payments are:
    (1) Available statewide to eligible individuals and families, 
including Indians on reservations;
    (2) Authorized by State law with funds regularly appropriated to 
make such payments, or if State law requires all county governments or 
localities to make such payments even though payments may fluctuate 
subject to the limited availability of funds;
    (3) For the purpose of meeting monthly minimum essential needs on a 
continuing basis; and,
    (4) Where the Bureau provides general assistance on a reservation in 
one State and that reservation extends into a bordering State(s), the 
Bureau will provide general assistance to members of the tribe in the 
other bordering State(s) based on the standard of assistance in the 
State where the recipient or applicant resides. However, the Bureau will 
provide such assistance in the bordering State(s) only to those members 
who are not eligible for State general assistance as defined in 
Sec. 20.21.
    (c) In States where the Bureau provides general assistance, Indians, 
in order to be considered eligible for general assistance under this 
part, must meet the requirements prescribed in Sec. 20.20(a); and the 
following conditions:
    (1) Must not receive financial assistance from AFDC or Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI);
    (i) Indians eligible to receive AFDC or SSI will be allowed to 
receive BIA general assistance once they have applied for and until they 
begin to receive assistance payments from AFDC or SSI, except that 
payment shall be authorized when good cause reasons, such as physical 
isolation, lack of transportation or intermittent availability of State 
eligibility specialists, temporarily prevent concurrent application; and 
when it can be documented that the application process has been 
initiated by scheduling an appointment, or that the BIA/tribal 
caseworker has initiated the application process on behalf of the 
general assistance applicant.
    (ii) The Bureau will not make payments for any month for which AFDC 
or SSI payments are made.
    (2) Must have insufficient resources to meet the basic and special 
need items defined by the Bureau standard of assistance;
    (3) Must apply for assistance from other Federal, State, county, or 
local programs for which they may be eligible concurrent with 
application to the Bureau for general assistance, unless good cause 
reasons, such as physical isolation with sporadic access to 
transportation or intermittent availability of State eligibility 
specialists, temporarily prevent concurrent application; and when it can 
be documented that the application process has been initiated by 
scheduling an appointment, or

[[Page 74]]

that the BIA/tribal caseworker has initiated the application process on 
behalf of the general assistance applicant.
    (d) Redeterminations. (1) The Bureau shall determine eligibility and 
the amount of the BIA general assistance payment based on its best 
estimate of income and circumstances which will exist in the month for 
which the Bureau is to provide assistance. Recipients are required to 
immediately inform the Bureau of any changes in status which may affect 
their eligibility or amount of assistance. The Bureau shall redetermine 
eligibility:
    (i) Whenever there is an indication of a change in circumstances;
    (ii) Not less frequently than every three (3) months for individuals 
who are not exempt under paragraph 20.21(i) from seeking or accepting 
employment;
    (iii) Not less frequently than one every six (6) months for all 
households.
    (2) The redetermination process shall include personal contact with 
the recipient, preferably a home visit, not less than once a year to 
evaluate changes in living circumstances and household composition, and 
to assess the need for continued assistance.
    (e) Standards of assistance. (1) Where the Bureau operates a general 
assistance program, its standard of assistance shall be the AFDC payment 
standard used in the State where the applicant or recipient resides. In 
a State that meets 100 percent of the need standard, the Bureau standard 
is the need standard. In a State that does not meet need in full and 
applies a rateable reduction to the need standard, the Bureau standard 
is the rateable reduced amount. The AFDC payment standard incorporates 
the same basic and special need items as the AFDC standard of 
assistance, and is the amount from which the Bureau will subtract net 
income and liquid assets to determine eligibility for and the amount of 
the Bureau's general assistance payment.
    (2) In the event the State has no standard for one adult, the Bureau 
standard for one adult shall be the difference between the standard for 
one child and the standard for a household of two which includes an 
adult, or one-half the amount of the standard for a household of two, 
whichever is greater.
    (f) Resources. In determining eligibility for and the amount of the 
general assistance payment, the Bureau shall consider all types of 
income and other liquid assets available for support and maintenance 
unless otherwise disregarded under Sec. 20.21(g), or specifically 
excluded by Federal statute. All earned or unearned income will be 
counted as income in the month received and as a liquid asset 
thereafter, except certain income from the sale of real personal 
property as provided for under Sec. 20.21(f)(2)(i). Resources are 
considered available both when actually available and when the applicant 
or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum, as defined at 25 
CFR 20.1(w), and has the ability to make such sum available for support 
and maintenance.
    (1) Earned income means in cash or in kind earned by an individual 
through the receipt of wages, salary, commissions, or profit from 
activities in which he is engaged as a self-employed individual or as an 
employee.
    (i) Earned income includes earnings over a period of time for which 
settlement is made at one given time, as in the instance of the sale of 
farm crops, livestock, etc.
    (ii) With respect to self-employment, earned income means total 
profit from business enterprise, i.e., gross receipts after subtracting 
business expenses directly related to producing the goods or services 
and without which the goods or services could not be produced. Business 
expenses do not include items such as depreciation, personal business 
and entertainment expenses, personal transportation, purchase of capital 
equipment and payments on the principal on loans for capital assets or 
durable goods.
    (2) Unearned income includes but is not limited to:
    (i) Income from: Interest; oil and gas and other mineral royalties; 
rental property; cash contributions such as child support and alimony; 
retirement, disability and unemployment benefits; per capita payments 
not excluded by Federal statute; sale of trust land and real or personal 
property which is not

[[Page 75]]

set aside for the purpose of reinvestment in trust land or a primary 
residence, or if set aside, has not been reinvested in trust land or a 
primary residence at the end of one year from the date the income was 
received; Federal and State tax refunds. All of the above shall be 
counted to the extent they are not disregarded by Federal statute.
    (ii) Income in kind contributions providing shelter at no cost to 
the individual or household: In establishing the amount of the in kind 
contribution, the Bureau shall use the amount for shelter included in 
the standard, if identifiable, or 25 percent of the standard unless 
there is evidence provided that the value of free shelter is less; and,
    (iii) Assistance provided by a State, county or local agency.
    (3) The Bureau shall prorate (i): Over a 12-month period recurring 
annual income received by individuals, such as teachers whose regular 
employment does not engage them on a year round basis; (ii) income 
received by individuals employed on a contractual basis over the period 
of the contract; and (iii) intermittent income received quarterly, 
semiannually or yearly over the period covered by the income. The Bureau 
shall prorate the income unless there is evidence that the income will 
not continue to be received in the future. However, for a period of 
three years from the publication date of these regulations, the Bureau 
will not prorate lease income which has been obligated by a household in 
a manner which makes it unavailable in consumable form to the household.
    (g) Disregards. (1) The Bureau shall disregard, from the gross 
amount of earned income, amounts deducted for:
    (i) Federal, State and local taxes;
    (ii) Social Security (FICA);
    (iii) Health insurance;
    (iv) Work related expenses, including reasonable transportation 
costs;
    (v) Child care costs except where the other parent in the home is 
not working or is not disabled; and
    (vi) The cost of special clothing, tools and equipment directly 
related to the individual's employment. All of the above, as 
appropriate, will be disregarded from self-employment income after 
deducting costs of doing business.
    (2) The Bureau shall disregard as income, or other liquid assets:
    (i) The first $1000 of liquid resources available to the household;
    (ii) Any home produce from garden, livestock and poultry utilized by 
the applicant or recipient and his/her household for their consumption;
    (iii) Resources specifically excluded by Federal statute.
    (h) Payments. (1) The Bureau shall make assistance payments in an 
amount not to exceed the difference between the Bureau standard of 
assistance and all resources not otherwise disregarded. In the event the 
State in which the individual or household lives applies a rateable 
reduction to that difference or maintains a system of dollar maximums on 
the payment, the Bureau shall also apply the rateable reduction and/or 
the maximum to the payment.
    (2) If there is more than one household living in a dwelling and the 
household(s) receiving general assistance contribute to shelter 
expenses, the Bureau shall prorate the actual shelter cost, but the 
amount in the payment for shelter will not exceed the amount in the 
Bureau standard of assistance for shelter, or if not identifiable, the 
prorated amount, in addition to other needs, cannot exceed the total 
amount in the standard for individuals or households in similar 
circumstances.
    (3) The Bureau will round the payment down to the next lower whole 
dollar.
    (4) In no case shall the Bureau provide retroactive payments of 
general assistance for any period prior to the date of application for 
assistance.
    (i) Employment. (1) An applicant or recipient must actively seek 
employment, including use of available tribally or Bureau-funded 
employment assistance services. The individual is also required to 
accept available local employment. An individual who does not comply 
will not be eligible for general assistance. These requirements do not 
apply to:
    (i) A person under the age of 16 years;
    (ii) A full-time student under the age of 19 who is attending an 
elementary or secondary school, or a vocational or technical school 
equivalent to a secondary school;

[[Page 76]]

    (iii) A person suffering from an illness, when it is determined on 
medical evidence or on other sound basis that the individual's illness 
or injury is serious enough to temporarily prevent entry into 
employment;
    (iv) An incapacitated person, when verified that a physical or 
mental impairment determined by a physician or licensed or certified 
psychologist, by itself or in conjunction with age, prevents the 
individual from engaging in employment;
    (v) A person who, upon the documented assessment of the social 
services caseworker, and pending examination by a physician or other 
appropriate professional, is deemed essentially incapacitated because of 
age, physical or mental impairment;
    (vi) An individual responsible for a person in the home who has a 
verified physical or mental impairment that requires the individual in 
the home on a virtually continuous basis, and there is no other 
appropriate household member available;
    (vii) A parent or other individual who personally provides full-time 
care of a child under that age of 6;
    (viii) A parent or minor living in the household if the other parent 
is not exempt from seeking or accepting employment;
    (ix) A person who is working 30 hours or more per week in 
unsubsidized employment expected to last a minimum of 30 days. This 
exemption continues to apply if there is a temporary break in full-time 
employment expected to last no longer than 10 work days; and
    (x) A person for whom employment is not accessible in a commuting 
time that is reasonable and comparable with others in similar 
circumstances.
    (2) Where the tribe administers a Tribal Work Experience Program 
(TWEP), the nonexempt individual shall be available to participate. 
However, participation does not relieve the individual from seeking or 
accepting employment.
    (3) Individuals not exempt under one of the preceding clauses of 
this section must, in seeking employment, provide evidence of efforts to 
obtain employment.
    (4) Individuals not exempt under one of the preceding clauses of 
this section, who refuse, or otherwise fail to seek and accept available 
local employment, or who voluntarily and without good cause do not 
maintain their employed status, will not be eligible to receive general 
assistance for a period of 60 days following the date of application, or 
eligibility redetermination.
    (i) The 60-day period of ineligibility will be renewed upon each 
application for general assistance until the applicant complies with the 
requirement to seek and accept available local employment.
    (ii) An unemployed individual against whom a 60-day eligibility 
suspension has been levied will have the suspension period reduced by 30 
days upon providing evidence that he/she has made effort to seek 
employment.
    (iii) Periods of eligibility suspension shall affect only the 
individual who fails to comply with the provision of this section, but 
shall not apply to other members of his/her household.

    (a) Grants awarded under this subpart are for the establishment and 
operation of tribally designed Indian child and family service programs. 
The objective of every Indian child and family service program shall be 
to prevent the breakup of Indian families and to ensure that the 
permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his or her 
Indian parent or Indian custodian shall be a last resort. Such child and 
family service programs may include, but need not be limited to:
    (1) A system for licensing or otherwise regulating Indian foster and 
adoptive homes, such as establishing tribal standards for approval of 
on-reservation foster or adoptive homes;
    (2) The operation and maintenance of facilities for counseling and 
treatment of Indian families and for the temporary custody of Indian 
children with the goal of strengthening Indian families and preventing 
parent-child separations;
    (3) Family assistance, including homemaker and home counselors, 
protective day care and afterschool care, recreational activities, 
respite care, and employment support services with the goal of 
strengthening Indian families and contributing to family stability;
    (4) Home improvement programs with the primary emphasis on 
preventing the removal of children due to unsafe home environments by 
making homes safer, but not to make extensive structural home 
improvements;
    (5) The employment of professional and other trained personnel to 
assist the tribal court in the disposition of domestic relations and 
child welfare matters, but not to establish tribal court systems;
    (6) Education and training of Indians, including tribal court judges 
and staff, in skills relating to child and family assistance and service 
programs;
    (7) A subsidy program under which Indian adoptive children not 
eligible for state or BIA subsidy programs may be provided support 
comparable to that for which they could be eligible as foster children, 
taking into account the appropriate state standards of support for 
maintenance and medical needs;
    (8) Guidance, legal representation and advice to Indian families 
involved in tribal, state, or Federal child custody proceedings; and
    (9) Other programs designed to meet the intent and purposes of the 
Act.
    (b) Grants may be provided to tribes in the preparation and 
implementation of child welfare codes within their jurisdiction or 
pursuant to a tribal-state agreement.
    (c) Grantees under this subpart may enhance their capabilities by 
utilizing ICWA funds as non-Federal matching shares in connection with 
funds provided under titles IV-B, IV-E and XX of the Social Security Act 
or other Federal programs which contribute to and promote the intent and 
purposes of the Act through the provision of comprehensive child and 
family services in coordination with other tribal, Federal, state, and 
local resources available for the same purpose.
    (d) Program income resulting from the operation of programs under 
this subpart, such as day care operations, may be retained and used for 
purposes similar to those for which the grant was awarded.

grant;
    (2) Violated the rights as specified in Sec. 23.49 or endangered the 
health, safety, or welfare of any person; or

grant, upon notice to the grantee, if the grants officer determines that 
continuance of the grant poses an immediate threat to safety. In this

hearing for the grantee within 10 days of the cancellation.
    (d) The hearing referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall

enrollment information relating to an adopted Indian child where the 
biological parents have by affidavit requested anonymity. In such cases, 
the chief tribal enrollment officer shall certify the child's tribe, 
and, where the information warrants, that the child's parentage and 
other circumstances entitle the child to enrollment consideration under 
the criteria established by the tribe.

individual situation shall be made available.
    (b) Services may be provided either with or without the expenditure 
of financial grants depending upon the type of service requested and the 
need for financial assistance. Funds shall not be provided to finance 
temporary employment except for the following:
    (1) High school students who are at least 17 years of age or college 
students participating in summer placement programs to gain work 
experience and temporary income may receive limited funding as needed to 
enable such persons to secure and hold summer jobs. This special service 
will not count against the number of services allowed under 
Sec. 26.5(e).
    (2) Persons who have moved to an off-reservation area for permanent 
employment, through services of the Employment Assistance program, may 
at times be required to accept temporary employment until permanent 
employment is available. Such persons may receive funds as needed within 
established limitations and justifiable circumstances, as allowed by the 
Area Director, until permanent employment is found and/or the need is 
met.

[[Page 103]]

    (c) Permanent employment shall normally be defined as employment 
which is generally anticipated to be of one year or more in duration. 
Employment in the construction or other trades where moving from one job 
to another is generally required of persons engaged in such occupations 
shall be considered as permanent employment.
    (d) In those cases where applicants apply and are selected for 
employment services in off-reservation urban locations, a variety of 
services may be provided, based upon individual client needs and 
requests for assistance. These may include advice in rental of housing, 
shopping, money management, community adjustment, counseling, applying 
for and seeking employment, and emergency financial assistance for up to 
six months from the date of entry into this program. Continuing non-
financial assistance, as needed, shall remain indefinitely available.
    (e) Assistance as needed may be provided to enable clients who move 
for employment to an off-reservation urban or non-urban area to accept a 
specific job offer. In such cases, however, transportation or financial 
assistance may be provided only after confirmation has been obtained 
from the employer, giving details of employment, including the 
following:
    (1) Job title,
    (2) Beginning wage,
    (3) Date to start work,
    (4) First payday,
    (5) First full payday, and
    (6) A statement that the job is anticipated to be of a permanent 
nature.


<R05>
Sec. 26.7  Financial assistance for program participants.

    (a) Individuals or families with a family member participating in 
the Employment Assistance program may be granted financial assistance, 
as needed, based upon rates established by the Area Director for the 
respective areas or jurisdictions within those areas.
    (b) Not more than thirty (30) percent of the funds appropriated for 
any program year may be used to pay for the costs of administration. 
Administrative costs include salaries and fringe benefits of direct 
program administrative positions such as program director or program 
officer, program/financial analyst, labor market analyst, clerical 
personnel, travel costs, materials, supplies, equipment, space and 
utilities. The remaining seventy (70) percent of funds available may be 
used for transportation and subsistence enroute to employment location; 
subsistence for one month or until the first paycheck from employment is 
received; emergency assistance is allowed where verified emergencies 
justify such grants and must have Area Director approval; and supportive 
services. Supportive services includes tools for employment, initial 
union dues, transportation of household effects, security and safety 
deposits, personal appearance and housewares, child care, and costs of 
employment counselors engaged in providing services to applicants 
(salaries, fringe benefits and travel costs).
    (c) Marital status of applicants is not a consideration for 
determining eligibility for services, but this factor is a consideration 
for determining appropriate subsistence grants. Proof of a legal 
relationship requiring support shall be required as a basis for 
application of family subsistence rates. In the case of married persons, 
proof of marriage shall be required to satisfy this requirement.
    (d) Financial assistance shall not be used to supplement the income 
of a person already employed.

Sec. 27.4  Filing applications.

    (a) Applications for adult vocational training services must be 
filed at Bureau of Indian Affairs agency offices, or at facilities under 
contract with the Bureau or contract offices located on or near

over the age of thirty-five (35) shall be eligible, assuming training 
and permanent employment to be otherwise feasible in terms of health and 
physical capability.
    (c) An applicant must be in need of training in order to obtain 
reasonable and satisfactory employment or is underemployed and without 
additional training would result in extreme hardship for the applicant,

be unemployed, underemployed, or unable to work in his/her primary 
occupation due to physical or other disabilities. Time spent in on-the-
job training programs will be deducted from the maximum of institutional 
training eligibility.
    (f) Only those applicants who willingly declare intent to accept 
full time employment as soon as possible after completion of training 
shall be selected. Plans may subsequently change, but the intent of the 
training program is preparation for employment, and this must be the 
initial intent of program participants. The program is not meant to 
serve as a preliminary to immediate further education.

training benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 27.7  Approval of courses for vocational training at institutions.

    (a) A course of vocational training at any institution, public or 
private, offering vocational training may be approved by the Assistance 
Secretary; provided:
    (1) The institution is accredited by a recognized national regional 
accrediting association; or
    (2) The institution is approved for training by a state agency 
authorized to make such approvals; and
    (3) It is determined that there is reasonable certainty of 
employment for graduates of the institution in their respective fields 
of training.
    (b) Cooperative education (a combination of classroom theory with 
related practical job experience) is considered as valuable learning 
experience and is specifically allowed and encouraged.

participation in this program;
    (b) Is under the supervision of a State apprenticeship agency, a 
State Apprenticeship Council, or the Federal Apprenticeship Training 
Services;
    (c) Leads to an occupation which requires the use of skills that

characteristics; and
    (d) Is identified expressly as apprenticeship training by the 
establishment offering it.


<R05>
Sec. 27.9  Approval of on-the-job training.

enterprise which

[[Page 107]]

provides an on-the-job training program offering definite potential for 
skilled permanent employment.
    (c) Yearly on-the-job training contractual agreements with a 
specific contractor shall not be renewed beyond the second year without 
review and written approval from the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs. 
Extension of contracts exceeding two years will be based upon a 
contractors demonstrated expansion of the enterprise, need for 
additional trainees, and placement of trainees completing the program.
    (d) Reimbursement to the on-the-job training contractor may include 
one-half of the hourly wage paid during the training period with the 
contractor paying the other half. The hourly rate must be at least the

granted financial assistance as needed, based upon rates established by 
the Area Director for the respective areas, or jurisdictions within 
those areas. Trainees may be assisted to secure educational grants from 
other sources for which they qualify. Such income shall be considered in 
computing amounts of financial assistance to be provided by the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs. Marital status of trainees is not a consideration for 
determining eligibility for training, but this factor is a consideration 
in determining appropriate subsistence grants. Proof of a legal 
relationship requiring support shall be required as a basis for 
application of family subsistence rates. In the case of married persons, 
proof of marriage shall be required to satisfy this requirement. 
Financial assistance may be provided for transportation and subsistence 
enroute to training; tuition and related training costs; subsistence 
while in training; emergency assistance is allowed where verified 
emergencies justify such grants and must have Area Director approval; 
and supportive services while in training. Supportive services includes

effects, security and safety deposits, personal appearance and 
housewares, child care, and cost of vocational training counselors 
engaged in providing services to trainees (salaries, fringe benefits and 
travel costs).
    (b) Not more than thirty (30) percent of the funds appropriated for 
any program year may be used to pay for the costs of administration. 
Administrative costs include salaries and fringe benefits of direct

personnel, travel costs, materials, supplies, equipment, space and 
utilities.

Sec. 32.3  Mission statement.

    Recognizing the special rights of Indian Tribes and Alaska Native 
entities and the unique government-to-government relationship of Indian 
Tribes and Alaska Native villages with the Federal Government as 
affirmed by the United States Constitution, U.S. Supreme Court 
decisions, treaties, Federal statutes, and Executive Orders, and as set 
out in the Congressional declaration in sections 2 and 3 of the Indian 
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638; 88 
Stat. 2203; 25 U.S.C. 450 and 450a), it is the responsibility and goal 
of the Federal

[[Page 111]]

government to provide comprehensive education programs and services for 
Indians and Alaska Natives. As acknowledged in section 5 of the Indian 
Child Welfare Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-608; 92 Stat. 3069; 25 U.S.C. 
1901), in the Federal Government's protection and preservation of Indian 
Tribes and Alaska Native villages and their resources, there is no 
resource more vital to such Tribes and villages than their young people 
and the Federal Government has a direct interest, as trustee, in 
protecting Indian and Alaska Native children, including their education. 
The mission of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Indian Education 
Programs, is to provide quality education opportunities from early 
childhood through life in accordance with the Tribes' needs for cultural 
and economic well-being in keeping with the wide diversity of Indian 
Tribes and Alaska Native villages as distinct cultural and governmental 
entities. The Bureau shall manifest consideration of the whole person, 
taking into account the spiritual, mental, physical and cultural aspects 
of the person within family and Tribal or Alaska Native village 
contexts.

    (s) Planning, maintenance and use of facilities. (1) Ensure that the 
needs of the students and Tribal or Alaska Native community will receive

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 36.1  Purpose, scope, and information collection requirements.

    (a) The purpose of this rule is to establish minimum academic 
standards for the basic education of Indian children for Bureau-operated 
schools and for those Indian-controlled contract schools which adopt 
these standards and to establish national criteria for dormitory 
situations for schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs

[[Page 117]]

and for Indian-controlled contract schools operating dormitories.
    (b) These academic standards and dormitory criteria will take effect 
thirty (30) days after the date of their publication in the Federal 
Register. The Bureau of Indian Affairs intends to review and evaluate 
the applicability of the academic standards and dormitory criteria under 
this part after two years and make appropriate revisions.
    (c) The information collection requirement contained in 
Sec. 36.61(a) has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1076-0092. The 
information is being collected to evaluate waiver request(s) from tribal 
government(s) and school board(s). The information will be used to 
ascertain the approval of academic waiver request. The obligation to 
respond is mandatory under 25 U.S.C. 2001. The information collection 
requirements contained in Secs. 36.71(g), 36.74(f), and 36.76(b) of this 
rule are not required to be approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget since less than ten persons or tribes are affected by the 
information collection requirement of this rule. However, when ten or 
more persons or tribes become affected by this requirement, the Bureau 
will submit an approval request.


<R05>
Sec. 36.2  Applicability.

    (a) The minimum academic standards for the basic education of Indian 
children established under this part, subparts B through G, are 
mandatory for all Bureau of Indian Affairs operated schools unless a 
tribal governing body or the local school board, if so designated by the 
tribal governing body, waives, in part or in whole, the standards 
established under this part. When a tribe(s) formally takes action to 
waive, in total or in part, standards contained in this part, proof of 
such action shall be forwarded to the Agency Superintendent for 
Education (ASE) or area Education Programs Administrator (EPA). Within 
15 days of receipt of such documentation the ASE or EPA shall notify, in 
writing, the parents or legal guardians whose children are attending the 
school(s) affected.
    (b) The minimum academic standards for the education of Indian 
children established under subparts B through G are not applicable to 
Indian-controlled contract schools unless the Indian-controlled contract 
school board formally adopts them in whole or in part. The Bureau will 
not refuse to enter into a contract on the basis of failure to meet 
these standards but will, through contracting procedures, assist the 
school in reaching compliance, if so requested by the Indian-controlled 
contract school board.
    (c) The national criteria for dormitory situations established under 
subpart H will serve as a minimum requirement and shall be mandatory for 
all Bureau-operated and Indian-controlled contract schools.
    (d) Standards and criteria contained under this part will serve as 
minimum requirements for the regular school educational program.
    (e) In states where additional minimum academic standards exist or 
are established, those state standards shall also apply.

Pub. L. 95-561 or title 5 U.S.C.
    (1) Pay periods. Educators shall be paid on the basis of a biweekly 
pay period during the term of the contract. Chapter 55 of title 5 U.S.C. 
applies to the administration of pay for educators, except that section 
1131(m) of Pub. L. 95-561 provides that 5 U.S.C. 5533 does not apply 
with respect to the receipt of pay by educators during summer recess 
under certain circumstances.
    (2) Pay for contract educators. When an educator is appointed, 
payment under the contract is to begin as of the effective date of the 
contract. If an educator resigns or is discharged before the expiration 
of the term of the contract, pay ceases as of the date of resignation or 
discharge.
    (3) Prorating of pay. Within 30 days prior to the beginning of the 
academic school term, each educator must elect whether to have the 
annual contractual rate or basic pay prorated over the contractual 
academic school term, or to have the basic pay prorated over a 12-month 
period.
    (i) Each educator may change such election once during the academic 
school term, provided notice is given two weeks prior to the end of the 
fifth month after the beginning of the academic school term.
    (ii) An educator who elects a 12-month basis of prorated pay may 
further elect to be paid in one lump sum at the end of the academic 
school term for the then remaining amount of rate of basic pay otherwise 
due, provided notice is given four weeks prior to the end of the 
academic school term.
    (iii) No educator shall suffer a loss of pay or benefits because of 
elections made under this section.
    (4) Stipends for extracurricular activities. An employee, if 
assigned to sponsor an approved extracurricular activity, may elect 
annually at the beginning of the contract to be paid a stipend in lieu 
of overtime premium pay or compensatory time when the employee performs 
additional activities to provide services to students or otherwise 
support the school's academic and social programs.
    (i) The Director is authorized to establish a schedule of stipends 
for each Bureau Area, taking into consideration types of activities to 
be compensated and payments provided by public school districts in or 
near the Area.
    (ii) The stipend shall be a supplement to the employee's base pay 
and is not a part of salary for retirement computation purposes.
    (iii) The employee shall be paid the stipend in equal payments over 
the period of the extracurricular activity.

Sec. 38.7  Appointment of educators.

    (a) Local school employees. Local Bureau school employees shall be 
appointed only by the school supervisor. Before the local school 
employee is employed, the school board shall be consulted. An 
individual's appointment may be finalized only upon receipt of a formal 
written determination certified by the local school board under such 
uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school 
board should be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 
30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall 
have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The local school 
board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an appointment. 
The school supervisor may appeal to the ASE, or, where appropriate, to 
the AEPA, any determination by the local school board concerning an 
individual's appointment. A written statement of appeal describing the 
action and the reasons the supervisor believes such action should be 
overturned must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the action from 
the local school board. A copy of such statement shall be submitted to 
the school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to 
respond, not to exceed 10 calendar days, in writing, to the appeal. 
After reviewing such written appeal and response, the ASE or AEPA may, 
for cause, overturn the action of the local school board. The ASE or 
AEPA must transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a 
written opinion) to the board and to

[[Page 141]]

the supervisor identifying the reasons for overturning the action within 
10 calender days. Failure to act within the 10 calendar day period shall 
have the effect of approving the local school board's determination.
    (b) School supervisors. School supervisors may be appointed only by 
the ASE, except the AEPA shall appoint school supervisors for off-
reservation boarding schools and those few other schools supervised by 
the AEPA. The school board shall be consulted before the school 
supervisor is employed. The appointment may be finalized upon receipt of 
a formal written determination certified by the school board under any 
uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school 
board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 
days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have 
the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The school board shall 
use the same procedure to disapprove an appontment. Within 20 calendar 
days of receipt of any determination by the school board concerning an 
individual's appointment, the ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, may appeal to 
the Director by filing a written statement describing the determination 
and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination should be 
overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the local 
school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, 
within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such an appeal. The Director may 
reverse the determination for cause set out in writing to the school 
board. Within 20 calendar days of the school board's response, the 
Director shall transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of 
a written opinion) to the board and to the ASE or AEPA identifying the 
reasons for overturning the determination. Failure by the Director to 
act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving 
the school board's determination.
    (c) Agency office education program employees. Appointments to 
Agency office education positions may be made only by the ASE. The 
Agency school board shall be consulted before the agency education 
employee is employed, and the appointment may be finalized upon receipt 
of a formal, written determination certified by the Agency school board 
under any uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by 
the school board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not 
to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period 
shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The Agency 
school board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an 
appointment. Within 20 calendar days of receipt of any determination by 
the school board concerning an individual's appointment, the ASE may 
appeal to the Director by filing a written statement describing the 
determination and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination 
should be overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the 
Agency school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to 
respond, within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such appeal. After 
reviewing the written appeal and response, the Director may, for cause, 
overturn the determination of the Agency school board. Within 20 days of 
the board's response, the Director shall transmit the determination of 
the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the 
ASE identifying the reasons for overturning the determination. Failure 
of the Director to act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the 
effect of approving the school's board's determination.
    (d) Employment contracts. The Bureau shall issue employment 
contracts each year for individuals employed in contract education 
positions at the Agency or school levels.
    (e) Absence of local school boards. Where a local school board has 
not been established in accordance with section 1139(7) Pub. L. 95-561 
with respect to a Bureau school, or where a school board is not 
operational, and the local school board is required to be given a notice 
or required to be consulted by statute or these regulations, the 
official involved shall notify or consult with the Agency school board 
serving the tribe(s) to which the parents of the Indian children 
atending that school belong, or, in that absence,

[[Page 142]]

the tribal organization(s) of the tribe(s) involved.
    (f) Provisional contracts. Provisional certification or other 
limited certificates from the State are not considered full 
certification and only a provisional contract may be issued. There may 
be circumstances when no individual who has met the full certification 
or experience requirements is available for a professional position or 
when a status quo employee who does not meet full certification or 
experience requirements desires to convert to contract. When this 
situation exists, a provisional contract may be issued in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) The contract will be made only:
    (i) After it is determined that an individual already meeting 
certification or experience requirements is not available; or
    (ii) For conversion of a status quo employee who does not yet meet 
all established position requirements.
    (2) Consultation with the appropriate school board is required prior 
to the contract.
    (3) The contract may be of 12-month or school-term duration.
    (4) The employee will be required to make satisfactory progress 
toward meeting full qualification requirements.
    (5) If the employee fails to meet the requirements established under 
Sec. 38.7(f)(4), the contract will be terminated. Such termination 
cannot be grieved or appealed.
    (g) Conditional appointment. As provided in section 1131(d)(4), Pub. 
L. 95-561, if an individual who has applied at both the national and 
local levels is appointed from a local list of applicants, the 
appointment shall be conditional for 90 days. During that period, the 
individual's application and background shall be examined to determine 
if there is a more qualified individual for the position. Removal during 
this period is not subject to discharge, hearing or grievance 
procedures.
    (h) Short-term contracts. (1) There may be circumstances where 
immediate action is necessary and it is impossible to consult with the 
local school board. When this situation exists short-term contracts may 
be made by the school supervisor in accordance with the following:
    (i) The length of the contract will not exceed 60 days, or the next 
regularly scheduled school board meeting, whichever comes first.
    (ii) If the board meets and does not take action on the individual 
in question, the short-term contract may be extended for the duration of 
the school year.
    (iii) It shall be the responsibility of the school supervisor to 
fully inform the local school board of all such short-term contracts. 
Failure to do so may be cited as reason to discharge the school 
supervisor if so requested by the board.
    (2) The local school board may authorize the school supervisor to 
make an emergency short-term contract to classroom, dormitory and other 
positions directly related to the health and safety of students. When 
this situation exists, short-term contracts may be made in accordance 
with the following:
    (i) If local and agency lists of qualified applicants are exhausted, 
short-term contracts may be made without regard to qualifications for 
the position;
    (ii) The pay level will be based on the qualifications of the 
individual employed rather than the requirements of the position, if the 
qualifications of the individual are lower than required;
    (iii) The short-term contract may not exceed the school term and may 
not be renewed or extended;
    (iv) Every 60 days the school supervisor will determine if qualified 
individuals have been placed on the local or agency lists. If a 
qualified individual on the list accepts employment, the school 
supervisor must terminate the emergency appointment at the time the 
qualified individual is appointed.
    (i) Temporary contracts. There may be circumstances where a specific 
position is needed for a period of one year or less. Under these 
conditions a position may be advertised as a temporary position and be 
filled under a temporary contract. Such contract requires the same 
school board approval as a school year contract. If required for the 
completion of the activities specified in the original announcement, the 
position,

[[Page 143]]

may with school board approval be extended for up to one additional 
year. Temporary contracts may be terminated at any time and this action 
is not subject to approval or grievance procedures.
    (j) Waiver of Indian preference. Notwithstanding any provision of 
the Indian preference laws, such laws shall not apply in the case of any 
personnel action within the purview of this section respecting an 
application or employee not entitled to Indian preference if each tribal 
organization concerned grants, in writing, a waiver of the application 
of such laws with respect to such personnel action, where such a waiver 
is in writing deemed to be a necessity by the tribal organization, 
except that this shall in no way relieve the Bureau of its 
responsibility to issue timely and adequate announcements and 
advertisements concerning any such personnel action if it is intended to 
fill a vacancy (no matter how such vacancy is created). When a waiver is 
granted, it shall apply only to that particular position and as long as 
the employee remains in that position.
    (k) Prohibited reappointment. An educator who voluntarily terminates 
employment before the end of the school term may not be appointed to 
another Bureau education position before the beginning of the following 
school term. An educator will not be deemed to have voluntarily 
terminated employment if transferred elsewhere with the consent of the 
local school or Agency boards.
    (l) Contract renewals. The appropriate school board shall be 
notified in writing by the school supervisor and/or ASE or AEPA not less 
than 90 days before the end of the school term whether or not an 
individual's contract is recommended for renewal.
    (1) If the school board disagrees with the school supervisor's or 
ASE's or AEPA's recommendations, the board will submit a formal, written 
certification of its determinations to the school supervisor or ASE or 
AEPA within 25 days. If the board's determinations are not received 
within the 25 days, the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA shall issue the 
60 day notification of renewal or nonrenawal to the individual as 
required under Sec. 38.8.
    (2) When the school board submits its determination within the 25 
days and determines that a contract will be renewed, or nonrenewed, the 
appropriate official shall issue the required renewal notice, or 
nonrenawal, or appeal the determination of the school board to the 
appropriate official who will make a determination in accordance with 
the appeal procedure is Sec. 38.7(a) of this part. After the 
probationary period, if the determination is that the contract will not 
be renewed, the procedures specified in Sec. 38.8 shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 38.8  Nonrenewal of contract.

    Where the determination is made that an employee's contract shall 
not be renewed for the following year, the following procedure will 
apply to those employees who have completed three full continuous school 
terms of service under consecutive contract appointments and 
satisfactory performance in the same or comparable education positions.
    (a) The employee will be given a written notice of the action and 
the reasons thereof not less than 60 days before the end of the school 
term.
    (b) The employee will be given 10 calendar days to request an 
informal hearing before the appropriate official or body. Upon request, 
the employee may be given official time, not to exceed eight hours, to 
prepare a written response to the reason(s).
    (c) If so requested, an informal hearing shall be held within 30 
calendar days of receipt of the request.
    (d) The appropriate official or body will render a written 
determination within seven calendar days after the informal hearing.
    (e) The employee has a right to request an administrative review by 
the ASE or AEPA of the determination within 10 calendar days of that 
determination. The ASE or AEPA then has 20 calendar days to render a 
final decision. Where the employee is the supervisor of the school or an 
agency education employee, any appeal of the ASE or AEPA would be 
addressed to the Director for a decision. If the Director or ASE's or 
AEPA's decision overturns the appropriate official or bodies 
determination, the appropriate official or body will be notified of the

[[Page 144]]

reasons in writing. Failure by the Director or ASE or AEPA to act within 
the 20 days will sustain the determination. This completes the 
administrative appeal process.
    (f) Failure of any of the parties to meet the requirements of the 
above procedures will serve to negate the particular action sought by 
the negligent party.
    (g) Those employees with less than three full continuous school 
terms of consecutive contract appointments are serving a probationary 
period. Nonrenewal of his/her contract will be considered a continuation 
of the examining process. This action cannot be appealed or grieved.
    (h) Independent of the procedures outlined in this section, the 
school supervisor or ASE or AEPA, for applicable positions, shall be 
required to submit to the ASE or AEPA or appropriate higher authority 
all nonrenewal actions. Within 60 days, the ASE or AEPA shall review the 
nonrenewal actions and may overturn the determination of nonrenewal. In 
the event that the ASE or AEPA makes a decision to overturn the school 
board determination, the ASE or AEPA shall notify the school board in 
writing of his/her reasons for doing so.
    (i) No more than the substantial standard of evidence shall be 
required to sustain the nonrenewal.
    (j) A procedural error shall not be grounds for overturning a 
determination of nonrenewal unless the employee shows harmful error in 
the application of the Agency's procedures in arriving at such a 
decision. For purposes of this section, ``harmful error'' means error by 
the Agency in the application of its procedures which, in the absence or 
cure of the error, might have caused the Agency to reach a conclusion 
different than the one reached. The burden is upon the appellant to show 
that based upon the record as a whole, the error was harmful. i.e., 
caused substantial harm or prejudice to his/her rights.
    (k) Nonrenewal of a contract is not discharge and will not follow 
the discharge procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 38.9  Discharge of educators.

    (a) Discharge for cause. Educators covered under the provision of 
this section are excluded from coverage under 5 U.S.C. 7511 and 4303. In 
order to provide due process for educators, the Director shall publish 
in 62 BIAM representative conditions that could result in the discharge 
of educators for cause and procedures to be followed in discharge cases.
    (b) Discharge for inadequate performance. Action to remove educators 
for inadequate performance will be taken for failure to meet performance 
standards established under 5 U.S.C. 4302. Performance standards for all 
educators will include, among others, lack of student achievement. 
Willful failure to exercise properly assigned supervisory 
responsibilities by supervisors shall also be cause for discharge.
    (c) Other discharge. The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM a 
description of the budgetary and programmatic conditions that may result 
in the discharge of educators for other than cause during the school 
term. The individual's personnel record will clearly reflect that the 
action taken is based upon budgetary or programmatic restraints and is 
not a reflection on the employee's performance.
    (d) Procedures for discharge for cause. The Director shall publish 
in 62 BIAM the procedural steps to be followed by school supervisors, 
ASE's, and AEPA's in discharge for cause cases. These procedures shall 
provide (among other things) for the following:
    (1) The educator to be discharged shall receive a written notice of 
the proposal, specifying the causes or complaints upon which the 
proposal is based, not less than 30 calendar days before the discharge. 
However, this shall not prohibit the exclusion of the individual from 
the education facility in cases where exclusion is required for the 
safety of the students or the orderly operation of the facility.
    (2) A reasonable time, but not less than 10 calendar days, will be 
allotted for the individual to make written and/or oral responses to the 
charge.
    (3) An opportunity will be afforded the individual to review the 
material relied upon to support the charge.
    (4) Official time, not to exceed eight hours, will be provided to 
the individual to prepare a response to the charge.

[[Page 145]]

    (5) The educator may elect to have a representative and shall 
furnish the identity of any representative to the ASE or AEPA. The ASE 
or AEPA may disallow, as an employee representative, any individual 
whose activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest 
or position, or an employee whose release from his or her official 
position would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government, or 
when priority work assignment precludes his or her release from official 
duties. The terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and 
5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5) shall govern representation of employees in an 
exclusive bargaining unit.
    (6) The individual has a right to a final decision made by the 
appropriate level of supervision.
    (7) The individual has a right to appeal the final decision and have 
the merits of the case reviewed by a Departmental official not 
previously involved in the case. This right includes entitlement to a 
hearing upon request under procedures in accordance with the 
requirements of due process under section 1131(e)(1)(B) of Pub. L. 95-
561.
    (e) School board action. (1) The appropriate school board shall be 
notified as soon as possible, but in no case later than 10 calendar days 
from the date of issue of the notice of intent to discharge.
    (2) The appropriate school board, under any uniform procedure as it 
may adopt, may issue a formal written certification to the school 
supervisor, ASE, or AEPA either approving or disapproving the discharge 
before the expiration of the notice period and before actual discharge. 
Failure to respond before the expiration of the notice period will have 
the effect of approving the discharge.
    (3) The school supervisor initiating a discharge action may appeal 
the board's determination to the ASE or AEPA within 10 calendar days of 
receipt of the board's notice. The ASE or AEPA initiating a discharge 
may appeal the board's determination to the Director within 10 calendar 
days of receipt of the board's notice. Within 20 calendar days following 
the receipt of an appeal, the reviewing official may, for good cause, 
reverse the school board's determination by a notice in writing to the 
board. Failure to act within 20 calendar days shall have the effect of 
approving the board's determination.
    (f) School board recommendations for discharge. School boards may 
recommend in writing to school supervisors, ASE's, or AEPA's, and the 
Director that individuals in the education program be discharged. These 
written recommendations may follow any procedures formally established 
internally by the school board or tribal government. However, the 
written recommendations must contain specific causes or complaints that 
may be verified or established by investigation of factual situations. 
The official receiving a board recommendation for discharge of an 
individual shall acknowledge the recommendation in writing within 10 
calendar days of receipt and proceed with a fact finding investigation. 
The official who finally disposes of the recommendation shall notify the 
school board of the disposition in writing within 60 calendar days of 
initiation of the fact finding investigation.


<R05>
Sec. 38.10  Conditions of employment of educators.

    (a) Supervision not delegated to school boards. School boards may 
not direct, control, or interrupt the day-to-day activities of BIA 
employees carrying out Bureau-operated education programs.
    (b) Employee handbook. Employee handbook and recruiting guides shall 
be developed by each local school or agency to provide specific 
information regarding:
    (1) The working and hiring conditions for various tribal 
jurisdictions and Bureau locations;
    (2) The need for all education personnel to adapt to local 
situations; and
    (3) The requirement of all education personnel to comply with and 
support duly adopted school board policies, including those relating to 
tribal culture or language.
    (c) Contract renewal notification. Employees will be notified 60 
calendar days before the end of the school term of the intent to renew 
or not renew their contract. If an individual's contract is to be 
renewed, the individual must agree in writing to serve for the

[[Page 146]]

next school term. This agreement must be received within 14 calendar 
days of the date of the notice in order to complete the contract 
renewal. If this agreement is not received by the fourteenth day, the 
employee has voluntarily forfeited his or her right to continuing 
employment. If an individual agrees to serve for the next school term 
and fails to report for duty at the beginning of the next school term, 
the contract will be terminated and the individual's future appointment 
will be subject to the restriction in Sec. 38.7(k) of this part.
    (d) Dual compensation. An employee accepting a renewal of a school 
term contract may be appointed to another Federal position during the 
school recess period without regard to the dual compensation regulations 
in 5 U.S.C. 5533.
    (e) Discrimination complaints. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
procedures established under 29 CFR part 1613 are applicable to contract 
employees under this part. It is the policy of the BIA that all 
employees and applicants for employment shall be treated equally when 
considered for employment or benefits of employment, regardless of race, 
color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or mental or physical health 
(handicap), within the parameters of Indian preference.
    (f) Grievance procedures. The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM 
procedures for the rapid and equitable resolution of grievances. In 
locations and for positions covered by an exclusive bargaining 
agreement, the negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive avenue of 
redress for all matters within the scope of the negotiated grievance 
procedure.
    (g) Performance evaluation. The minimum number of times a supervisor 
shall meet with an employee to discuss performance and suggest 
improvements shall be once every three months for the educator's first 
year at a school or Agency, and twice annually thereafter during the 
school term.


<R05>
Sec. 38.11  Length of the regular school term.

    The length of the regular school term shall be at least 180 student 
instructional days, unless a waiver has been granted under the 
provisions of 25 CFR 36.61.


<R05>
Sec. 38.12  Leave system for education personnel.

    (a) Full-time school-term employees. Employees on a full-time 
school-term contract are authorized the following types of leave:
    (1) Personal leave. A school-term employee will receive 28 hours of 
personal leave to be used for personal reasons and 12 hours of emergency 
leave. This leave only accrues provided the length of the contract 
exceeds 24 weeks.
    (i) The school-term employee will request the use of this leave in 
advance when it is for personal use or personal business (e.g., going to 
the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for emergency purposes 
(e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately 
after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before 
leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the 
official work day.
    (ii) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be 
taken only during the school term. No compensation for or carryover of 
unused leave is authorized.
    (2) Sick leave. Sick leave is an absence approved by the supervisor 
for incapacity from duty due to injury or illness, not related to or 
incurred on-the-job and not covered by the Federal Employee's 
Compensation Act Regulations. Medical and dental appointments may be 
included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental 
appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.
    (i) Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of four hours each biweekly 
pay period in pay status during the term of the contract; and no 
precredit or advance of sick leave is authorized.
    (ii) Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be 
recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of 
separation.
    (3) School vacation. School term employees may receive up to 136 
hours of school vacation time for use when school is not in session. 
School vacations are scheduled on the annual school calendar during the 
instructional year and may not be scheduled

[[Page 147]]

before the first day of student instruction or after the last day of 
student instruction. School vacations are not a right of the employee 
and cannot be paid for or carried over if the employee is required to 
work during the school vacation time or if the program will not permit 
school term employees to take such vacation time.
    (b) Leave for full-time, year-long employees. Employees who are on a 
full-time, year-long contract are authorized the following types of 
leave:
    (1) Vacation leave. Absence approved in advance by the supervisor 
for rest and relaxation or other personal reasons is authorized on a per 
year basis of Federal Government service as follows: years 1 and 2 of 
employment--120 hours; years 3-5 of employment--160 hours; 6 or more 
years--200 hours. The supervisor will determine when vacation leave may 
be used. Vacation leave is to be scheduled and used to the greatest 
extent possible during periods when school is not in session and the 
students are not in the dormitories. Vacation leave is credited to an 
employee on the day following his or her date of employment, provided 
the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks. An employee may carry into 
succeeding years up to 200 hours of vacation leave. Leave unused at the 
time of separation is forfeited.
    (2) Sick leave. Sick leave accumulation and use is authorized on the 
same basis as for school term employees under Sec. 38.12(a)(2) of this 
part.
    (c) Leave for part-time year-long employees. Employees who are on 
part-time year-long contracts exceeding 20 hours per week are authorized 
the following types of leave:
    (1) Vacation leave. Absence approved in advance by the supervisor 
for rest and relaxation or other personal reasons is authorized on a per 
year basis of Federal Government service as follows: years 1 and 2 of 
employment--64 hours; years 3-5 of employment--80 hours; 6 or more 
years--104 hours. The supervisor shall determine when vacation leave may 
be used. Vacation leave is to be scheduled and used to the greatest 
extent possible during periods when school is not in session and the 
students are not in the dormitories. Vacation leave is credited to an 
employee on the day following his or her date of employment provided the 
length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks and may not be accumulated in 
excess of 104 hours from year to year. An employee may carry over up to 
104 hours from one contract year to the next. Leave unused at the time 
of separation is forfeited.
    (2) Sick leave. Sick leave is accumulated on the basis of three 
hours each biweekly pay period in pay status; no precredit or advance of 
sick leave is authorized. Accumulated sick leave at the time of 
separation will be recredited to an educator who is reemployed within 
three years of separation.
    (d) Leave for school term employees on a part-time work schedule in 
excess of 20 hours per week. (1) Employees on a part-time work schedule 
in excess of 20 hours per week may receive a maximum of 102 hours of 
school vacation time; 20 hours of personal/emergency leave; and 63 hours 
of sick leave accrued at three hours per pay period for the first 21 pay 
periods of their contracts. Personal/emergency leave only accrues 
provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.
    (2) The part-time employee will request the use of this leave in 
writing in advance when it is for personal use or personal business 
(e.g., going to the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for 
emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be 
requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the 
employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports 
to work on the official work day.
    (3) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be 
taken only during the school year. No compensation for or carryover of 
unused leave is authorized.
    (4) Sick leave. Sick leave is an absence approved by the supervisor 
for incapacity from duty due to injury or illness, not related to or 
incurred on-the-job and not covered by the Federal Employee's 
Compensation Act Regulations. Medical and dental appointments may be 
included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental 
appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.

[[Page 148]]

    (i) Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of three hours each biweekly 
pay period in pay status for the first 21 pay periods of their contract; 
no precredit or advance for sick leave is authorized.
    (ii) Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be 
recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of 
separation.
    (5) School vacation time. Part-time employees may receive up to 102 
hours of school vacation time for use when school is not in session. 
Approval for the use of this time will be administratively determined by 
the school supervisor, ASE or AEPA, and this time may not be scheduled 
before the start of school or after the end of school.
    (i) All school vacation time for part-time employees will be 
approved at the convenience of the program and not as a right of the 
employee.
    (ii) Vacation time cannot be paid for or carried over for a part-
time employee if the employee is required to work during the school 
vacation time or if the program will not permit part-time employees to 
take such vacation time.
    (e) Accountable absences for all contract employees. The following 
are considered accountable absences:
    (1) Approved absence. If prescheduled and approved by the school 
supervisor, ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, an employee may be on leave 
without pay.
    (2) Absence without leave. Any absence is not prescheduled or 
approved in advance or excused by the supervisor is considered absence 
without leave.
    (3) Court and military leave. Employees are entitled to paid absence 
for jury or witness service and military duty as a member of the 
National Guard or Reserve under the same terms or conditions as outlined 
in sections 6322 and 6323 of title 5 U.S.C., and corresponding 
provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual, when the absence occurs 
during the regular contract period. Employees may be requested to 
schedule their military leave at times other than when school is in 
session.
    (4) Administrative leave. Administrative leave is an excused absence 
from duty administratively authorized without loss of pay or without 
charge to leave. This leave is not a substitute for other paid or unpaid 
leave categories. Administrative leave usually is authorized on an 
individual basis except when a school is closed or a group of employees 
are excused from work for a particular purpose. The school supervisor, 
ASE or AEPA will grant administrative leave. A school closing must be 
approved by the ASE or AEPA.
    (f) Educators serving with contracts with work weeks of 20 hours a 
week or less are not eligible for any type of paid leave.
    (g) For school term educators, no paid leave is earned nor may 
accumulated leave be used during any period of employment with the 
Bureau between school terms.
    (h) Employees issued contracts for intermittent work are not 
eligible for any type of paid leave.
    (i) Leave transferred in. Annual leave credited to an employee's 
accrued leave balance immediately before conversion to a contract 
education position or appointment under this part will be carried over 
and made available to the employee. Sick leave credited to an employee's 
accrued sick leave balance immediately before conversion to a contract 
education position or appointment under this part shall be credited to 
the employee's sick leave account under the system in Sec. 38.12(a)(2) 
and (b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 38.13  Status quo employees in education positions.

    (a) Status quo employees. Individuals who were Bureau employees on 
October 31, 1979, with an appointment in either the competitive or 
excepted service without time limitation, and who are serving in an 
education position, shall be continued in their positions under the 
terms and conditions of that appointment with no change in their status 
or positions. Such employees are entitled to receive any changes in 
compensation attached to the position. Although such employees occupy 
``education positions'' as defined in this part, the terms and 
conditions of their appointment, status, and entitlements are determined 
by competitive service regulations and procedures. Under applicable 
procedures, these employees

[[Page 149]]

are eligible for consideration for movement to other positions that are 
defined as ``contract education'' positions. Such movement shall change 
the terms and conditions of their appointment to the terms and 
conditions of employment established under this part.
    (b) If the tribe or school board waives the Indian preference law, 
the employee loses the early-out retirement eligibility under Pub. L. 
96-135, ``early-out for non-Indians,'' if they are entitled to the 
early-out retirement. A memorandum for the record on BIA letterhead 
shall be signed by the employee and placed on the permanent side of his/
her Official Personnel Folder, along with the tribal resolution, if the 
tribe/school board has waived the Indian preference law to employ the 
non-Indian.''
    (c) Conversion of status quo employees to contract positions. Status 
quo employees may request in writing to the school supervisor, ASE or 
AEPA, as applicable, that their position be converted to contract. The 
appropriate school board will be consulted and a determination made by 
such school board whether such individual should be converted to a 
contract employee.
    (1) Written determination by the school board should be received 
within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days from receipt of 
the request. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall 
have the effect of disapproving the proposed conversion.
    (2) With school board approval, an involuntary change in position 
shall not affect the current status of status quo education employees.


<R05>
Sec. 38.14  Voluntary services.

    (a) Scope. An ASE or AEPA may, subject to the approval of the local 
school board concerned, accept voluntary services on behalf of Bureau 
schools from the private sector, including individuals, groups, or 
students. Voluntary service shall be for all non-hazardous activities 
where public services, special projects, or school operations are 
improved and enhanced. Volunteer service is limited to personal services 
received without compensation (salary or wages) by the Bureau from 
individuals, groups, and students. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to require Federal employees to work without compensation or 
to allow the use of volunteer services to displace or replace Federal 
employees.
    (b) Volunteer service agreement. An agreement is a written document, 
jointly completed by the volunteer, the Bureau school supervisor, and 
the school board, that outlines the responsibilities of each. In the 
case of students receiving credit for their work (i.e., student 
teaching) from an education institution, the agreement will be jointly 
completed by the student, a representative of the institution, and the 
Bureau school supervisor. In the case of volunteer groups, the agreement 
shall be signed by an official of the volunteering organization, the 
Bureau school supervisor, and the school board and a list of signatures 
and emergency telephone numbers of all participants shall be attached.
    (c) Eligibility. Although no minimum age requirement exists for 
volunteers, schools shall comply with appropriate Federal and State laws 
and standards on using the services of minors. All volunteers under the 
age of 18 must obtain written permission from their parents or guardians 
to perform volunteer activities.
    (d) Status. Volunteers participating under this part are not 
considered Federal employees for any purpose other than:
    (1) Title 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, dealing with compensation for 
injuries sustained during the performance of work assignments.
    (2) Federal tort claims provisions published in 28 U.S.C. chapter 
171.
    (3) Department of the Interior Regulations Governing 
Responsibilities and Conduct.
    (e) Travel and other expenses. The decision to reimburse travel and 
other incidental expenses, as well as the amount of reimbursement, shall 
be made by the school supervisor, ASE, AEPA, and the respective school 
board. Payment is made in the same manner as for regular employees. 
Payment of travel and per diem expenses to a volunteer on a particular 
assignment must be supported by a specific travel authorization and 
cannot exceed the

[[Page 150]]

cost of employing a temporary employee of comparable qualification at 
the school for which a travel authorization is considered.
    (f) Annual report. School supervisors shall submit reports on 
volunteers to the ASE or AEPA by October 31 of each year for the 
preceding year.

<R04>
            Subpart B--The Indian School Equalization Formula


<R05>
Sec. 39.10  Establishment of the formula.

    There is hereby established the Indian School Equalization Formula 
(ISEF). Funds for the instruction and residential care of Indian 
children shall be earned as an entitlement by each local school 
according to a weighted student unit formula. The funds allocated 
through the formula shall be computed as follows:
    (a) The basic instructional average daily membership (ADM) shall be 
counted at each school location as provided for in subpart C of this 
part. From the application of ratios or weights as provided in these 
rules a weighted student unit (WSU) value for each school location is 
derived by multiplying the student count for each program area by the 
weights.
    (b) If the school is a boarding school or a dormitory, the 
residential students will produce program units which will, by the 
application of weights, produce additional WSU's.
    (c) The ADM count of eligible small schools or dormitories may 
generate additional unit supplements.
    (d) All Alaskan schools are eligible under the formula to generate 
supplemental units.
    (e) The total weighted student unit count for each school location 
is then multiplied by a base unit value to derive the estimated dollar 
entitlement to each school(s).

The total amount is made available to each school(s), under the rules 
related to administrative provisions provided in subparts C and D of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 39.11  Definitions.

    Assistance to approved school(s) under this subpart is subject to 
the definitions established in Sec. 39.2 and to the following 
definitions for determining student counts in the various weighted 
areas. As used in the subpart, the term:
    (a) Base or base unit means both the weight or ratio of 1.0 and the 
dollar value annually established for that weight or ratio which 
represents students in grades 4 through 8 in a typical instructional 
program.
    (b) Basic program means the instructional program provided all 
students at any age level exclusive of any supplemental programs which 
are not provided to all students in day or boarding schools.
    (c) Grade or Grade Level, followed in most cases by K or a number, 
means a classroom grouping ordinarily determined by student age and 
successful completion of a criterion number of years of previous 
schoolwork. The use of this term does not preclude ISEP funding of 
programs in which instruction is non-graded or individualized, or which 
otherwise depart from grade-level school structure. For purposes of 
funding under the ISEP, students in such programs shall be counted as in 
the grade level to which they would ordinarily be assigned based on 
their chronological age and number of years of schooling completed.
    (d) Grades 1-3 means a weighted program for a student who is present 
during the count week (see Sec. 39.30(b)) in grades 1 through 3 who is 
at least 6 years old by December 31 of the fall of the school year 
during which the count occurs and is a member of an educational program 
approved by the board which is conducted at least six gross hours daily 
during at least 180 days per school year. Gross hours means from the 
start of the school day to the end of the school day including all 
activities.

[[Page 154]]

    (e) Grades 4-8 and grades 9-12 means a weighted program for a 
student who is present during the count week (see Sec. 39.30(b)) in 
either of the programs encompassing grades 4 through 12 who is a member 
of an educational program approved by the school(s) at least six gross 
hours daily during at least 180 days per school year and shall not have 
achieved the age of 21 nor have received a high school diploma or its 
equivalent.
    (f) Kindergarten means a weighted program for a student who is 
present during the count week (see Sec. 39.30(b)) who is at least 5 
years old by December 31 of the fall of the school year during which the 
count occurs and a member of an educational program approved by the 
school(s) conducted at least four gross hours daily during at least 180 
days per school year. Otherwise eligible students who are in a program 
conducted less than four hours daily, but at least two gross hours daily 
are eligible as half-time kindergarten students.
    (g) Intense Bilingual means a weighted program for a student who is 
present during the count week, whose primary language is not English, 
and who is receiving academic instruction daily through oral and/or 
written forms of an Indian or Alaskan Native language, as well as 
specialized instruction in English for non native speakers of English, 
under resources of the ISEP.
    (h) Intensive residential guidance means the weighted program for a 
resident student that needs special residential services due to one or 
more of the problems identified below, and that appropriate 
documentation is in that student's file as follows:

court records, or from social agency records and a written documentation 
summarizing such data. For all students placed in intensive residential 
guidance programs, there shall be further documentation of a diagnostic 
workup, a placement decision by a minimum of three staff members, and a 
record of an individualized treatment plan for each student that 
specifies service objectives.
    (v) No student shall be classified under Intense residential 
guidance who is eligible for services at a full-time or part-time 
service level because of a handicapping condition as defined under 
Exceptional Child programs in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (i) Exceptional Child Program means weighted programs for students 
who are receiving special education and related services, consistent 
with the identification, evaluation and provisions of a free appropriate 
public education required by part B of the Education of the Handicapped 
Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.; 45 CFR part 121a\1\) and section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794; 45 CFR part 84) and who have

definition of Full-time--High Service Level Exceptional Child Program 
set forth in paragraph (i)(14) of this section.
    (18) Classification of a student in full or part-time service levels 
in residential care programs shall be based upon prior classification of 
the student in an instructional program serving his/her handicapping 
condition.
    (j) Resident means a student officially enrolled in the residential 
care program of a Bureau operated or funded school and actually 
receiving supplemental services provided to all students who are 
provided room and board in a boarding school or a dormitory during those 
weeks when student membership counts are conducted. Such students must 
be members of the instructional program in the same boarding school in 
which they are counted as residents. To be counted as dormitory 
residents, students must be enrolled in and be current members of a 
public school in the community in which they reside.

<R05>
Sec. 39.14  Entitlement for small schools.

    To compensate for the additional costs of operating small schools, 
qualified schools shall receive the following adjustments:
    (a) Instructional programs in day and boarding schools. For each 
separate small school having an instructional average daily membership 
count (called x) of less than 100 students, the formula [(100-x) divided 
by 200] times x shall be used to generate add-on weighted pupil units 
for each such school.
    (b) Boarding school residential programs. For each separate small 
boarding school having a resident average daily membership count (called 
y) of less than 100 students, the formula [(100-y) divided by 200] times 
y shall be used to generate add-on weighted pupil units for each such 
boarding school.
    (c) Dormitory residential programs serving public schools. For each 
small dormitory program having an average daily membership count (called 
z) of less than 100 students, the formula [(100-z) divided by 200] times 
z shall be used to generate add-on weighted pupil units for each 
dormitory.


<R05>
Sec. 39.15  Alaskan school cost supplements.

    To meet the statutory requirements for a salary supplement for 
Alaskan educational staff, and add-on weight of .25 will be used as a 
factor by which all pupil program-generated weighted students shall be 
supplemented. Such generated Alaskan cost supplements will be added to 
the weighted pupil units generated by each school in the same manner as 
small school units.


<R05>
Sec. 39.16  Computation of school entitlements.

    The sum of all weighted student units, including any small school 
and any Alaskan school cost supplements shall be computed for each 
school under the management of the Director. The total number of units 
generated by each approved school shall be multiplied by a base dollar 
value which is equivalent to a base weight of 1.0 in the formula. This 
base value shall be computed annually by the Director by dividing the 
total of all weighted students (WSU) generated by all approved schools 
into the total amount appropriated for distribution through the Indian 
School Equalization Formula.


<R05>
Sec. 39.17  Comparability with public schools.

    (a) In no case shall a Bureau or contract school attended by an 
Indian student receive less under these regulations than the average 
payment from the Federal funds received per Indian student, under other 
provisions of law, by the public school district in which the student 
resides. Any school which is funded at a lower level per student under 
the ISEP than either the average daily expenditure per student for 
instructional costs in the public schools in the State in which it is 
located, or the amount per Indian student which the local public school 
district in which it is located receives from all Federal funding 
sources, shall present

[[Page 158]]

documentation of this fact to the Director of the Office of Indian 
Education Programs.
    (b) Upon verification that comparisons in the documentation received 
cover comparative expenditures, and that the inequity indeed exists, the 
Director shall adjust the school's allocation to equal the payment per-
Indian student of the public school district or State involved.
    (c) Funds for such adjustment shall be taken from the Formula 
Implementation Set Aside established under Sec. 39.78 of these 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 39.18  Recomputations of current year entitlements.

    The Director shall continuously monitor the processes by which the 
final allocation of each school's entitlement is made. When changes 
occur either in the total amount of funds available for the operations 
of schools or in the total number of weighted student units for all 
schools due to a change in the number of weighted student units reported 
or altered by auditing, the Director shall consider whether adjustments 
are necessary in order that the full available appropriations are fairly 
allocated to the schools, and that all funds are fully allotted to 
schools.


<R05>
Sec. 39.19  Phase-in provisions.

    (a) Limits on excess gains. No school shall receive a percentage 
increase in its total fund entitlement, over the comparable budget 
amount per school in the FY 79 Bureau Education budget, which is greater 
than the following percentage ratios:
    (1) In FY 80--20%
    (2) In FY 81--70%
    (b) Limits on excess losses. No school shall receive a percentage 
decrease in its total fund entitlement, below the comparable budget 
amount in the FY 79 Bureau Education budget, which is greater than the 
following percentage ratios:
    (1) In FY 80--10%
    (2) In FY 81--30%
    (c) Effects of limits on losses and gains. Local school gains in 
excess of the above percentage limits for each of the limited years 
shall be returned to the common base for all schools and distributed 
through the formula. Funds to limit losses in excess of the above limits 
shall be withdrawn from the common base for all schools and distributed 
to the schools subject to such excess losses.
    (d) Transfer of fiscal accountability. To allow time for developing 
fiscal accountability, knowledge, skill and responsibility at the local 
school level and in order to support accountability by responsible 
Fiscal Agents under section 3679 of the Revised Statutes (the Anti-
Deficiency Act), a period of one year (FY 1980) shall be used during 
which the legal allottee for each Bureau-operated school shall be the 
Education Superintendent of the Agency within which the school is 
located. In the case of off-reservation boarding schools and other 
Bureau-operated schools not served by an Agency Education Office, the 
Area Education Director shall be the legal allottee. Further allocation 
of funds under this rule shall be fully in accordance with the Indian 
School Equalization Program and Formula, and expenditures shall be made 
in accordance with the financial planning provisions of section E of 
this rule.
    (e) Beginning in FY 1981, the allottee shall be as otherwise 
determined in this rule.


<R05>
Sec. 39.20  Development of uniform, objective and auditable student weighted area placement criteria and guidelines.

    The Director shall develop:
    (a) Uniform, objective and auditable placement criteria and 
guidelines for placement of students in dormitories and residential care 
programs of boarding schools and in special weighted program areas which 
expand upon the definitions in this part; and
    (b) A uniform and auditable system of enrollment criteria and 
attendance boundaries for each school in the Bureau educational program.
The Director shall publish these criteria and guidelines in the Bureau 
Manual (BIAM) and widely disseminate them to each school prior to 
September 1, 1980, so that appropriate student placements can occur 
before the FY 1981 October student count.

[[Page 159]]


<R05>
Sec. 39.21  Future considerations for weighted programs.

    (a) Within twelve months of the final publication of this rule, the 
Director shall review the following factors in depth, and determine 
whether to incorporate each into the weighted pupil formula:
    (1) A rural isolation adjustment.
    (2) A staff cost adjustment.
    (3) A gifted and talented student program.
    (4) A vocational education program.
    (5) A facilities operation and maintenance program.
    (6) Additional institutional size factors.
    (b) The Director may also recommend incorporation of other factors, 
based upon the Bureau's experience in the first year's operation of the 
ISEP, and upon the Standards to be developed under section 1121 of the 
Act.
    (c) The Director shall also review the adequacy of the weighted 
factors, procedures, criteria and definitions now in this rule, 
throughout part 39. On the basis of this review, the Director shall 
present a comprehensive report of findings, with recommendations for 
amendment of this rule, to the Secretary, who shall incorporate them in 
a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to include a minimum of sixty (60) days 
for public comment.


<R05>
Sec. 39.22  Authorization of new program development, and termination of programs.

    (a) Within one year of the final publication of this rule, the 
Secretary shall develop uniform procedures and criteria for the 
authorization of new schools where no Bureau funded or operated school 
program has previously existed, and for authorization of expansions of 
existing Bureau funded or operated school programs to serve additional 
age groups not previously served. These procedures and criteria shall be 
published as amendments to this rule under a new Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, which shall contain provisions for a minimum of sixty (60) 
days of public review and comment prior to final publication.
    (b) Procedures and criteria developed under this section shall be 
integrated with existing procedures under 25 CFR part 271 for 
determining contractable functions of the Bureau, in order to produce a 
coherent system for authorization of Tribally initiated program 
development under contracting procedures of Pub. L. 93-638, which is 
compatible with Bureau initiated program development.
    (c) Procedures and criteria developed under this rule shall also 
contain provisions for making decisions regarding closing schools and 
terminating Bureau programs of education. These shall provide for full 
consultation with the Indian persons and Tribes served by the programs 
and schools involved in any such decisions.


<R05>
Sec. 39.23  Review of contract schools supplemental funds.

    Before the end of formula phase-in, the Director shall consider the 
impact on equalization of supplemental funds appropriated for aid to 
schools under the Johnson O'Malley Act and under title IV of the Indian 
Education Act, which are available to contract schools but not to Bureau 
schools, and determine appropriate adjustments, if any. Any adjustments 
in the ISEP which results from this review shall be effected by formal 
revision of this rule, under a Notice of Intended Rulemaking published 
in the Federal Register, and shall be subject to public comment for a 
minimum of sixty (60) days prior to final rulemaking.

Sec. 41.1  Purpose.

    The policy of the Department of the Interior is to support and 
encourage the establishment, operation, and improvement of tribally 
controlled community colleges to ensure continued and expanded 
educational opportunities for Indian students. The regulations in this 
subpart prescribe procedures for providing financial and technical 
assistance to this end under the Tribally Controlled Community College 
Assistance Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-471, 92 Stat. 1325, 25 U.S.C. 1801 et 
seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 41.2  Scope.

    The regulations in this subpart are applicable to the provision of 
financial and technical assistance to Community Colleges under title I 
of the Act. They do not apply to the provision of assistance to Navajo 
Community College. Subpart B of this part applies to assistance to 
Navajo Community College under title II of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 41.3  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart A:
    (a) Academic term means a semester, trimester, or other such period 
(not less than six (6) weeks in duration) into which a community college 
normally subdivides its academic year, but does not include a summer 
term.
    (b) Academic year means a twelve month period established by a 
community college and approved by the Director of Education as the 
annual period for the operation of the college's education programs.
    (c) The Act means the Tribally Controlled Community College

Tribes, or (2) is established or is otherwise sanctioned or chartered by 
resolution, ordinance, or other official action (which is still in full 
force and effect) of such governing body or bodies. However, for 
purposes of this definition, only one such institution shall be 
recognized with respect to any one Tribe. A Community College that meets 
the requirements of this definition with respect to more than one Tribe

no other currently formally controlled, operated and managed, 
established, sanctioned, or chartered Community College.
    (f) Director of Education means the Director of the Office of Indian 
Education Programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or his/her duly

time for an entire academic term at a community college (determined on 
the basis of the quotient of the sum of credit hours for which all such 
part-time students are registered during such academic term, divided by 
twelve (12)), calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at 
the conclusion of the sixth week of an academic term. The formula for 
calculating the Indian FTE for an academic term is expressed 
mathematically as FTE=FT+PTCR/12 where FT is the number of full time 
Indian students (those carrying 12 or more credit hours at the end of 
the sixth week of the academic term) and PTCR is the number of credit 
hours for which part-time Indian students are

[[Page 174]]

registered at the end of the sixth week of an academic term.

considering the resources available to the institution, the period of 
time, if any, during which it has operated, the effort it is making to 
meet accreditation standards and the purpose for which this 
determination is being made, that the institution will meet the 
accreditation standards of such an agency or association within a 
reasonable time, or
    (B) Is an institution whose credits are accepted, on transfer, by 
not less than three institutions which are so accredited, for credit on 
the same basis as if transferred from an institution so accredited.

Such term also includes any school which provides not less than a one-
year program of training to prepare students for gainful employment in a 
recognized occupation and which meets the provisions of clauses (1), 
(2), (3), and (4). Such term also includes a public or nonprofit private

education programs and expected revenues from all sources for the 
academic year to which the information applies;
    (9) An assurance that the Community College will not deny admission 
to any Indian student because that student is not a member of a specific 
tribe or because such student is a member of a specific tribe, and will 
comply with the requirements set forth in Sec. 41.11 of this subpart 
together with any request and justification for a specific waiver of any 
requirement of 25 CFR part 276 which the Community College believes to 
be inappropriate;

[[Page 177]]

    (c)(1) Within thirty (30) days of receiving an application required 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the Director of Education shall 
review the application submitted by the Community College and any 
comments with respect thereto filed by the Tribe(s) or by any national 
Indian organization(s) whose assistance has been requested by the 
Community College, and make a grant award in an amount determined under 
paragraph (d) of this section to the Community College if the 
application qualifies the Community College to receive a grant.
    (2) In the case of any Community College whose application is not 
approved, the Director shall promptly send a notice of such action to 
the Community College. Such notice shall include a statement of the 
specific reasons for not approving the application and a statement 
advising the College of its right within thirty (30) days to amend or 
supplement the application on file to rectify the defect.
    (3) Final disapproval of a grant application by the Director after 
the thirty day period referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
or a failure of the Director of Education to approve an application 
within thirty (30) days of its receipt may be appealed by a Community 
College in the same manner as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of 
Sec. 41.7.
    (4) A Grant award under an approved application shall be evidenced 
by a grant agreement, signed by the Director of Education, incorporating 
the application and the provisions required by Sec. 41.11.
    (d)(1) In fiscal year 1980, each Community College which qualifies 
for a grant will receive a grant for academic year 1979-80; thereafter 
each Community College which qualifies for a grant shall receive a grant 
for the academic year commencing after the date of approval of its 
application. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
grants shall be in an amount equal to $4,000 multiplied by the number of 
FTE Indian students in attendance at such college during each academic 
term divided by the number of academic terms in the academic year, 
except that no such grant shall exceed the annual operating expenses of 
the education programs provided by the Community College. The 
mathematical formula for calculating the base grant is BG (Base Grant)=

where FTE is the Indian FTE for each of the academic terms during the 
academic year calculated in conformity with Sec. 41.3(g) of this subpart 
and N is the number of academic terms in the academic year.
    (2) For the first Federal fiscal year for which funds are 
appropriated for grants under this subpart, not less than eight (8) nor 
more than fifteen (15) grants shall be approved; priority in awarding 
such grants shall be given to Community Colleges which are operating on 
October 17, 1978, and which have a history of service to the Indian 
people. (If more than fifteen (15) Community Colleges meeting these two 
(2) conditions submit applications for the first fiscal year, a further 
priority for awarding grants among them shall be given to those who 
appear to be in the best position to fulfill the purpose of the Act and 
to those whose continued existence would be threatened if they did not 
receive such a grant).
    (3) All grants under this section shall be subject to the 
availability of appropriations and the amount thereof shall be ratably 
reduced for all Community Colleges if the sums appropriated for any 
fiscal year for financial assistance under this subpart are not 
sufficient to pay the full amounts to which the eligible Community 
Colleges are otherwise entitled under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) The Director of Education shall authorize payments to each such 
Community College in advance installments by letter of credit or 
Treasury check in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the grant 
amount available for allotment to such Community College for such 
academic year under paragraph (d) of this section on or before October 
1st of such College's academic year (except for 1979-80) or the first 
day on which appropriations for the fiscal year beginning on such date

[[Page 178]]

are available for obligation by BIA whichever occurs later, based on the 
number of FTE Indian students calculated on the basis of registrations 
as in effect at the conclusion of the sixth week of the final academic 
term of the preceding academic year. On or before January 1st (or such 
other date that is the first day of the fifth month) of such College's 
academic year, payments shall be made in the form of advance 
installments to each Community College in an amount equal to seventy-
five percent (75%) of the grant amount available for allotment to such 
Community College for such academic year under paragraph (d) of this 
section, calculated on the basis of registrations at the conclusion of 
sixth week of the academic year, less the amount previously advanced for 
such academic year. On or before July 1st (or such other date that is 
the first day of the eleventh month) of each such academic year the 
balance of the grant amount to which each College is entitled under 
paragraph (d) of this section shall be paid to such College. In the 
event that additional sums are appropriated to which such Community 
Colleges are entitled under section 110(a) of the Act and paragraph (d) 
of this section, these amounts shall be included in such final payments.
    (f) If with respect to any academic year the amounts of financial 
assistance hereunder have been ratably reduced as provided in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section and additional funds have not been appropriated 
to pay the full amount of such reductions on or before June 1st of such 
year, the Director of Education shall notify each Community College of 
such fact in writing, and each Community College shall report in writing 
to the Director of Education on or before July 1st of such year the 
amount of unused portion of received funds. The total of such reported 
unused portions of received funds shall be reallocated by the Director 
of Education in proportion to the amount of financial assistance to 
which each Community College is entitled under paragraph (d) but which 
has not been provided due to the ratable reductions provided for 
therein, (except that no Community College shall receive more than the 
total annual cost of the education programs provided by such College) 
and payments shall be made reflecting such reallocations on or before 
August 1st of such academic year.
    (g) If the Director of Education determines that a Community College 
has received, through mistake or fraud, payments of financial assistance 
under this subpart to which it was not entitled, the Director shall 
promptly notify the college, which may appeal the Director's 
determination under the procedures set forth in Sec. 41.7, and adjust 
the amount of payments to the college under this subpart for the same or 
subsequent academic years to compensate for such overpayments or 
otherwise attempt to recover such overpayments.
    (h) Eligibility for grants under this subpart shall not, by itself, 
bar a Community College from qualifying for or receiving financial 
assistance under any other Federal program for which it may qualify.


<R05>
Sec. 41.9  Reports.

    Each Community College receiving financial assistance under this 
subpart shall provide to the Director of Education on or before December 
1st of each year a report which shall include an accounting of the 
amounts and purposes for which such financial assistance was expended 
during the preceding academic year; the annual cost of education 
programs of the Community College from all sources for such academic 
year; and a final report of the performance based upon the criteria set 
forth in the Community College's stated goals, philosophy or plan of 
operation. Upon reasonable cause, the Director of Education may extend 
the period for submitting the annual report. Each Community College 
shall in addition report to the Director of Education its FTE Indian 
student enrollment for each academic term of the academic year within 
three weeks of the date such FTE calculation is made.


<R05>
Sec. 41.10  Technical assistance.

the type and source of technical assistance is specified in the request, 
the Director, to the extent possible or feasible, shall provide the type 
of technical assistance through the source so specified. Technical 
assistance may include, but is not limited to, consulting services for 
the development of programs, plans, and feasibility studies and 
accounting, and other technical advice. In awarding of contracts for 
technical assistance, preference shall be given to an organization 
designated by the Community College to be assisted. Denials of requests 
for technical assistance under this section shall be made in writing and 
sent to the applicant within thirty (30) days of the request, together 
with a statement of the reason for denial. An appeal under this section 
may be undertaken in the same manner as in the case of negative 
determinations of feasibility under Sec. 41.7 of his subpart.

quotient of the sum of credit hours for which all such part-time 
students are registered during such academic term divided by (12)), 
calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion 
of the sixth week of an academic term. The formula for calculating the 
Indian FTE for an academic term is expressed mathematically as 
FTE=FT+PTCR/12 where FT is the number of full time Indian students 
(those carrying 12 or more credit hours at the end of the sixth week of 
the academic term) and PTCR is the number of credit hours for which

grant agreement signed by the Director of Education, incorporating the 
grant application and including the provisions required by Sec. 41.27 of 
this subpart.
    (e) The College shall be eligible to receive a grant for the fiscal 
year beginning October 1, 1979, and for each succeeding year, in an

percent (75%) of the grant amount available for allotment to the College 
for such academic year under paragraph (e) of this section, calculated 
on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion of the 
sixth week of the academic year, less the amount previously advanced for 
such academic year. On or before July 1st (or such other date that is 
the first day of the eleventh month) of such academic year, the balance

of not supplying the information. At a minimum, the notice to the parent 
or eligible student must state:
    (1) The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of 
the President) which authorizes requesting the information and whether 
disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary.
    (2) The principle purpose or purposes for which the information is 
intended to be used.
    (3) The routine uses which may be made of the information.

[[Page 189]]

    (4) The effects, if any, of not providing all or any part of the 
requested information.

the parent or eligible student shall be on the form or on a tear-off 
sheet attached to the form or on a separate sheet, whichever, is most 
practical.
    (f) When information is collected by an interviewer, the interviewer 
shall provide the parent or eligible student with a written notice which 
the individual may retain. If the interview is conducted by telephone, 
however, the interviewer may summarize the notice for the individual and 
need not provide a copy to the individual unless the individual requests 
that a copy be mailed to him.
    (g) A parent or eligible student may be asked to acknowledge, in 
writing, that he has been given the notice required by this section.
    (h) No student records may be maintained describing how any

enforcement activity.


<R05>
Sec. 43.22  Assuring integrity of records.

    (a) Student records shall be maintained with appropriate

threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in 
substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any 
individual on whom information is maintained.
    (b) When maintained in manual form, student records shall be 
maintained, at a minimum, subject to the following safeguards, or 
safeguards giving comparable protection:
    (1) Areas in which the student records are maintained or regularly 
used shall be posted with an appropriate warning, stating that access to 
the records is limited to authorized persons. The warning shall also 
summarize the requirements of Sec. 43.23 and state that employees may be 
subject to a criminal penalty for the unauthorized disclosure of student 
records.
    (2) During working hours, the area in which the student records are 
maintained or regularly used shall be occupied by authorized personnel, 
or access to the student records shall be restricted by their storage in 
locked metal file cabinets or a locked room.
    (3) During nonworking hours, access to the student records shall be 
restricted by their storage in locked metal file cabinets or a locked 
room.
    (4) Where a locked room is the method of security provided for a 
system, the educational institution responsible for the system shall, no 
later than December 31, 1978, supplement that security by:
    (i) Providing lockable file cabinets or containers for the student 
records, or
    (ii) Changing the lock or locks for the room so that they may not be 
opened with a master key. For the purpose of this paragraph, a master is 
a key which may be used to open rooms other than the room containing 
student records, unless those rooms are used by officials or employees 
authorized to have access to the student records.
    (c) When maintained in computerized form, student records shall be 
maintained, at a minimum, subject to safeguards based on those 
recommended in the National Bureau of Standards' booklet, ``Computer 
Security Guidelines for Implementing the Privacy Act of 1974'' (May 30, 
1975), and any supplements to it, which are adequate and appropriate to 
assure the integrity of records in the system.
    (d) The education institution responsible for a system of student 
records shall be responsible for assuring that specific procedures are 
developed to assure that the student records in the system for which it 
is responsible are maintained with security meeting the regulations in 
this section. These procedures shall be in writing and shall be posted 
or otherwise periodically brought to the attention of employees working 
with the student records contained in the system.

[[Page 190]]


<R05>
Sec. 43.23  Conduct of employees.

    (a) Employees whose duties require handling of student records 
shall, at all times, take care to protect the integrity, security, and 
confidentiality of these records.
    (b) No employee of the educational institution may disclose student 
records unless disclosure is permitted under Sec. 43.14 or made to the 
parent of the student or eligible student to whom the record pertains.
    (c) No employee of the educational institution may alter or destroy 
a student record, unless:
    (1) Alteration or destruction is properly undertaken in the course 
of the employee's regular duties, or

administrative decision or the decision of a court of competent 
jurisdiction.

records shall be responsible for assuring that employees with access to 
the system are made aware of the requirements of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 45.14  General entry screening.

    Each school shall participate in a screening program for all newly 
enrolled children and children who have not previously been screened in 
the school. Such screening shall be conducted by the school in order to 
identify those children who should be referred for a full individual 
evaluation. The general entry screening shall consist of the following 
elements, appropriately adapted for use with children of his/her 
particular age. This screening must be completed within thirty (30) days 
of the child's enrollment and include at a minimum:
    (a) An appropriate vision screening;
    (b) An appropriate hearing screening;
    (c) A screening of the child's primary language skills;
    (d) The administration by a classroom teacher of a general screening

every other year, beginning with the first level of enrollment at the 
school. The periodic school screening must meet the requirements set 
forth in Sec. 45.14. Nothing in this part exempts newly enrolled 
students in even numbered grades, kindergarten, or pre-school from being 
screened as required in Sec. 45.14.


<R05>
Sec. 45.16  Screening personnel.

    The school shall utilize personnel who are trained to do the 
specific screening which is being performed.


<R05>

    The school supervisor or designee shall review all results obtained 
through the screening procedures indicated in Secs. 45.14--45.15 with 
the classroom teacher as a team within ten (10) days of completion of 
this screening and determine if an individual evaluation is warranted.
    (a) Upon the determination that an individual evaluation is needed, 
the school supervisor or designee shall within twenty (20) days complete 
the following:
    (1) Inform the parents of the screening results and the 
recommendations of the team.
    (2) Explain parental rights as required in Sec. 45.51 to the 
parents.
    (3) Obtain parental consent to perform an individual evaluation.
    (4) When parental consent for an individual evaluation is obtained a

the Agency Special Education Coordinator in consultation with the school 
supervisor. The referral shall be fowarded to the appropriate personnel 
for action.
    (b) Should parental consent be denied, possible alternatives to 
formal evaluation such as modifications to the regular classroom program 
must be considered and discussed with the parent and classroom teacher 
prior to implementing due process procedures as provided in Sec. 45.58. 
The discussion required in this part must be held within five (5) days 
of formal denial of consent and any modifications agreed upon must be 
implemented within thirty (30) days. If no agreement can be reached 
through these ``conciliation'' measures the due process procedures in 
Sec. 45.58 should be considered.
    (c) Nothing in this part is to be interpreted as prohibiting the 
child's parent, teacher or school administrator from referring a child 
for an individual evaluation should they feel that an evaluation is 
needed regardless of the screening cycle.
    (d) Screening scales completed on children must be kept in the 
child's cumulative file until the succeeding scale is completed. If a 
child is placed in a Special Education Program, the screening results 
will then become a part of the child's handling file. The child, once 
placed, will become exempt from the screening procedures conducted 
thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 45.18  Individual evaluations.

    (a) An individual evaluation must be conducted after receiving 
parental consent when:
    (1) The child is referred based on the screening results, or
    (2) Requested by the parent, teacher or administrator in writing.
    (b) A student must be re-evaluated when:
    (1) A disagreement occurs between the school and parent regarding a 
change of placement from one program to another (i.e., full-time special 
education to regular classroom, part-time special education to regular 
classroom, etc.),
    (2) A change is proposed for the identification of a student's 
handicapping condition to a different condition (i.e., seriously 
emotionally disturbed to specific learning disabled, mentally retarded 
to specific learning disability, etc.),

[[Page 197]]

    (3) A child is currently enrolled in a special education program and 
the last evaluation was administered three years ago, or
    (4) Requested by the parent.


<R05>
Sec. 45.19  Evaluation procedures.

    Procedures for selecting testing and evaluation materials and 
procedures developed for the purpose of evaluation and placement of 
handicapped children will not be racially or culturally discriminatory. 
Materials or procedures shall be provided and administered in the 
child's native (primary) language or mode of communication unless it is 
clearly not feasible to do so. No single procedure shall be the sole 
criterion for determining an appropriate educational program for a 
child. Assessment instruments should be selected on a child-by-child 
basis. Assessments must be reported in such a manner as to indicate 
present levels of the child's performance, to determine the need for 
special education and related services. Based on the individual needs of 
the child, additional specialized assessments may be required. 
Assessment reports should contain a summary of the diagnosis and 
specific educational recommendations for remediation. Assessment of a 
handicapped child will be multi-disciplinary, in order to provide a 
comprehensive view of the child from the perspective of the school, 
home, and community.
    (a) For the purposes of non-discriminatory testing and evaluation 
practices, the following shall apply:
    (1) Assessment instruments shall be appropriately adapted when used 
with children of impaired sensory, physical, or speaking skills and such 
adaptation shall consider each child's age and socio-economic and 
cultural background.
    (2) Specialists implementing evaluation procedures must be familiar 
with local, cultural, language, and social patterns and practices.
    (3) Interpretors, in the native language and/or sign language may be 
used throughout all phases of the evaluation.
    (4) Communication with parents and the child shall be in the native 
language of the home (through the use of an interpretor) unless the 
English language is well understood by the parents, guardians, or child.
    (5) Local community norms shall be considered when norm referenced 
tests are used.
    (6) Criterion referenced instruments should be used.
    (7) Developmental checklist(s) should be used where appropriate.
    (8) Instruments shall be administered only by trained personnel and 
according to the producer's instructions.
    (9) Instruments shall assess specific abilities, not merely produce 
a single IQ score.
    (10) No one result shall determine placement.
    (b) Assessment instruments should be adapted in accordance with the 
producers instructions to meet the individual needs of the child being 
evaluated. This requires that:
    (1) Instruments be adapted according to age, socioeconomic, and 
cultural background of each child before or during a child's evaluation.
    (2) Instruments be adapted for children with perceptual problems 
either before or during an evaluation.
    (c) Evaluation shall be conducted in educationally related areas to 
verify a child's suspected need for special education. Evaluations shall 
be accomplished through coordination with the school supervisor and the 
Agency Special Education Coordinator when appropriate.
    (d) An assessment by a psychologist shall be provided when 
appropriate to the child's needs. Such assessment may include:
    (1) An individually appropriate psychological examination 
culminating in specific recommendations, based upon the child's 
developmental and social history.
    (2) Observation of the child in familiar surroundings, such as a 
classroom or home.
    (3) Inventory of sensory, motor, language, perceptual, attentional, 
cognitive, affective, attitudinal, self-image, interpersonal, 
behavioral, interest and vocational factors, in regard to the child's 
maturity, integrity and interaction with the educational and/or home 
context.

[[Page 198]]

    (e) An assessment by a nurse, social worker, or a counselor shall be 
provided when appropriate for the child. Such assessment of pertinent 
family history and home situation factors shall include:
    (1) A description of pertinent family history and individual 
developmental history and estimates of adaptive behavior at home in the 
neighborhood and in local peer groups.
    (2) Estimates of adaptive behavior shall be based to the greatest 
possible degree on information obtained by direct observation or 
interview of the child and/or parent in the neighborhood setting.
    (f) Each qualified specialist providing an assessment component 
shall give the child a professionally sound, complete and suitable 
individualized examination or assessment in the context of the child's 
physical, developmental, social and educational history and current 
circumstances.
    (g) Individual evaluations shall be conducted on a child unless 
there are written and documented reasons determined on an individual 
basis, for waiving evaluations. Acceptable reasons may include but are 
not limited to circumstances where:
    (1) The parents refuse to permit an evaluation.
    (2) The parents arrange for an equivalent evaluation of their child 
by a qualified professional.
    (3) An equivalent evaluation has been completed within the past 
three (3) years.

to recommend intervention strategies.


<R05>
Sec. 45.21  Formation of multi-disciplinary evaluation teams.

    (a) The school supervisor will be responsible for the overall 
conduct of the individual evaluation and shall collect and review all 
pertinent information regarding the child to be evaluated.
    (b) The Special Education Coordinator shall coordinate through the 
school supervisor, the selection of a multi-disciplinary evaluation team 
for the conduct of the evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 45.22  Composition of multi-disciplinary evaluation teams.

    The multi-disciplinary evaluation team shall be composed of 
qualified persons appropriate to complete an assessment of the suspected 
disability. In all cases the classroom teacher (or other instructional 
staff member) familiar with the child and a person knowledgeable with 
respect to the suspected disability must be included on the team.


<R05>
Sec. 45.23  Content of individual evaluations.

    Each individual evaluation must include:
    (a) An assessment of the child's educational status which includes:
    (1) A history of the child's prior evaluations.
    (2) A statement of the child's attendance pattern to include schools 
attended and average daily attendance in prior years.
    (3) An educational history including:
    (i) The child's academic grades.
    (ii) The child's achievement and aptitude test scores and a 
statement of the child's current academic standing or school readiness.
    (iii) Previous educational strategies used to remediate the child's 
educational need.
    (iv) A statement of the child's social relations with groups, peers, 
and adults based on classroom and teacher observations.
    (v) A description of the child's academic strengths that promote 
learning.
    (vi) A description of the child's physical limitations and behavior 
that inhibit learning.
    (vii) A statement of the child's attentional capacity and 
communication skills.
    (b) A health assessment which includes:
    (1) Present and past medical review.
    (2) Physical examination.

[[Page 199]]

    (3) Current existing medical conditions and prescribed treatment(s).
    (c) An assessment by a psychologist, including an individual 
psychological examination culminating in specific recommendations, as 
contained in Sec. 45.19.
    (d) Children who have a speech impairment as their primary handicap 
may not need a complete battery of assessments (e.g., psychological, 
physical, or adaptive behavior). However, a qualified speech-language 
pathologist will:
    (1) Evaluate each speech impaired child using procedures that are 
appropriate for the diagnosis and appraisal of speech and language 
disorders, and
    (2) Where necessary, make referrals for additional assessments 
needed to make an appropriate placement decision. For example, if a 
child is suspected of being seriously emotionally disturbed, the child 
should be evaluated by either a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist.


<R05>
Sec. 45.24  Test administration.

    Agencies shall insure, at a minimum, that:
    (a) Tests and other evaluation materials:
    (1) Are provided and administered in the child's native language or 
other mode of communication, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so;
    (2) Have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are 
used; and
    (3) Are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the 
instructions provided by their producer;
    (b) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to 
assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are 
designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient;
    (c) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that 
when a test is administered to a child with impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the child's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test 
purports to measure rather than reflecting the child's impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors 
which the test purports to measure);
    (d) No single procedure is used as the sole criterion for 
determining an appropriate educational program for a child;
    (e) The child is assessed in all areas related to the suspected 
disability, including, where appropriate, health, vision, hearing, 
social and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, 
communicative status, and motor abilities;
    (f) Tests, to the greatest extent possible, are free from racial, 
cultural and sexual bias; and
    (g) Determinations of mental retardation are based on an assessment 
of a variety of factors including adaptive behavior and past and current 
development activities (e.g., indices or manifestations of social, 
intellectual, adaptive, verbal, motor, language, emotional and self-care 
development for age).


<R05>
Sec. 45.25  Location of evaluation.

    (a) The evaluation shall take place in the school or at another 
facility which is jointly approved by the child's parents and school 
officials.
    (b) When a child has been referred for an evaluation and, at the 
time of such referral, such child is in a hospital or is otherwise 
living away from home, the Agency shall make appropriate arrangements 
for the provision of the evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 45.26  Multi-disciplinary evaluation team procedures.

    (a) Each individual evaluation must be completed, with full 
attention to its comprehensiveness and thoroughness, within thirty days 
from the date of written parental consent. An extension of time of 
thirty additional days may be approved in writing by the Agency 
Superintendent for Education after written documentation by the school 
that unusual circumstances exist preventing completion of the individual 
evaluation in the specified time. No more than one extension may be 
approved in connection with a single individual evaluation unless 
approved in writing by the Director, or designee.
    (b) The comprehensive assessment must reflect a compilation of 
information drawn from different assessment

[[Page 200]]

sources. The depth of the assessment in each area will vary based on the 
initial review of screening information conducted by the school 
supervisor.
    (c) The Special Education Coordinator is responsible for ensuring 
that full and complete records of information collected or generated in 
connection with an individual evaluation are maintained. A report 
setting forth a full written explanation of the findings and the 
recommendations made by the multi-disciplinary evaluation team must be 
prepared. The report must include:
    (1) A description of the child's present level of functioning;
    (2) A description of the needs of the child in rank order of 
importance;
    (3) A recommendation of the types of services which should be 
provided for each listed need;
    (4) A written summary of the procedures employed, the results, and 
the diagnostic impression;
    (5) A proposed date for the review of the child's progress prior to 
the review required in Sec. 45.38, if such assessment so indicates; and
    (6) Criteria by which at that time, the effectiveness of the child's 
program may be determined.
    (d) Each member of the multi-disciplinary evaluation team shall 
certify in writing whether the report prepared by the team reflects his 
or her conclusions, and if not, shall submit a separate statement 
presenting his or her conclusions. The report must be prepared no later 
than fifteen (15) days after completion of the evaluation.
    (e) Members of the multi-disciplinary evaluation teams must be 
responsible for all aspects of the individual evaluation including: the 
selection; administration and interpretation of evaluation materials; 
the collection of all appropriate social and cultural background and 
adaptive behavior information related to each evaluation; and the 
confidentiality of information collected during the individual 
evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 45.27  Emergency evaluation and placement.

    (a) Where a child demonstrates documented instances of dangerously 
assaultive or self-abusive behavior, the school supervisor may approve a 
temporary change in placement (i.e., to a special education setting 
other than the regular classroom) on an emergency basis. The school 
supervisor shall immediately notify the Special Education Coordinator of 
the placement. The Agency shall no later than the following day 
determine the appropriateness of the placement and initiate the 
evaluation process.
    (b) The parent shall be informed immediately of the child's behavior 
and shall participate (if possible within the constraints of time) in 
the emergency placement decision and consent for evaluation will be 
obtained.
    (c) An individual evaluation must be completed within fifteen days 
of the emergency placement. Procedures as outlined in Sec. 45.23 must be 
followed. A final placement determination, made by the IEP committee, 
must be made within five (5) days following completion of the individual 
evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 45.28  Independent educational evaluation.

    (a) The parents of a handicapped child have the right under this 
part to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the child, 
subject to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Each school/
Agency shall provide to parents, on request, information about where an 
independent educational evaluation may be obtained.
    (b) A parent has the right to an independent education evaluation at 
public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by 
the school or Agency. However, the school or Agency may initiate a 
hearing in accordance with the procedures of this part to show that its 
evaluation is appropriate. If the final decision is that the evaluation 
is appropriate, the parent still has the right to an independent 
educational evaluation, but not at school expense.
    (c) If the parent obtains an independent educational evaluation at 
private expense, the results of the evaluation:
    (1) Must be considered by the school in any decision made with 
respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education to the 
child; and
    (2) May be presented as evidence at a hearing regarding that child.

[[Page 201]]

    (d) If a hearing officer requests an independent educational 
evaluation as part of a hearing, the cost of the evaluation must be at 
school or Agency expense.
    (e) Whenever an independent evaluation is at school or Agency 
expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including 
the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, 
must be the same as the criteria which the school or Agency uses when it 
initiates an evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 45.29  Additional procedures for evaluating specific learning disabilities.

    (a) In evaluating a child suspected of having a specific learning 
disability, in addition to the requirements of Sec. 45.22, each Agency 
shall include on the multi-disciplinary evaluation team:
    (1) The child's regular teacher; or
    (2) If the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular 
classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age; or
    (3) For a child of less than school age, an individual qualified to 
teach a child of his or her age; and
    (4) At least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic 
examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language 
pathologist, or remedial reading teacher.
    (b) At least one team member other than the child's regular teacher 
shall observe the child's academic performance in the regular classroom 
setting. (In the case of a child of less than school age or out of 
school, a team member shall observe the child in an environment 
appropriate for a child of that age.)
    (c) The team may determine that a child has a specific learning 
disability if:
    (1) The child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and 
ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, when provided with learning experiences appropriate for 
the child's age and ability levels; and
    (2) The team finds that a child has a severe discrepancy between 
achievement and intellectual ability in one or more of the following 
areas:
    (i) Oral expression;
    (ii) Listening comprehension;
    (iii) Written expression;
    (iv) Basic reading skill;
    (v) Reading comprehension;
    (vi) Mathematics calculation; or
    (vii) Mathematics reasoning.
    (d) The multi-disciplinary team may not identify a child as having a 
specific learning disability if the severe discrepancy between ability 
and achievement is primarily the result of:
    (1) A visual, hearing, or motor handicap;
    (2) Mental retardation;
    (3) Emotional disturbance; or
    (4) Environmental, cultural or economic disadvantage.
    (e) The multi-disciplinary team shall prepare a written report of 
the results of the evaluation. The report must include a statement of:
    (1) Whether the child has a specific learning disability;
    (2) The basis for making the determination;
    (3) The relevant behavior noted during the observation of the child;
    (4) The relationship of that behavior to the child's academic 
functioning;
    (5) The educationally relevant medical findings, if any;
    (6) Whether there is a severe discrepancy between achievement and 
ability which is not correctable without special education and related 
services; and
    (7) The determination of the team concerning the effects of 
environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.
    (f) Each team member shall certify in writing whether the report 
reflects his or her conclusion. If it does not reflect his or her 
conclusion, the team member must submit a separate statement presenting 
his or her conclusions. The report must be prepared no later than 
fifteen (15) days after completion of the evaluation.


<R04>
     Subpart C--Provision of Special Education and Related Services


<R05>
Sec. 45.30  Free appropriate public education.

    (a) Each BIA funded or operated school must ensure that a free 
appropriate public education is provided to every handicapped Indian 
child enrolled in the school between the ages of five (5) and twenty-one 
(21) years.

[[Page 202]]

    (b) An appropriate education is one which meets the needs of a 
handicapped child as set forth in the individual education program in 
the least restrictive educational setting. An appropriate education 
involves the provision of regular education, special education and 
related aids or services and may include pre-school, elementary school, 
or secondary school education.
    (c) The provision of a free education is the provision of 
educational and related services without cost to the child (or parents), 
except for those fees that are imposed on a non-handicapped child, and 
may consist of the provision of free services or the payment of the 
costs of the program. Transportation must be provided in order to assure 
access of persons to services.


<R05>
Sec. 45.31  Individualized education program (IEP).

    If, as a result of the determination of a multi-disciplinary team, a 
child is diagnosed as being handicapped and in need of special education 
and related services, schools are required to develop an IEP within 
thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the written individual 
evaluation report. The IEP shall set forth the approach which will be 
taken to ensure that the child will be provided a free, appropriate 
education.


<R05>
Sec. 45.32  Content of individualized education program (IEP).

    At a minimum, the IEP must contain:
    (a) A statement of the child's present levels of educational 
performance;
    (b) A statement of annual goals, including short term instructional 
objectives;
    (c) A statement of the specific special education and related 
services to be provided to the child, and the extent to which the child 
will be able to participate in regular education programs;
    (d) The projected dates for initiation of services and the 
anticipated duration of the services;
    (e) Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and 
schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the 
short term instructional objectives are being achieved;
    (f) A description of the nature and duration of physical education 
services to be provided to the child; and
    (g) A statement that all services recommended by the multi-
disciplinary team are being provided, or if all recommended services are 
not provided, a justification for the exclusion of the services.


<R05>
Sec. 45.33  Individualized education program (IEP) development.

    (a) Overall responsibility for the development of each IEP rests 
with the school supervisor.
    (b) The IEP shall be developed by a committee which shall hold at 
least one meeting and includes among its members the following:
    (1) The School Supervisor, or designee (who shall chair the 
committee) other than the child's teacher, who is qualified to provide 
or supervise the provision of special education;
    (2) The child's teacher and/or other relevant instructional staff;
    (3) One or both of the child's parents;
    (4) The child, where appropriate; and
    (5) Other individuals at the discretion of the parent, Agency, or 
school.
    (c) For a handicapped child who has been evaluated for the first 
time, the Agency shall insure:
    (1) That a member of the evaluation team participates in the 
meeting; or
    (2) That the representative of the school, the child's teacher, or 
some other person is present at the meeting, who is knowledgeable about 
the evaluation procedures used with the child and is familiar with the 
results of the evaluation.
    (d) Upon receiving written application from the school, the Agency 
Superintendent for Education may allow the school to postpone the 
development of an initial IEP to the beginning of a new school year, if 
the written evaluation report is completed within fifteen (15) days of 
the end of the current school year and, if the Agency Superintendent for 
Education determines that an IEP need not be implemented during the 
summer.
    (e) Schools must prepare a progress report related to the 
instructional objectives specified in the IEP for each handicapped child 
and must include it with, or in lieu of the grading report

[[Page 203]]

prepared by the school for all elementary and secondary students.


<R05>
Sec. 45.34  Placement recommendation in the IEP.

    (a) Placement recommendations shall be made by the School Supervisor 
or designee in concert with the IEP committee and shall be incorporated 
in the IEP.
    (b) The appropriate placement must be selected from the following:
    (1) The regular classroom;
    (2) The regular classroom with consultation;
    (3) The regular classroom with resource teacher;
    (4) The regular classroom with itinerant resource teacher;
    (5) The regular classroom in conjunction with a resource room;
    (6) A self-contained special classroom with part-time instruction in 
regular class;
    (7) A self-contained special class (regular campus);
    (8) A self-contained special class in a special day facility;
    (9) Homebound instruction; and
    (10) Instruction in hospitals and residential facilities.
    (c) Schools may not decline to propose placement for a child or 
recommend to parents that a child be enrolled ``voluntarily'' in a non-
BIA operated/funded school program. In selecting from the continuum of 
alternative settings, no handicapped child may be proposed for placement 
in any alternative settings unless it can be demonstrated that the 
nature or severity of the child's disability is such that education in 
regular class (in the school the child attends if not handicapped) with 
the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved 
satisfactorily. Each school must insure that a continuum of alternative 
placements which meets the particular needs of each enrolled handicapped 
child is available.
    (d) Placement of a handicapped child in a boarding school operated 
by the Bureau which concurrently enrolls non-handicapped children of the 
same age and grade shall be considered a placement in a regular school 
campus.
    (e) Alternative placements may be provided directly by the school, 
or through cooperative arrangements with local and state education 
agencies or, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, 
through contractual arrangements with approved non-public schools, 
agencies or institutions.
    (f) Alternative (9), homebound instruction may be selected only when 
the handicapped child:
    (1) Currently possesses a physical impairment or illness which 
directly (or because of treatment required) precludes the movement of 
the child from a hospital or home environment to the general education 
environment; or
    (2) Has been determined (after an individual evaluation) to require 
a program of continuous mental health care and treatment which would be 
seriously disrupted by movement to the general educational environment. 
The proposed homebound instruction should permit the return of the child 
to the general education environment at a specified date. The Agency 
Superintendent for Education must be immediately notified in writing of 
each homebound placement made by the school.
    (g) Alternative placement (10) may be selected only when the health 
or safety of the child precludes the child's attendance at a nearby 
school for special education services.
    (h) Alternative placements (1) through (8) may not be provided 
through contractual arrangements with approved non-BIA operated/funded 
schools, Agencies or institutions if there are a sufficient number of 
handicapped children with similar educational needs who live within the 
attendance area served by the school to justify the allocation of one 
teacher.
    (i) Handicapped individuals who do not meet the age requirements of 
the Bureau may be served by the local school, provided they are not 
counted for ISEP formula funding, with the approval of the local school 
board and the Agency Superintendent for Education, and so long as such 
placement does not dilute the quality and/or quantity of services 
provided to eligible handicapped students.
    (j) If the multi-disciplinary team determines that a residential 
placement for a child is appropriate they should notify the Agency 
Special Education

[[Page 204]]

Coordinator in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Special 
Education Coordinator, with the approval of the Agency Superintendent 
for Education, will consult with the Education Specialist for 
institutional placement to determine that the placement is in compliance 
with Federal laws regarding the education of handicapped children.


<R05>
Sec. 45.35  Approval of IEP and placement recommendation.

    (a) The school must attempt to schedule a meeting which includes the 
school supervisor or designee, the child's parent(s), and the receiving 
teacher and others as identified in Sec. 45.33.
    (b) The parent(s) of the child must be provided full and effective 
written notice of the meeting and all reasonable efforts must be made by 
the school supervisor to ensure parental participation. The written 
notice to parents shall also contain the following information:
    (1) A statement that the evaluation has been completed and that the 
parents have the right to meet with the School Supervisor, the Special 
Education Coordinator or any member of the IEP committee to discuss and 
plan the IEP.
    (2) A statement that all papers relevant to the evaluation, 
including the actual written assessments, are available for inspection 
by the parents or a designated representative of the parents;
    (3) A statement that the parent has a right to an independent 
evaluation as provided in Sec. 45.28;
    (4) A statement of the parent's options under paragraph (c) of this 
section and a form for indicating the option selected by the parent; and
    (5) A statement explaining the consequences of the parent's 
rejection of the proposed IEP under the due process procedures 
established by Sec. 45.58.
    (c) The parent of a child, upon receipt of full and effective 
notice, may exercise any of the following options (by giving written 
notice to the school):
    (1) To accept or reject a written evaluation finding that the child 
does not need special education;
    (2) To accept or reject the IEP. A parent may accept an IEP in whole 
or in part and the school shall immediately implement the mutually 
accepted elements of the IEP;
    (3) To accept a modified IEP that has been mutually agreed upon with 
the School Supervisor or designee following the meeting described in 
paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (4) To postpone a decision on the IEP until the completion of an 
independent evaluation; and
    (5) To obtain an independent evaluation of their child.
    (d) This meeting may be the first and only full meeting of the IEP 
committee. The meeting must include a thorough discussion of the results 
of the child's individual evaluation, the child's proposed IEP and the 
child's proposed educational placement. The school supervisor or 
designee should take whatever action is necessary to insure that the 
parents understand the proposed IEP and the proposed educational 
placement before requesting consent for placement. At the close of the 
final meeting, each member of the committee shall sign the completed IEP 
to signify their participation and agreement with the educational plan.


<R05>
Sec. 45.36  Parent participation.

    (a) Each school shall take steps to encourage that one or both of 
the parents of the handicapped child are present at each meeting 
including:
    (1) Try to schedule the meeting at a mutually agreed upon time and 
place.
    (2) Notifying parents of the meeting early enough to insure that 
they will have an opportunity to attend.
    (b) The notice under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must indicate 
the purpose, time, and location of the meeting, and who will be in 
attendance.
    (c) If neither parent can attend, the school shall use other methods 
to insure parent participation, including individual or conference 
telephone calls.
    (d) A meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the 
school is unable to convince the parents that they should attend. In 
this case the school must have a record of its attempts to arrange a 
mutually agreed on time and place such as:

[[Page 205]]

    (1) Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the 
results of those calls;
    (2) Copies of correspondence sent to the parents and any responses 
received; and
    (3) Detailed records of visits made to the parent's home or place of 
employment and the results of those visits.

language is other than English.
    (f) The school shall give the parent a copy of the IEP.


<R05>
Sec. 45.37  IEP implementation and placement.

    (a) For newly identified children, the IEP must be implemented and 
educational placement must be made:
    (1) Within thirty (30) days after the written parental approval of 
the placement has been received; or
    (2) In cases involving due process, placement will be made within 
thirty (30) days of the final written decision of the hearing officer, 
unless an appeal is filed by the aggrieved party.
    (b) If the school cannot, within thirty (30) days, provide any or 
all of the services called for in the IEP the School Supervisor must 
consult the Agency Superintendent for Education on alternate means of 
providing the services to fully implement the IEP. The Agency 
Superintendent for Education must make provision for the service within 
fourteen (14) days of the consultation.


<R05>
Sec. 45.38  IEP revision, review of placement.

    Consistent with the requirements of Sec. 45.37, the IEP must be 
reviewed and updated annually. The review and revision of the IEP must 
be completed no later than the first day of school of the next full 
term. Whenever possible, the review shall be scheduled near the time 
that there may be a change in the personnel providing the major services 
to the child under the IEP, as when the child is to move from one grade 
or school to another. The review shall be conducted as follows:
    (a) The school supervisor, the parents, and the person(s) providing 
the major services to the child under the IEP shall meet and make a 
careful review of the child's progress based upon the progress reports 
submitted by the school during the grading period, and the observations 
of those working with the child.
    (b) The School Supervisor shall invite (in writing) the child's 
parents and, where appropriate, the child, to attend and participate in 
the review meeting. The School Supervisor or the parents may, at their 
discretion, invite other person(s) who have worked with, are working 
with, or will be working with the child to attend the review meeting.
    (c) The participants in the review meeting shall determine:
    (1) Whether the child has achieved the goals set forth in the IEP;
    (2) Whether the child has met the criteria which indicate readiness 
to enter a less restrictive program;
    (3) Whether the program the child is in should be specifically 
modified to make it more suitable to the child's needs; and
    (4) Whether it is desirable to refer the child for an individual re-
evaluation.
    (d) The participants in the review meeting shall review the current 
IEP and revise it as appropriate in accordance with Sec. 45.34. If a re-
evaluation of the child is scheduled in accordance with Sec. 45.39, the 
revision of the new IEP shall be deferred until completion of the re-
evaluation. If the parent is unable to attend the review meeting, the 
school shall provide the parent with copies of all relevant documents 
within five (5) days after the review meeting has been completed.
    (e) During the annual review, the description of current educational 
performance in the IEP must be updated and the overall educational 
needs, long-term educational goals, short-term objectives, and related 
services modifications made. Schools are required to rewrite sections of 
the IEP only to the extent necessary to update or modify the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 45.39  Re-evaluation.

    Parental approval is not required for the conduct of a re-evaluation 
if the

[[Page 206]]

child has been initially placed and his/her individualized education 
program has been reviewed following the requirements of this part. 
Notice of the conduct of the re-evaluation must be provided to the 
parent prior to re-evaluation. A written summary of the re-evaluation 
must be provided to the parents within five (5) days of the scheduled 
review meeting. A child must be re-evaluated at least every three (3) 
years.


<R05>
Sec. 45.40  Extended school year services.

    (a) The IEP may provide for continuous instruction (uninterrupted by 
the regular summer recess) whenever:
    (1) Continuous instruction is likely to be necessary in order to 
sustain, with only minor regression, current important educational 
skills and information retention; or
    (2) The child lives in a residential facility or institution.
    (b) The extension of an IEP for a ten (10) to twelve (12) month 
instructional program shall not result in a more restrictive change in 
placement on the continuum of alternative placements nor shall it 
constitute a basis for any deviation from any other educational 
placement requirement of Sec. 45.34 of this part. However, the increased 
isolation of handicapped children which could result from the operation 
of an instructional program for handicapped children during a period of 
time when non-handicapped children are not attending school would not 
violate any requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 45.41  Outcome goals.

    IEP's for children over the age of fifteen (15) years may contain, 
as appropriate, either a description of regular and/or special education 
instructional services leading to the attainment of a regular high 
school diploma before the age of twenty-two or a program of regular or 
special vocational education leading to participation in a work-
experience (or sheltered employment) program and the attainment of an 
appropriate level of vocational proficiency to permit, whenever 
possible, the child's entry into competitive employment upon or before 
reaching the age of twenty-two.


<R05>
Sec. 45.42  Related services.

    The school must ensure that each handicapped child has 
developmental, corrective and other supportive services (to the maximum 
extent feasible) to benefit from special education.


<R05>

    (a) Non-academic and extracurricular services and activities must be 
offered in a way which allows equal opportunity for handicapped children 
to participate in services and activities.

periods must be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to 
the needs of the child.


<R05>
Sec. 45.44  Physical education and athletics.

    (a) Handicapped children must be provided an equal opportunity for 
participation in physical education courses and inter-scholastic, club 
or intramural athletics sponsored by the school.

children in the regular physical education program and may not be 
different from those provided other children, unless:
    (1) The child is enrolled full time in a separate facility or needs 
specially designed physical education; and
    (2) A separate physical education setting is the least restrictive 
environment.


<R05>
Sec. 45.45  Expulsion/suspension.

    A handicapped child may not be expelled or suspended from school if 
the behavior for which action is being taken is related to the child's 
disability. If the child's behavior is so disruptive that the education 
of others is impaired, a review of the child's IEP and placement as 
described in Sec. 45.38 of this part must be undertaken in order to meet 
the needs of the child.


<R05>
Sec. 45.46  Geographic accessibility.

inconsistent with this requirement to the extent that similarly situated 
non-handicapped students are also placed in such a school.


<R05>
Sec. 45.47  Architectural barriers and program accessibility.

    (a) Facilities used by schools, directly, or through contractual 
arrangement, must be accessible to and usable by handicapped children. 
The accessibility standards of the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI A117.1-1961 (R 1971)) shall be followed. Schools located in 
isolated locations may make application to the Director for an annual 
waiver of any standard. Such a request must be based on documented 
inability to meet the standards. In no event may architectural barriers 
prevent a handicapped child from being educated in the least restrictive 
educational environment as defined in Sec. 45.34.
    (b) Program accessibility (i.e., where each program or activity, 
when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to handicapped 
children) must be ensured in all existing facilities.
    (c) Program accessibility may be accomplished through the following 
methods:
    (1) Redesign of equipment;
    (2) Reassignment of classes or other services to accessible 
building;
    (3) Assignment of aides to children;
    (4) Home visits;
    (5) Alteration of existing facilities; or
    (6) Other methods.
    (d) The method for accomplishing program accessibility which offers 
programs and activities to children in the least restrictive 
environment.

    (b) A parental request to inspect and review records must be honored 
without unnecessary delay and before any meeting regarding an IEP or 
hearing relating to the identification, evaluation, or placement of the 
child, and in no case more than fourteen (14) days after the request has

the contested portion of the record is disclosed to any party, the 
parent's explanation must also be disclosed.
    (c) The parent shall be presumed to have authority to inspect and

is inaccurate or misleading or violates the privacy or other rights of 
the child, may request that the information be amended. The school or 
Agency must decide whether to amend the information as requested within 
fourteen (14) days of receipt of request. If the school or Agency

<R05>
Sec. 45.56  Surrogate parents.

    (a) After documented, repeated and reasonable efforts to identify

[[Page 210]]

need for a surrogate parent and, if need is found, for the appointment 
of a surrogate parent.

Education Programs;
    (2) Have knowledge and skills that insure adequate representation of 
the child; and
    (3) Wherever possible, be a member of the child's extended family, 
or if that is not possible, a member of the same tribe as the child.

<R05>
Sec. 45.57  Conciliation/mediation.

    (a) The school must make all reasonable efforts consistent with its 
obligations under this part, to resolve informally any ongoing disputes 
between the parent and the school.
    (b) Prior to the initiation of a due process hearing, the Bureau 
shall attempt to intervene with the mediation process. The following is 
a statement which describes this technique.
    (1) Mediation is a dispute resolution process which is non-
adversarial in nature. It seeks not to declare winners or losers, but to 
find reconciliation between disputing parties. This process is conducted 
through the skills of a trained mediator. Its focus is the mutually 
satisfactory resolution of disputes. No third party acts as judge or 
jury. The parties themselves arrive at an assessment through the 
process. Mediation can be initiated by either a parent or the Bureau in 
order to resolve informally a disagreement with respect to the 
identification, evaluation, or educational placement of, or the free 
appropriate education provided to an Indian child. Mediation shall 
consist of, but not be limited to, an informal discussion of the 
differences between the parties in an effort to resolve those 
differences. The parents and the appropriate school officials may attend 
mediation sessions between the parties in an effort to resolve those 
differences.
    (2) Mediation must be conducted, attempted, or refused in writing by 
concerned parties of the handicapped child whose education is at issue 
before a request for, or initiation of, a hearing authorized by this 
part. Any request by the Bureau for a hearing shall state in writing how 
this requirement has been satisfied. No stigma may be attached to the 
refusal of the concerned parties to mediate or to an unsuccessful 
attempt to mediate. Mediation may not be used to deny or delay a 
parent's right to impartial due process hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 45.58  Initiation of hearings.

    (a) If the parent disagrees with any action taken by a school for 
which full and effective notice to parents is required by this part, a 
hearing may be initiated by the parent of a handicapped child or a child 
suspected of being a handicapped child, by sending a written request for 
hearing to the Agency Superintendent for Education. The Agency 
Superintendent for Education must acknowledge receipt of the written 
request within five (5) days of actual receipt.
    (b) Hearings may be initiated by a school by providing full and 
effective notice to parents in any instance where, after reasonable 
efforts at conciliation, a parent either fails to provide written 
approval of a proposed action, or provides a formal disapproval.
    (c) Whenever a hearing is initiated, full and effective notice of 
the initiation of the hearing must be provided by the hearing officer to 
all persons concerned.

that the person so proposed is not impartial and may exercise one 
automatic disqualification during the appointment process. The Director 
shall resolve all challenges for cause (i.e., partiality).
    (d) If the proposed hearing officer is automatically disqualified or 
found to be not impartial by the Director, the Agency Superintendent for 
Education must within three (3) days designate another person.
    (e) Final appointment of a hearing officer occurs whenever a 
proposed hearing officer is selected by the Agency Superintendent for 
Education and the parent or the school fails to notify the Agency 
Superintendent for Education of a decision to challenge the impartiality 
of the proposed hearing officer or of a decision to automatically 
disqualify the proposed hearing officer (available only once for each 
party), or when the Director determines that no doubt exists as to the

would conflict with his or her objectivity in the hearing.
    (b) A person who otherwise qualifies to conduct a hearing under

person, one notice of eligibility or adverse action may be addressed to 
the person who filed the applications. However, the notice must list the 
name of each person involved. Where an individual is represented by a

acknowledgment of receipt form to be completed by the addressee and 
returned to the Director or Superintendent. If the acknowledgment of 
receipt is not returned, computation of the appeal period shall begin on 
the date the notice was remailed. Certified or registered notices 
returned for any reason other than ``Unclaimed'' need not be remailed.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a notice 
of adverse action is considered to have been made and computation of the

    (2) Of acknowledgment of receipt;
    (3) Of personal delivery; or
    (4) Of the return by the post office of an undelivered certified or 
registered letter.
    (e) In all cases where an applicant is represented by an attorney, 
the attorney shall be recognized as fully controlling the application on 
behalf of the applicant and service on the attorney of any document 
relating to the application shall be considered to be service on the 
applicant. Where an applicant is represented by more than one attorney, 
service upon one of the attorneys shall be sufficient.
    (f) To avoid hardship or gross injustice, the Director or 
Superintendent may waive technical deficiencies in applications or other 
submissions. Failure to file by the deadline does not constitute a 
technical deficiency.

to support tribally operated programs to protect Indian children and 
reduce the incidents of family violence in Indian country as authorized 
by the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act of

<R05>
Sec. 63.2  Policy.

    In enacting the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence 
Prevention Act, the Congress recognized there is no resource more vital 
to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their 
children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, 
in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for 
membership in, an Indian tribe. The minimum standards of character and 
suitability of employment for individuals ensure that Indian children 
are protected, and the Indian child protection and family violence 
prevention programs will emphasize the unique values of Indian culture 
and community involvement in the prevention and treatment of child 
abuse, child neglect and family violence.

<R04>
Subpart B--Minimum Standards of Character and Suitability for Employment


<R05>
Sec. 63.10  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish:
    (a) Procedures for determining suitability for employment and 
efficiency of service as mandated by the Indian Child Protection and 
Family Violence Prevention Act; and
    (b) Minimum standards of character to ensure that individuals having 
regular contact with or control over Indian children have not been 
convicted of certain types of crimes or acted in a manner that placed 
others at risk or raised questions about their trustworthiness.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11  What is a determination of suitability for employment and efficiency of service?

    (a) Determinations of suitability measure the fitness or eligibility 
of an applicant, volunteer, or employee for a particular position. 
Suitability for employment does not evaluate an applicant's education, 
skills, knowledge, experience, etc. Rather, it requires that the 
employer investigate the background of each applicant, volunteer, and 
employee to:
    (1) Determine the degree of risk the applicant, volunteer, or 
employee brings to the position; and
    (2) Certify that the applicant's, volunteer's, or employee's past 
conduct would not interfere with his/her performance of duties, nor 
would it create an immediate or long-term risk for any Indian child.
    (b) Efficiency of service is the employer's verification that the 
applicant or employee is able to perform the duties and responsibilities 
of the position, and his/her presence on the job will not inhibit other 
employees or the agency from performing their functions.


<R05>
Sec. 63.12   What are minimum standards of character?

    Minimum standards of character are established by an employer and 
refer to identifiable character traits and past conduct. An employer may 
use character traits and past conduct to determine whether an applicant, 
volunteer, or employee can effectively perform the duties of a 
particular position without risk of harm to others. Minimum standards of 
character ensure that no applicant, volunteer, or employee will be 
placed in a position with regular contact with or control over Indian 
children if he/she has been found guilty of or entered a plea of nolo 
contendere or guilty to any offense under Federal, state, or tribal law 
involving crimes of violence, sexual assault, sexual molestation, sexual 
exploitation, sexual contact or prostitution, or crimes against persons.


<R05>

Sec. 63.13   What does the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act require of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian tribes or tribal 
          organizations receiving funds under the Indian Self-
          Determination and Education Assistance Act or the Tribally 
          Controlled Schools Act?

    (a) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must compile a list of all 
authorized positions which involve regular contact with or control over 
Indian children; investigate the character of each individual who is 
employed, or is being considered for employment; and, prescribe minimum 
standards of character which each individual must meet to be appointed 
to such positions.
    (b) All Indian tribes or tribal organizations receiving funds under 
the authority of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act or the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 must conduct a 
background investigation for individuals whose duties and 
responsibilities would allow them regular contact with or control over 
Indian

[[Page 233]]

children, and employ only individuals who meet standards of character 
that are no less stringent than those prescribed for the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 63.14   What positions require a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment or retention?

    All positions that allow an applicant, employee, or volunteer 
regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a 
background investigation and determination of suitability for 
employment.


<R05>
Sec. 63.15   What questions should an employer ask?

    Employment applications must:
    (a) Ask whether the applicant, volunteer, or employee has been 
arrested or convicted of a crime involving a child, violence, sexual 
assault, sexual molestation, sexual exploitation, sexual contact or 
prostitution, or crimes against persons;
    (b) Ask the disposition of the arrest or charge;
    (c) Require that an applicant, volunteer or employee sign, under 
penalty of perjury, a statement verifying the truth of all information 
provided in the employment application; and
    (d) Inform the applicant, volunteer or employee that a criminal 
history record check is a condition of employment and require the 
applicant, volunteer or employee to consent, in writing, to a record 
check.


<R05>
Sec. 63.16   Who conducts the background investigation and prepares the determination of suitability for employment?

    (a) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must use the United States Office 
of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct background investigations for 
Federal employees. The BIA must designate qualified security personnel 
to adjudicate the results of background investigations.
    (b) Indian tribes and tribal organizations may conduct their own 
background investigations, contract with private firms, or request the 
OPM to conduct an investigation. The investigation should cover the past 
five years of the individual's employment, education, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 63.17  How does an employer determine suitability for employment and efficiency of service?

    (a) Adjudication is the process employers use to determine 
suitability for employment and efficiency of service. The adjudication 
process protects the interests of the employer and the rights of 
applicants and employees. Adjudication requires uniform evaluation to 
ensure fair and consistent judgment.
    (b) Each case is judged on its own merits. All available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, must be considered and 
assessed in terms of accuracy, completeness, relevance, seriousness, 
overall significance, and how similar cases have been handled in the 
past.
    (c) An adjudicating official conducts the adjudication. Each Federal 
agency, Indian tribe, or tribal organization must appoint an 
adjudicating official, who must first have been the subject of a 
favorable background investigation.
    (1) Indian tribes and tribal organizations must ensure that persons 
charged with the responsibility for adjudicating employee background 
investigations are well-qualified and trained.
    (2) Indian tribes and tribal organizations should also ensure that 
individuals who are not trained to adjudicate these types of 
investigations are supervised by someone who is experienced and receive 
the training necessary to perform the task.
    (d) Each adjudicating official must be thoroughly familiar with all 
laws, regulations, and criteria involved in making a determination for 
suitability.
    (e) The adjudicating official must review the background 
investigation to determine the character, reputation, and 
trustworthiness of the individual. At a minimum, the adjudicating 
official must:
    (1) Review each security investigation form and employment 
application and compare the information provided;
    (2) Review the results of written record searches requested from 
local law enforcement agencies, former employers, former supervisors, 
employment references, and schools; and

[[Page 234]]

    (3) Review the results of the fingerprint charts maintained by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation or other law enforcement information 
maintained by other agencies.
    (f) Relevancy is a key objective in evaluating investigative data. 
The adjudicating official must consider prior conduct in light of:
    (1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct in question;
    (2) The recency and circumstances surrounding the conduct in 
question;
    (3) The age of the individual at the time of the incident;
    (4) Societal conditions that may have contributed to the nature of 
the conduct;
    (5) The probability that the individual will continue the type of 
behavior in question; and,
    (6) The individual's commitment to rehabilitation and a change in 
the behavior in question.


<R05>
Sec. 63.18   Are the requirements for Bureau of Indian Affairs adjudication different from the requirements for Indian tribes and tribal organizations?

    Yes.
    (a) In addition to the minimum requirements for background 
investigations found in Sec. 63.12, Bureau of Indian Affairs' 
adjudicating officials must review the OPM National Agency Check and 
Inquiries which includes a search of the OPM Security/Suitability 
Investigations Index (SII) and the Defense Clearance and Investigations 
Index (DCII), and any additional standards which may be established by 
the BIA.
    (b) All Bureau of Indian Affairs employees who have regular contact 
with or control over Indian children must be reinvestigated every five 
years during their employment in that or any other position which allows 
regular contact with or control over Indian children.
    (c) Indian tribes and tribal organizations may adopt these 
additional requirements but are not mandated to do so by law.


<R05>
Sec. 63.19   When should an employer deny employment or dismiss an employee?

    (a) An employer may deny employment or dismiss an employee when an 
individual has been found guilty of or entered a plea of guilty or nolo 
contendere to any Federal, state or tribal offense involving a crime of 
violence, sexual assault, sexual molestation, child exploitation, sexual 
contact, prostitution, or crimes against persons.
    (b) An employer may deny employment or dismiss an employee when an 
individual has been convicted of an offense involving a child victim, a 
sex crime, or a drug felony.


<R05>
Sec. 63.20   What should an employer do if an individual has been charged with an offense but the charge is pending or no disposition has been made by a court?

    (a) The employer may deny the applicant employment until the charge 
has been resolved.
    (b) The employer may deny the employee any on-the-job contact with 
children until the charge is resolved.
    (c) The employer may detail or reassign the employee to other duties 
that do not involve contact with children.
    (d) The employer may place the employee on administrative leave 
until the court has disposed of the charge.


<R05>
Sec. 63.21   Are there other factors that may disqualify an applicant, volunteer or employee from placement in a position which involves regular contact with or 
          control over Indian children?

    Yes.
    (a) An applicant, volunteer, or employee may be disqualified from 
consideration or continuing employment if it is found that:
    (1) The individual's misconduct or negligence interfered with or 
affected a current or prior employer's performance of duties and 
responsibilities.
    (2) The individual's criminal or dishonest conduct affected the 
individual's performance or the performance of others.
    (3) The individual made an intentional false statement, deception or 
fraud on an examination or in obtaining employment.
    (4) The individual has refused to furnish testimony or cooperate 
with an investigation.
    (5) The individual's alcohol or substance abuse is of a nature and 
duration that suggests the individual could not perform the duties of 
the position

[[Page 235]]

or would directly threaten the property or safety of others.
    (6) The individual has illegally used narcotics, drugs, or other 
controlled substances without evidence of substantial rehabilitation.
    (7) The individual knowingly and willfully engaged in an act or 
activities designed to disrupt government programs.
    (b) An individual must be disqualified for Federal employment if any 
statutory or regulatory provision would prevent his/her lawful 
employment.


<R05>
Sec. 63.22   Can an employer certify an individual with a prior conviction or substantiated misconduct as suitable for employment?

    (a) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must use Federal adjudicative 
standards which allow the BIA to certify that an individual is suitable 
for employment in a position that does not involve regular contact with 
or control over Indian children. The adjudicating officer must determine 
that the individual's prior conduct will not interfere with the 
performance of duties and will not create a potential for risk to the 
safety and well-being of Indian children.
    (b) Indian tribes and tribal organizations must identify those 
positions which permit contact with or control over Indian children and 
establish standards to determine suitability for employment. Those 
standards should then be used to determine whether an individual is 
suitable for employment in a position that permits contact with or 
control over Indian children. If not, the individual may only be placed 
in a position that does not permit contact with or control over Indian 
children.


<R05>
Sec. 63.23   What rights does an applicant, volunteer or employee have during this process?

    (a) The applicant, volunteer, or employee must be provided an 
opportunity to explain, deny, or refute unfavorable and incorrect 
information gathered in an investigation, before the adjudication is 
final. The applicant, volunteer, or employee should receive a written 
summary of all derogatory information and be informed of the process for 
explaining, denying, or refuting unfavorable information.
    (b) Employers and adjudicating officials must not release the actual 
background investigative report to an applicant, volunteer, or employee. 
However, they may issue a written summary of the derogatory information.
    (c) The applicant, volunteer, or employee who is the subject of a 
background investigation may obtain a copy of the reports from the 
originating (Federal, state, or other tribal) agency and challenge the 
accuracy and completeness of any information maintained by that agency.
    (d) The results of an investigation cannot be used for any purpose 
other than to determine suitability for employment in a position that 
involves regular contact with or control over Indian children.
    (e) Investigative reports contain information of a highly personal 
nature and should be maintained confidentially and secured in locked 
files. Investigative reports should be seen only by those officials who 
in performing their official duties need to know the information 
contained in the report.


<R05>
Sec. 63.24   What protections must employers provide to applicants, volunteers and employees?

    (a) Indian tribes and tribal organizations must comply with the 
privacy requirements of any Federal, state, or other tribal agency 
providing background investigations. Indian tribes and tribal

constitutions when tribes wish to reorganize,
    (2) Adopting constitutional amendments,
    (3) Ratifying and amending charters,
    (4) Revoking constitutions, and
    (5) Facilitating the calling of such elections by the Secretary 
under provisions of a Federal Statute.
    (b) This part may also be used as a guideline by tribes wishing to 
hold constitutional elections that are not held pursuant to a Federal 
Statute.
    (c) Where a discrepancy might appear to exist between these 
regulations and a specific requirement of the statute governing the 
reorganization of a tribe or ratification and amendment of charters, the 
regulations shall be interpreted to conform with the statute.
    (d) As much as possible, Secretarial elections shall be scheduled so 
as to avoid their being held at the same time as tribal elections in 
order to avoid the confusion that results from different requirements 
for each kind of election.


<R05>
Sec. 81.3  Group eligibility.

    (a) No tribe which has voted to exclude itself from the provisions 
of the Indian Reorganization Act, or is otherwise precluded by law, may

a reorganized tribe seeking to amend its constitution and bylaws or 
wishing to vote to revoke such document shall do so under the 
regulations in this part.

amended under the regulations in this part.

constitutions. Any payments that might be necessary to non-Bureau staff 
assisting in the conduct of the election shall be made from tribal 
funds.

    (a) The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election to 
adopt a constitution and bylaws or to revoke a constitution and bylaws, 
upon a request from the tribal government.

adopt a constitution and bylaws pursuant to a Federal Statute upon 
receipt of a petition bearing the signatures of at least 60 percent of 
the tribe's adult members.
    (c) The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election to 
ratify a charter at the time the charter is issued, but he/she may issue 
a charter to a reservation-based tribe only upon petition by at least 
one-third of the adult members of the tribe. No ratification, however, 
shall be valid unless the tribe has a constitution adopted and approved 
pursuant to the relevant Federal Statute.
    (d) The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election on the 
adoption of amendments to a constitution and bylaws or a charter when 
requested pursuant to the amendment article of those documents. The 
election shall be conducted as prescribed in this part unless the 
amendment article of the constitution and bylaws or the charter provides 
otherwise, in which case the provisions of those documents shall rule 
where applicable.
    (e) If the amendment provisions of a tribal constitution or charter 
have become outdated and amendment can not be effected pursuant to them, 
the Secretary may authorize an election under this part to amend the 
documents when the recognized tribal government so requests.
    (f) Any authorization not acted upon within 90 days (tribes in 
Alaska shall be granted 120 days) from the date of issuance will be 
considered void. Notification of the election date as provided for in 
Sec. 81.14 shall constitute the action envisioned in this section. 
Extension of an authorization may be granted upon a valid and reasonable 
request from the election board. Copies of authorizations shall be 
furnished the requesting tribe or petitioners.
    (g) In those instances where conflicting proposals to amend a single 
constitutional or charter provision are submitted, that proposal first 
received

[[Page 250]]

by the officer in charge, if found valid, shall be placed before the 
voters before any consideration is given other proposals. Other 
proposals shall be considered in order of their receipt; provided, they 
are resubmitted following final action on the initial submission. This 
procedure shall also apply in those instances where new or revised 
constitutions are at issue.


<R05>
Sec. 81.6  Entitlement to vote.

    (a) If the group is a tribe, or tribes, of a reservation and is

time:
    (1) Any duly registered adult member regardless of residence shall 
be entitled to vote on the adoption of a constitution and bylaws.
    (2) Duly registered adult nonresident members and ill or physically

residents temporarily absent from the reservation, ill, or physically 
disabled.
    (c) If the group is a tribe, or tribes, without a reservation as

vote on the adoption of a constitution and bylaws by either arriving at 
a polling place or by requesting, properly completing, and timely 
casting an absentee ballot as determined by the election board pursuant 
to the relevant Federal Statute; provided, that outside of Alaska and 
Oklahoma, a reservation shall be established for the tribe before it 
becomes entitled to vote on the adoption of a constitution.
    (d) For a reorganized tribe to amend its constitution and bylaws, 
only members who have duly registered shall be entitled to vote; 
provided, that registration is open to the same class of voters that was 
entitled to vote in the Secretarial election that effected its 
reorganization, unless the amendment article of the existing 
constitution provides otherwise.
    (e) For a reorganized tribe to revoke its constitution and bylaws, 
only members who have duly registered shall be entitled to vote; 
provided, that registration is open to the same class of voters as was 
entitled to vote in the Secretarial election that effected its 
reorganization, unless the amendment article of the existing 
constitution provides otherwise.
    (f) For a reorganized tribe to ratify a charter or to adopt a 
charter amendment, any adult member who has duly registered shall be 
entitled to vote, provided that if the tribe is of a reservation, only 
duly registered members physically residing on the reservation shall be 
entitled to vote.


<R05>
Sec. 81.7  Adoption, ratification, or revocation by majority vote.

    Except as it may be further limited by this part, a contitution and 
bylaws, amendments thereto, or charter and charter amendments shall be 
considered adopted, ratified, or revoked if a majority of those actually 
voting are in favor of adoption, ratification, or revocation. The total 
vote cast, however, must be at least 30 percent of those entitled to 
vote, unless, with regard to amendments, the constitution provides 
otherwise. The names of persons appearing on the registration list who 
have not reached eighteen years of age by the date of the election, 
shall be removed from the list of registered voters when determining 
whether the required percentage of participation has been achieved. 
Unless the existing constitution or charter provides otherwise, none of 
the actions cited in this section shall become effective until they are 
approved by the Secretary. The validity of any charter ratification 
shall be dependent upon the tribe first having reorganized. Duly 
ratified charters shall be revoked or surrendered only by Act of 
Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 81.8  Election board.

    (a) There shall be an election board consisting of the officer in 
charge acting as chairman and at least two representatives of the tribal

at least two adult

[[Page 251]]

members of the tribe to serve. In addition, the officer in charge may 
appoint an interpreter and as many clerks and poll watchers as he/she 
deems necessary, but they shall not be members of the board.
    (b) It shall be the duty of the board to conduct elections in 
compliance with the procedures described in this part and in particular:
    (1) To see that the name of each person offering to vote is on the 
official list of registered voters;
    (2) To keep the ballot boxes locked at all times except when ballots 
are being counted;
    (3) To see that ballots are cast only by registered voters and that 
the voting list is checked to indicate this;

the close of the polls and then the absentee ballots, pursuant to 
Sec. 81.21;
    (5) To post and certify the election returns;

records for at least one year. At the end of one year, the officer in 
charge shall forward the contents of the boxes and other related 
material to the appropriate Federal Records Center.


<R05>
Sec. 81.9  Voting districts.

    If: (a) Voting districts have not already been designated for tribal 
elections in the tribal constitution or by tribal election ordinance or 
resolution; and (b) in the election board's judgment voting districts 
are needed, the board shall establish them and designate a polling place 
for each district. Where a reservation exists, no voting district may be 
established beyond its boundaries.


<R05>
Sec. 81.10  District Election Boards.

    (a) Where voting districts have been established by the tribal 
constitution, ordinance, resolution, or by the election board, the 
election board shall appoint district election boards for each district, 
which shall have the duties prescribed above for the election board 
except that they shall return to the election board:
    (1) The ballots (in marked and locked boxes),
    (2) All unused ballots, and
    (3) Their certifications of the district election results on the 
certification forms prescribed by the election board.
    (b) The board will compile the election results for the entire 
reservation and transmit them together with the aforementioned ballots 
and ballot boxes to the officer in charge.


<R05>
Sec. 81.11  Registration.

    (a) Only registered voters will be entitled to vote, and all 
determinations of the sufficiency of the number of ballots cast will be 
based upon the number of registered voters. The election board, upon 
receipt of authorization to conduct an election, shall notify by regular 
mail all adult members of the tribe, who to its knowledge are eligible 
to vote pursuant to Sec. 81.6 of the need to register if they intend to 
vote. Any tribal member who, to the election board's knowledge, will 
become 18 years of age within 150 days (180 days for Alaska tribes) from 
the date of authorization and who is otherwise eligible to vote shall 
also be notified and shall be eligible to register, provided that such a 
person shall not be entitled to vote if election day falls before the 
individual's 18th birthday. This notice shall be sent to an individual's 
last known address as it appears on the records of the local unit of the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction. Each notice addressed to a 
tribal member not residing on the reservation shall be accompanied by a 
preaddressed registration form (BIA Form 8302) which shall set forth the 
following information in the upper right corner:
    (1) OMB Clearance Number 1076-003, Expires June 30, 1983;
    (2) The name and address of the person desiring to register;
    (3) A statement with a signature line attesting that the individual 
is a tribal member and is at least 18 years of age, or will be within 
150 days, (180 days for Alaska tribes) from the date of authorization; 
and

[[Page 252]]

    (4) The three following statements: ``Completion of and return of 
this registration form is necessary if you desire to become qualified to 
vote in the forthcoming constitutional or charter election.'' ``This 
form, upon completion and return to the election board, shall be the 
basis for determining whether you qualify to have your name placed upon 
the list of registered voters and receive a ballot'' and ``completion 
and return of this form is voluntary.'' Members who qualify as absentee 
voters and wish to cast an absentee ballot must complete and return the 
above registration form before, or in conjunction with, requesting an 
absentee ballot in sufficient time to permit compliance with Sec. 81.12.
    (b) The following records shall be kept for all notices:
    (1) Names and addresses of persons to whom notices are mailed;
    (2) Date of mailing; and
    (3) A copy of each return registration request (including from whom 
received and date and time of receipt).
Tribal members living on the reservation who desire to vote must 
register with the election board in the manner it determines in time to 
permit compliance with Sec. 81.12. Registration procedures for such 
Indians shall be included in the notice of the need to register to 
resident members.

<R05>
Sec. 81.12  Voting list.

    The election board shall compile in alphabetical order an official 
list of registered voters arranged by voting districts, if any. This 
list shall designate, where applicable, those who have requested an 
absentee ballot and the members of the tribe who are or will have 
attained the age of 18 years within 150 days (180 days for Alaska 
tribes) from the date an election is authorized and who have duly 
registered to vote. A copy of this list shall be supplied to any 
district election board and shall be posted at the headquarters of the 
local administrative unit of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the tribal 
headquarters, and at various other public places designated by the 
election board at least 20 days prior to the election.


<R05>
Sec. 81.13  Eligibility disputes.

    The election board shall determine the eligibility of any written 
claim to vote presented to it by one whose name does not appear on the 
official list of registered voters as well as any written challenge of 
the right to vote of anyone whose name is on the list. Its decision 
shall be final. It shall rule on all claims no later than ten days 
before the election. Any claim not presented at least ten days before 
the election shall be disallowed. Nonresident claimants successfully 
appealing omission from the list shall immediately be furnished an 
absentee ballot. Omission of names from the voters list due to late 
registration, if notification (pursuant to Sec. 81.14) has been timely 
mailed, shall not be considered grounds for challenge.


<R05>
Sec. 81.14  Election notices.

    Not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice shall be given of the 
date of the election. Such notice shall include the location of where 
the results will be posted. The notice shall also advise that persons 
must register if they intend to vote. The election board shall determine 
whether the notice will be given by television, radio, newspaper, 
poster, or mail, or by more than one of these methods and whether in an 
Indian language in addition to English. A copy of any written election 
notice may be mailed to each registered voter and shall be posted at the 
local administrative unit of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and elsewhere 
as directed by the election board. At any time after receiving 
Secretarial authorization to hold the election, the board shall make 
available to the adult members of the tribe the text of any amendment or 
proposed constitution and bylaws, amendment thereto, charter, or charter 
amendment. The election board may determine the manner and timing of the 
distribution. However, the text shall be posted at least within the 
local administrative unit of the Bureau and the tribal headquarters 
within two days following the giving of notice of the election date by 
the election board.


<R05>
Sec. 81.15  Opening and closing of polls.

    If polling places are established, the polls shall remain open from 
8 a.m. to

[[Page 253]]

7 p.m., local time, unless different hours are set by the election board 
and the voters are informed of this in the election notice.


<R05>
Sec. 81.16  Interpreters.

    Interpreters, where needed, may be provided to explain the manner of 
voting to any voter who asks for instructions; provided, that all 
reasonable precautions are taken to ensure that the interpreter does not 
influence the voter in casting the ballot. The interpreter may accompany 
the voter into the booth upon the latter's request.


<R05>
Sec. 81.17  Electioneering.

    There shall be no electioneering during voting hours within 50 feet 
of any voting place. Sample ballots will be permitted in the voting 
booth.


<R05>
Sec. 81.18  Manner of voting.

    (a) Registered voters may vote by arriving at the appropriate 
polling place within the prescribed voting hours telling officials their 
names and addresses, signing their signature or mark on the voting list, 
and by marking and placing in the ballot box the ballots which will be 
handed to them. Voting shall be by secret ballot.
    (b) Voting may take place at the same time regarding the adoption of 
a constitution, the ratification of a charter, or the amendment of such 
documents; provided, that entitlement to vote for the proposal is 
consistent with Sec. 81.6 of this part and, provided further, that no 
charter shall be considered ratified if the proposed constitution is not 
adopted and approved.
    (c) The election board may choose not to use polling places and 
provide for the issuance and receipt of ballots entirely through the the 
United States Postal Service. In that event, the election board shall 
use the appropriate procedures set forth in this part relating to 
absentee balloting.


<R05>
Sec. 81.19  Absentee voting.

    (a) Nonresident members who have registered may vote by absentee 
ballot except as prohibited by Sec. 81.6. Also, whenever, due to 
temporary absence from the reservation, illness, or physical disability, 
a registered and otherwise eligible voter is not able to vote at the 
polls and notifies the election board, the voter shall be entitled to 
vote by absentee ballot. Upon his or her request, the election board 
shall give or mail absentee ballots to registered voters who may be 
entitled to receive them pursuant to Sec. 81.6. At the same time, such 
voters will also be provided a copy of the proposal to be voted upon 
when the full text does not appear on the ballot. Appropriate records 
shall be kept of those from whom requests are received and the date they 
were received. The election board shall allow an absentee voter no less 
than ten days from the mailing out of an absentee ballot to receive and 
return the ballot. This period shall not be afforded absentee voters 
desiring to exchange a mutilated or spoiled ballot less than ten days 
before the election date. While requests for absentee ballots received 
less than ten days before an election will be promptly honored, no 
absentee ballot will be counted if received later than either the close 
of the polls or after some other deadline established by the election 
board. The election board shall furnish election officials the names of 
individuals who have been given or had mailed to them an absentee 
ballot.
    (b) Accompanying the absentee ballot shall be:
    (1) An inner envelope bearing on the outside, the words ``Absentee 
Ballot,''
    (2) Instructions for completion of the absentee ballot,
    (3) A copy of the proposed amendment, and
    (4) A preaddressed outer envelope, imprinted on the back with a 
certificate as follows:

    I, (name of voter), hereby certify that I am a qualified voter of 
the (name) Tribe of Indians; that I will be 18 years of age or over at 
the election date and am entitled to vote in the election to be held on 
(date of election); and that I cannot appear at the polling place on the 
reservation on the date of the election because (indicate one of the 
following reasons): I am a non resident voter {time} ; or I expect to be 
temporarily absent from the reservation {time} ; or because of illness 
{time} ; or physical disability {time} ; or because no polling place has 
been established {time} . I further certify that I marked the enclosed 
ballot in secret.

        Signed:______________(voter's signature).


[[Page 254]]


    (c) The absentee voter shall mark the ballot and the ballot shall 
then be folded so as to conceal the marking and be placed in the 
envelope marked ``Absentee Ballot'' and the envelope sealed. The voter 
shall then place the sealed envelope marked ``Absentee Ballot'' in the 
outer envelope, seal it and complete the certificate and mail it. The 
preaddressed outer envelope shall be directed to the election board at 
the reservation. Absentee ballots must be received by the election board 
not later than the close of the polls or as otherwise directed by the 
election board.
    (d) The election board shall make and keep a record of ballots 
mailed, to whom mailed, the date of mailing, the address on the 
envelope, the date of the return of the ballot, and from whom received. 
After duly recording the receipt date of absentee ballots received on 
time, representatives of the election board shall open the outer 
envelopes, secure them and place the unmarked inner envelopes containing 
the ballots in a separate box reserved for that purpose. After all other 
ballots have been counted, the absentee ballots shall be counted 
immediately and included in the results of the election.


<R05>
Sec. 81.20  Ballots.

    (a) Ballots are to be prepared clearly and simply so that it is easy 
for the voters to indicate a choice between no more than two 
alternatives. For example, if a tribal council or the petitioners 
propose to reduce the one-half degree blood quantum required to qualify 
for membership but want the voters to decide whether it should be one-
fourth or one-eight, it would not be appropriate to put those two 
alternatives on the ballot. Doing so, would deny the voters an 
opportunity to vote for keeping the one-half degree blood quantum. 
Neither would it be appropriate to include all three blood quantum 
alternatives. Rather, those proposing the change should decide which 
blood quantum is to be submitted to the voters. The ballot in the 
Secretarial election would then give the electors the choice of marking 
either ``yes'' or ``no.'' A vote against the proposed change would be in 
favor of keeping the one-half degree blood quantum in the example.
    (b) In preparing ballots for proposed amendments, care should be 
taken to ensure that:
    (1) Each proposed amendment addresses only a single question.
    (2) If a proposed amendment conflicts with other provisions of the 
document being amended, the ballot shall be prepared so that the 
question includes all changes in those other directly related provisions 
in order to avoid contradictions within the document.
    (3) When more than one amendment is being submitted to the voters at 
a given election, the proposals shall be identified with alphabetical 
designations rather than numerical. The first of the several proposals 
would be labeled ``Proposed Amendment A,'' the next would be ``Proposed 
Amendment B,'' etc. Those amendments that are adopted and approved would 
then be assigned consecutive numbers to follow those assigned any 
earlier amendments that may have been make to that governing document. A 
statement similar to the following shall appear on each of the proposed 
amendments and shall be completed following the election:

    Having been duly adopted and approved, Proposed Amendment (A,B,C, 
etc.) is hereby designated as Amendment No. -- to the (Constitution, 
Charter, etc.) of the (name of tribe) Tribe.

    (c) The election board will supply all ballots. Each ballot shall be 
stamped in red ink on its face in the same place:

OFFICIAL BALLOT
(Facsimile Signature)
CHAIRMAN, ELECTION BOARD

    (d) Should any voter spoil or mutilate a ballot in the course of 
voting at a poll, the voter shall destroy it in the presence of the 
election officials and the election officials shall then make note of 
the destroyed ballot and furnish the voter with another ballot.
    (e) Any spoiled or mutilated absentee ballot may be exchanged for a 
new one by returning it to the election board with a request for 
another. The board shall honor the request promptly and note the dates 
of related actions. No extension of time will be granted for receipt of 
exchanged ballots that might not be cast on time.

[[Page 255]]


<R05>
Sec. 81.21  Counting of ballots.

    All duly cast ballots are to be counted. Even though it will not be 
possible to determine the intent of the voter regarding spoiled and 
mutilated ballots, they are to be counted for purposes of determining 
whether the required percentage of voters have cast their ballots in the 
election. Invalid ballots shall not be counted for purposes of 
determining the required percentage of votes cast.


<R05>
Sec. 81.22  Contesting of election results.

    Any qualified voter, within three days following the posting of the 
results of an election, may challenge the election results by filing 
with the Secretary through the officer in charge the grounds for the 
challenge, together with substantiating evidence. If in the opinion of 
the Secretary, the objections are valid and warrant a recount or new 
election, the Secretary shall order a recount or a new election. The 
results of the recount or new election shall be final.


<R05>
Sec. 81.23  Posting and certifying election results.

    (a) The results of the election shall be posted in the local Bureau 
of Indian Affairs office, tribal headquarters, and at other appropriate 
public places determined by the election board.
    (b) The election board shall certify the results of the election on 
the following form and transmit them to the local unit of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs:

                   Certificate of Results of Election

    Pursuant to a Secretarial election authorized by the (title of 
authorizing officer) on (date), the attached Constitution and Bylaws 
(Amendment, Charter or Charter Amendment) of the (name of tribe) was 
submitted to the qualified voters of the tribe and on (date), was duly 
(adopted) (ratified) (rejected) or (revoked) by a vote of (number) for 
and (number) against and (number) cast ballots found spoiled or 
mutilated in an election in which at least 30 percent (or such 
``percentages'' as may be required to amend according to the 
constitution) of the (number) members entitled to vote, cast their 
ballot in accordance with (appropriate Federal statute). Signed: (By the 
chairman of the election board and board members.)

Date: --------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 81.24  Approval, disapproval, or rejection action.

    (a) Action to approve or disapprove constitutional actions will be 
taken promptly by the authorizing officer following receipt of the 
original text of the material voted upon and the original of the 
Certificate of Results of Election from the officer in charge.
    (1) When required and granted, the authorizing officer shall furnish 
a tribe with written approval of constitutional actions. In the absence 
of an election challenge, the approval shall be issued promptly 
following the expiration of the contest period. Copies of his/her 
written approval, the Certificate of Results of Election, and the text 
of the material voted upon shall be transmitted to the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs, 18th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20245.
    (2) When a proposed constitution or charter action is rejected by 
the voters, the authorizing officer shall indicate in writing to the 
tribe his/her awareness of the election results and send to the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC, copies of the 
communication, the Certificate of Results of Election and the text of 
the material voted upon.
    (3) When the authorizing officer disapproves a constitutional 
action, he/she shall in writing promptly notify the tribe of the 
determination and furnish the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 
Washington, DC, a copy of the communication along with the Certificate 
of Results of Election and the text of the material voted upon.
    (b) Where Secretarial approval of proposed constitutional and 
charter actions is required in conjunction with authorization of an 
election, copies of the formal approval shall immediately be furnished 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC, by the authorizing 
officer and be followed in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section by copies of the Certificate of the Results of Election and the 
text of the material voted upon as soon as it is available.

signatures which are attached and the official filing date. Upon this 
written acknowledgment of the petition, the local Bureau official shall 
publicly post at the local Bureau unit serving the tribe a statement of 
the matter proposed in the petition. This statement shall remain posted 
for a period of 30 days from the official filing date.

Sec. 82.9  Challenges.

    (a) Once an official filing has been made, the local Bureau official 
shall immediately have copies made of the petition and its signatures. 
The local Bureau official shall keep these copies at the Agency or field 
office for 15 days following the date of official filing, during which 
time they shall be available for examination by authorized voters of the 
tribe upon request. During this 15-day period, challenges of signatures 
may be filed with the local Bureau official.
    (b) Challenges will be considered on the following grounds:
    (1) Forgery of signatures; and
    (2) Lack of proper qualifications of a signer.
No challenge will be considered which is not accompanied by supporting 
evidence in writing. In the event that an individual's name appears on a 
petition more than once, all but one of the names shall be stricken.


<R05>
Sec. 82.10  Action on the petition.

    (a) Within 30 days after the official filing date, the local Bureau 
official shall forward to the Area Director, or when the Area Director 
is the local Bureau official, directly to the Commissioner, the original 
of the petition and its accompanying signatures, together with 
recommendations concerning challenges and conclusions concerning:
    (1) The validity of the signatures;
    (2) The adequacy of the number of signatures; and
    (3) The propriety of the petitioning procedure.
    (b) The Area Director or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall 
within 45 days after the official filing date decide upon each challenge 
and the sufficiency of the petition and announce whether the petition 
shall be acted upon. If a decision is reached that the petitioning 
action is for any reason insufficient, the spokesman for the petitioners 
and the governing body of the tribe will be so informed and given the 
reasons for the decision. If a petitioning action warrants action by the 
Secretary or Commissioner, the spokesman for the petitioners and the 
governing body of the tribe concerned will be so informed. The decision 
in such matters shall be final. The procedures for implementing any 
action initiated by the acceptance of a petition will be determined in 
accordance with pertinent directives and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 82.11  Duration of petition.

    Any petition submitted under this part, shall be considered only for 
the purpose stated therein. Once a petition has been acted upon, it 
shall not be used again.

<R05>
Sec. 83.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish a departmental procedure 
and policy for acknowledging that certain American Indian groups exist 
as tribes. Acknowledgment of tribal existence by the Department is a 
prerequisite to the protection, services, and benefits of the Federal 
government available to Indian tribes by virtue of their status as 
tribes. Acknowledgment shall also mean that the tribe is entitled to the 
immunities and privileges available to other federally acknowledged 
Indian tribes by virtue of their government-to-government relationship 
with the United States as well as the responsibilities, powers, 
limitations and obligations of such tribes. Acknowledgment shall subject 
the Indian tribe to the same authority of Congress and the United States 
to which other federally acknowledged tribes are subjected.


<R05>
Sec. 83.3  Scope.

    (a) This part applies only to those American Indian groups 
indigenous to the continental United States which are not currently 
acknowledged as Indian tribes by the Department. It is intended to apply 
to groups that can establish a substantially continuous tribal existence 
and which have functioned as autonomous entities throughout history 
until the present.
    (b) Indian tribes, organized bands, pueblos, Alaska Native villages, 
or communities which are already acknowledged as such and are receiving 
services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs may not be reviewed under the 
procedures established by these regulations.
    (c) Associations, organizations, corporations or groups of any 
character that have been formed in recent times may not be acknowledged 
under these regulations. The fact that a group that meets the criteria 
in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (g) has recently incorporated or otherwise 
formalized its existing autonomous political process will be viewed as a 
change in form and have no bearing on the Assistant Secretary's final 
decision.
    (d) Splinter groups, political factions, communities or groups of 
any character that separate from the main body of a currently 
acknowledged tribe may not be acknowledged under these regulations. 
However, groups that can establish clearly that they have functioned 
throughout history until the present as an autonomous tribal entity may 
be acknowledged under this part, even though they have been regarded by 
some as part of or have been associated in some manner with an 
acknowledged North American Indian tribe.
    (e) Further, groups which are, or the members of which are, subject 
to congressional legislation terminating or forbidding the Federal 
relationship may not be acknowledged under this part.
    (f) Finally, groups that previously petitioned and were denied 
Federal acknowledgment under these regulations or under previous 
regulations in part 83 of this title, may not be acknowledged under 
these regulations. This includes reorganized or reconstituted 
petitioners previously denied, or splinter groups, spin-offs, or 
component groups of any type that were once part of petitioners 
previously denied.
    (g) Indian groups whose documented petitions are under active 
consideration at the effective date of these revised regulations may 
choose to complete their petitioning process either

[[Page 261]]

under these regulations or under the previous acknowledgment regulations 
in part 83 of this title. This choice must be made by April 26, 1994. 
This option shall apply to any petition for which a determination is not 
final and effective. Such petitioners may request a suspension of 
consideration under Sec. 83.10(g) of not more than 180 days in order to 
provide additional information or argument.


<R05>
Sec. 83.4  Filing a letter of intent.

    (a) Any Indian group in the continental United States that believes 
it should be acknowledged as an Indian tribe and that it can satisfy the 
criteria in Sec. 83.7 may submit a letter of intent.
    (b) Letters of intent requesting acknowledgment that an Indian group 
exists as an Indian tribe shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary--
Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20240. Attention: Branch of Acknowledgment and Research, 
Mail Stop 2611-MIB. A letter of intent may be filed in advance of, or at 
the same time as, a group's documented petition.
    (c) A letter of intent must be produced, dated and signed by the 
governing body of an Indian group and submitted to the Assistant 
Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 83.5  Duties of the Department.

    (a) The Department shall publish in the Federal Register, no less 
frequently than every three years, a list of all Indian tribes entitled 
to receive services from the Bureau by virtue of their status as Indian 
tribes. The list may be published more frequently, if the Assistant 
Secretary deems it necessary.

    (b) The Assistant Secretary shall make available revised and 
expanded guidelines for the preparation of documented petitions by 
September 23, 1994. These guidelines will include an explanation of the 
criteria and other provisions of the regulations, a discussion of the 
types of evidence which may be used to demonstrate particular criteria 
or other provisions of the regulations, and general suggestions and 
guidelines on how and where to conduct research. The guidelines may be 
supplemented or updated as necessary. The Department's example of a 
documented petition format, while preferable, shall not preclude the use 
of any other format.

    (c) The Department shall, upon request, provide petitioners with 
suggestions and advice regarding preparation of the documented petition. 
The Department shall not be responsible for the actual research on 
behalf of the petitioner.
    (d) Any notice which by the terms of these regulations must be 
published in the Federal Register, shall also be mailed to the 
petitioner, the governor of the state where the group is located, and to 
other interested parties.

    (e) After an Indian group has filed a letter of intent requesting 
Federal acknowledgment as an Indian tribe and until that group has 
actually submitted a documented petition, the Assistant Secretary may 
contact the group periodically and request clarification, in writing, of 
its intent to continue with the petitioning process.

    (f) All petitioners under active consideration shall be notified, by 
April 16, 1994, of the opportunity under Sec. 83.3(g) to choose whether 
to complete their petitioning process under the provisions of these 
revised regulations or the previous regulations as published, on 
September 5, 1978, at 43 FR 39361.

    (g) All other groups that have submitted documented petitions or 
letters of intent shall be notified of and provided with a copy of these 
regulations by July 25, 1994.


<R05>
Sec. 83.6  General provisions for the documented petition.

    (a) The documented petition may be in any readable form that 
contains detailed, specific evidence in support of a request to the 
Secretary to acknowledge tribal existence.
     (b) The documented petition must include a certification, signed 
and dated by members of the group's governing body, stating that it is 
the group's official documented petition.
    (c) A petitioner must satisfy all of the criteria in paragraphs (a) 
through (g) of Sec. 83.7 in order for tribal existence to be 
acknowledged. Therefore, the documented petition must include thorough 
explanations and supporting

[[Page 262]]

documentation in response to all of the criteria. The definitions in 
Sec. 83.1 are an integral part of the regulations, and the criteria 
should be read carefully together with these definitions.
    (d) A petitioner may be denied acknowledgment if the evidence 
available demonstrates that it does not meet one or more criteria. A 
petitioner may also be denied if there is insufficient evidence that it 
meets one or more of the criteria. A criterion shall be considered met 
if the available evidence establishes a reasonable likelihood of the 
validity of the facts relating to that criterion. Conclusive proof of 
the facts relating to a criterion shall not be required in order for the 
criterion to be considered met.
    (e) Evaluation of petitions shall take into account historical 
situations and time periods for which evidence is demonstrably limited 
or not available. The limitations inherent in demonstrating the 
historical existence of community and political influence or authority 
shall also be taken into account. Existence of community and political 
influence or authority shall be demonstrated on a substantially 
continuous basis, but this demonstration does not require meeting these 
criteria at every point in time. Fluctuations in tribal activity during 
various years shall not in themselves be a cause for denial of 
acknowledgment under these criteria.
    (f) The criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (g) shall be interpreted 
as applying to tribes or groups that have historically combined and 
functioned as a single autonomous political entity.
    (g) The specific forms of evidence stated in the criteria in 
Sec. 83.7 (a) through (c) and Sec. 83.7(e) are not mandatory 
requirements. The criteria may be met alternatively by any suitable 
evidence that demonstrates that the petitioner meets the requirements of 
the criterion statement and related definitions.


<R05>
Sec. 83.7  Mandatory criteria for Federal acknowledgment.

    The mandatory criteria are:
    (a) The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity 
on a substantially continuous basis since 1900. Evidence that the 
group's character as an Indian entity has from time to time been denied 
shall not be considered to be conclusive evidence that this criterion 
has not been met. Evidence to be relied upon in determining a group's 
Indian identity may include one or a combination of the following, as 
well as other evidence of identification by other than the petitioner 
itself or its members.
    (1) Identification as an Indian entity by Federal authorities.
    (2) Relationships with State governments based on identification of 
the group as Indian.
    (3) Dealings with a county, parish, or other local government in a 
relationship based on the group's Indian identity.
    (4) Identification as an Indian entity by anthropologists, 
historians, and/or other scholars.
    (5) Identification as an Indian entity in newspapers and books.
    (6) Identification as an Indian entity in relationships with Indian 
tribes or with national, regional, or state Indian organizations.
    (b) A predominant portion of the petitioning group comprises a 
distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times 
until the present.
    (1) This criterion may be demonstrated by some combination of the 
following evidence and/or other evidence that the petitioner meets the 
definition of community set forth in Sec. 83.1:
    (i) Significant rates of marriage within the group, and/or, as may 
be culturally required, patterned out-marriages with other Indian 
populations.
    (ii) Significant social relationships connecting individual members.
    (iii) Significant rates of informal social interaction which exist 
broadly among the members of a group.
    (iv) A significant degree of shared or cooperative labor or other 
economic activity among the membership.
    (v) Evidence of strong patterns of discrimination or other social 
distinctions by non-members.
    (vi) Shared sacred or secular ritual activity encompassing most of 
the group.
    (vii) Cultural patterns shared among a significant portion of the 
group that

[[Page 263]]

are different from those of the non-Indian populations with whom it 
interacts. These patterns must function as more than a symbolic 
identification of the group as Indian. They may include, but are not 
limited to, language, kinship organization, or religious beliefs and 
practices.
    (viii) The persistence of a named, collective Indian identity 
continuously over a period of more than 50 years, notwithstanding 
changes in name.
    (ix) A demonstration of historical political influence under the 
criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) shall be evidence for demonstrating historical 
community.
    (2) A petitioner shall be considered to have provided sufficient 
evidence of community at a given point in time if evidence is provided 
to demonstrate any one of the following:
    (i) More than 50 percent of the members reside in a geographical 
area exclusively or almost exclusively composed of members of the group, 
and the balance of the group maintains consistent interaction with some 
members of the community;
    (ii) At least 50 percent of the marriages in the group are between 
members of the group;
    (iii) At least 50 percent of the group members maintain distinct 
cultural patterns such as, but not limited to, language, kinship 
organization, or religious beliefs and practices;
    (iv) There are distinct community social institutions encompassing 
most of the members, such as kinship organizations, formal or informal 
economic cooperation, or religious organizations; or
    (v) The group has met the criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) using evidence 
described in Sec. 83.7(c)(2).
    (c) The petitioner has maintained political influence or authority 
over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the 
present.
    (1) This criterion may be demonstrated by some combination of the 
evidence listed below and/or by other evidence that the petitioner meets 
the definition of political influence or authority in Sec. 83.1.
    (i) The group is able to mobilize significant numbers of members and 
significant resources from its members for group purposes.
    (ii) Most of the membership considers issues acted upon or actions 
taken by group leaders or governing bodies to be of importance.
    (iii) There is widespread knowledge, communication and involvement 
in political processes by most of the group's members.
    (iv) The group meets the criterion in Sec. 83.7(b) at more than a 
minimal level.
    (v) There are internal conflicts which show controversy over valued 
group goals, properties, policies, processes and/or decisions.
    (2) A petitioning group shall be considered to have provided 
sufficient evidence to demonstrate the exercise of political influence 
or authority at a given point in time by demonstrating that group 
leaders and/or other mechanisms exist or existed which:
    (i) Allocate group resources such as land, residence rights and the 
like on a consistent basis.
    (ii) Settle disputes between members or subgroups by mediation or 
other means on a regular basis;
    (iii) Exert strong influence on the behavior of individual members, 
such as the establishment or maintenance of norms and the enforcement of 
sanctions to direct or control behavior;
    (iv) Organize or influence economic subsistence activities among the 
members, including shared or cooperative labor.
    (3) A group that has met the requirements in paragraph 83.7(b)(2) at 
a given point in time shall be considered to have provided sufficient 
evidence to meet this criterion at that point in time.
    (d) A copy of the group's present governing document including its 
membership criteria. In the absence of a written document, the 
petitioner must provide a statement describing in full its membership 
criteria and current governing procedures.
    (e) The petitioner's membership consists of individuals who descend 
from a historical Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes which 
combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.
    (1) Evidence acceptable to the Secretary which can be used for this 
purpose includes but is not limited to:

[[Page 264]]

    (i) Rolls prepared by the Secretary on a descendancy basis for 
purposes of distributing claims money, providing allotments, or other 
purposes;
    (ii) State, Federal, or other official records or evidence 
identifying present members or ancestors of present members as being 
descendants of a historical tribe or tribes that combined and functioned 
as a single autonomous political entity.
    (iii) Church, school, and other similar enrollment records 
identifying present members or ancestors of present members as being 
descendants of a historical tribe or tribes that combined and functioned 
as a single autonomous political entity.
    (iv) Affidavits of recognition by tribal elders, leaders, or the 
tribal governing body identifying present members or ancestors of 
present members as being descendants of a historical tribe or tribes 
that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.
    (v) Other records or evidence identifying present members or 
ancestors of present members as being descendants of a historical tribe 
or tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political 
entity.
    (2) The petitioner must provide an official membership list, 
separately certified by the group's governing body, of all known current 
members of the group. This list must include each member's full name 
(including maiden name), date of birth, and current residential address. 
The petitioner must also provide a copy of each available former list of 
members based on the group's own defined criteria, as well as a 
statement describing the circumstances surrounding the preparation of 
the current list and, insofar as possible, the circumstances surrounding 
the preparation of former lists.
    (f) The membership of the petitioning group is composed principally 
of persons who are not members of any acknowledged North American Indian 
tribe. However, under certain conditions a petitioning group may be 
acknowledged even if its membership is composed principally of persons 
whose names have appeared on rolls of, or who have been otherwise 
associated with, an acknowledged Indian tribe. The conditions are that 
the group must establish that it has functioned throughout history until 
the present as a separate and autonomous Indian tribal entity, that its 
members do not maintain a bilateral political relationship with the 
acknowledged tribe, and that its members have provided written 
confirmation of their membership in the petitioning group.
    (g) Neither the petitioner nor its members are the subject of 
congressional legislation that has expressly terminated or forbidden the 
Federal relationship.


<R05>
Sec. 83.8  Previous Federal acknowledgment.

    (a) Unambiguous previous Federal acknowledgment is acceptable 
evidence of the tribal character of a petitioner to the date of the last 
such previous acknowledgment. If a petitioner provides substantial 
evidence of unambiguous Federal acknowledgment, the petitioner will then 
only be required to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of 
Sec. 83.7 to the extent required by this section.
    (b) A determination of the adequacy of the evidence of previous 
Federal action acknowledging tribal status shall be made during the 
technical assistance review of the documented petition conducted 
pursuant to Sec. 83.10(b). If a petition is awaiting active 
consideration at the time of adoption of these regulations, this review 
will be conducted while the petition is under active consideration 
unless the petitioner requests in writing that this review be made in 
advance.
    (c) Evidence to demonstrate previous Federal acknowledgment 
includes, but is not limited to:
    (1) Evidence that the group has had treaty relations with the United 
States.
    (2) Evidence that the group has been denominated a tribe by act of 
Congress or Executive Order.
    (3) Evidence that the group has been treated by the Federal 
Government as having collective rights in tribal lands or funds.
    (d) To be acknowledged, a petitioner that can demonstrate previous 
Federal acknowledgment must show that:

[[Page 265]]

    (1) The group meets the requirements of the criterion in 
Sec. 83.7(a), except that such identification shall be demonstrated 
since the point of last Federal acknowledgment. The group must further 
have been identified by such sources as the same tribal entity that was 
previously acknowledged or as a portion that has evolved from that 
entity.
    (2) The group meets the requirements of the criterion in 
Sec. 83.7(b) to demonstrate that it comprises a distinct community at 
present. However, it need not provide evidence to demonstrate existence 
as a community historically.
    (3) The group meets the requirements of the criterion in 
Sec. 83.7(c) to demonstrate that political influence or authority is 
exercised within the group at present. Sufficient evidence to meet the 
criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) from the point of last Federal acknowledgment 
to the present may be provided by demonstration of substantially 
continuous historical identification, by authoritative, knowledgeable 
external sources, of leaders and/or a governing body who exercise 
political influence or authority, together with demonstration of one 
form of evidence listed in Sec. 83.7(c).
    (4) The group meets the requirements of the criteria in paragraphs 
83.7 (d) through (g).
    (5) If a petitioner which has demonstrated previous Federal 
acknowledgment cannot meet the requirements in paragraphs (d) (1) and 
(3), the petitioner may demonstrate alternatively that it meets the 
requirements of the criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (c) from last 
Federal acknowledgment until the present.


<R05>
Sec. 83.9  Notice of receipt of a petition.

    (a) Within 30 days after receiving a letter of intent, or a 
documented petition if a letter of intent has not previously been 
received and noticed, the Assistant Secretary shall acknowledge such 
receipt in writing and shall have published within 60 days in the 
Federal Register a notice of such receipt. This notice must include the 
name, location, and mailing address of the petitioner and such other 
information as will identify the entity submitting the letter of intent 
or documented petition and the date it was received. This notice shall 
also serve to announce the opportunity for interested parties and 
informed parties to submit factual or legal arguments in support of or 
in opposition to the petitioner's request for acknowledgment and/or to 
request to be kept informed of all general actions affecting the 
petition. The notice shall also indicate where a copy of the letter of 
intent and the documented petition may be examined.
    (b) The Assistant Secretary shall notify, in writing, the governor 
and attorney general of the state in which a petitioner is located. The 
Assistant Secretary shall also notify any recognized tribe and any other 
petitioner which appears to have a historical or present relationship 
with the petitioner or which may otherwise be considered to have a 
potential interest in the acknowledgment determination.
    (c) The Assistant Secretary shall also publish the notice of receipt 
of the letter of intent, or documented petition if a letter of intent 
has not been previously received, in a major newspaper or newspapers of 
general circulation in the town or city nearest to the petitioner. The 
notice will include all of the information in paragraph (a) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 83.10  Processing of the documented petition.

    (a) Upon receipt of a documented petition, the Assistant Secretary 
shall cause a review to be conducted to determine whether the petitioner 
is entitled to be acknowledged as an Indian tribe. The review shall 
include consideration of the documented petition and the factual 
statements contained therein. The Assistant Secretary may also initiate 
other research for any purpose relative to analyzing the documented 
petition and obtaining additional information about the petitioner's 
status. The Assistant Secretary may likewise consider any evidence which 
may be submitted by interested parties or informed parties.
    (b) Prior to active consideration of the documented petition, the 
Assistant Secretary shall conduct a preliminary review of the petition 
for purposes of technical assistance.

[[Page 266]]

    (1) This technical assistance review does not constitute the 
Assistant Secretary's review to determine if the petitioner is entitled 
to be acknowledged as an Indian tribe. It is a preliminary review for 
the purpose of providing the petitioner an opportunity to supplement or 
revise the documented petition prior to active consideration. Insofar as 
possible, technical assistance reviews under this paragraph will be 
conducted in the order of receipt of documented petitions. However, 
technical assistance reviews will not have priority over active 
consideration of documented petitions.
    (2) After the technical assistance review, the Assistant Secretary 
shall notify the petitioner by letter of any obvious deficiencies or 
significant omissions apparent in the documented petition and provide 
the petitioner with an opportunity to withdraw the documented petition 
for further work or to submit additional information and/or 
clarification.
    (3) If a petitioner's documented petition claims previous Federal 
acknowledgment and/or includes evidence of previous Federal 
acknowledgment, the technical assistance review will also include a 
review to determine whether that evidence is sufficient to meet the 
requirements of previous Federal acknowledgment as defined in Sec. 83.1.
    (c) Petitioners have the option of responding in part or in full to 
the technical assistance review letter or of requesting, in writing, 
that the Assistant Secretary proceed with the active consideration of 
the documented petition using the materials already submitted.
    (1) If the petitioner requests that the materials submitted in 
response to the technical assistance review letter be again reviewed for 
adequacy, the Assistant Secretary will provide the additional review. 
However, this additional review will not be automatic and will be 
conducted only at the request of the petitioner.
    (2) If the assertion of previous Federal acknowledgment under 
Sec. 83.8 cannot be substantiated during the technical assistance 
review, the petitioner must respond by providing additional evidence. A 
petitioner claiming previous Federal acknowledgment who fails to respond 
to a technical assistance review letter under this paragraph, or whose 
response fails to establish the claim, shall have its documented 
petition considered on the same basis as documented petitions submitted 
by groups not claiming previous Federal acknowledgment. Petitioners that 
fail to demonstrate previous Federal acknowledgment after a review of 
materials submitted in response to the technical assistance review shall 
be so notified. Such petitioners may submit additional materials 
concerning previous acknowledgment during the course of active 
consideration.
    (d) The order of consideration of documented petitions shall be 
determined by the date of the Bureau's notification to the petitioner 
that it considers that the documented petition is ready to be placed on 
active consideration. The Assistant Secretary shall establish and 
maintain a numbered register of documented petitions which have been 
determined ready for active consideration. The Assistant Secretary shall 
also maintain a numbered register of letters of intent or incomplete 
petitions based on the original date of filing with the Bureau. In the 
event that two or more documented petitions are determined ready for 
active consideration on the same date, the register of letters of intent 
or incomplete petitions shall determine the order of consideration by 
the Assistant Secretary.
    (e) Prior to active consideration, the Assistant Secretary shall 
investigate any petitioner whose documented petition and response to the 
technical assistance review letter indicates that there is little or no 
evidence that establishes that the group can meet the mandatory criteria 
in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of Sec. 83.7.
    (1) If this review finds that the evidence clearly establishes that 
the group does not meet the mandatory criteria in paragraph (e), (f) or 
(g) of Sec. 83.7, a full consideration of the documented petition under 
all seven of the mandatory criteria will not be undertaken pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this

[[Page 267]]

section. Rather, the Assistant Secretary shall instead decline to 
acknowledge that the petitioner is an Indian tribe and publish a 
proposed finding to that effect in the Federal Register. The periods for 
receipt of comments on the proposed finding from petitioners, interested 
parties and informed parties, for consideration of comments received, 
and for publication of a final determination regarding the petitioner's 
status shall follow the timetables established in paragraphs (h) through 
(l) of this section.
    (2) If the review cannot clearly demonstrate that the group does not 
meet one or more of the mandatory criteria in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) 
of Sec. 83.7, a full evaluation of the documented petition under all 
seven of the mandatory criteria shall be undertaken during active 
consideration of the documented petition pursuant to paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (f) The petitioner and interested parties shall be notified when the 
documented petition comes under active consideration.
    (1) They shall also be provided with the name, office address, and 
telephone number of the staff member with primary administrative 
responsibility for the petition; the names of the researchers conducting 
the evaluation of the petition; and the name of their supervisor.
    (2) The petitioner shall be notified of any substantive comment on 
its petition received prior to the beginning of active consideration or 
during the preparation of the proposed finding, and shall be provided an 
opportunity to respond to such comments.
    (g) Once active consideration of the documented petition has begun, 
the Assistant Secretary shall continue the review and publish proposed 
findings and a final determination in the Federal Register pursuant to 
these regulations, notwithstanding any requests by the petitioner or 
interested parties to cease consideration. The Assistant Secretary has 
the discretion, however, to suspend active consideration of a documented 
petition, either conditionally or for a stated period of time, upon a 
showing to the petitioner that there are technical problems with the 
documented petition or administrative problems that temporarily preclude 
continuing active consideration. The Assistant Secretary shall also 
consider requests by petitioners for suspension of consideration and has 
the discretion to grant such requests for good cause. Upon resolution of 
the technical or administrative problems that are the basis for the 
suspension, the documented petition will have priority on the numbered 
register of documented petitions insofar as possible. The Assistant 
Secretary shall notify the petitioner and interested parties when active 
consideration of the documented petition is resumed. The timetables in 
succeeding paragraphs shall begin anew upon the resumption of active 
consideration.
    (h) Within one year after notifying the petitioner that active 
consideration of the documented petition has begun, the Assistant 
Secretary shall publish proposed findings in the Federal Register. The 
Assistant Secretary has the discretion to extend that period up to an 
additional 180 days. The petitioner and interested parties shall be 
notified of the time extension. In addition to the proposed findings, 
the Assistant Secretary shall prepare a report summarizing the evidence, 
reasoning, and analyses that are the basis for the proposed decision. 
Copies of the report shall be provided to the petitioner, interested 
parties, and informed parties and made available to others upon written 
request.
    (i) Upon publication of the proposed findings, the petitioner or any 
individual or organization wishing to challenge or support the proposed 
findings shall have 180 days to submit arguments and evidence to the 
Assistant Secretary to rebut or support the proposed finding. The period 
for comment on a proposed finding may be extended for up to an 
additional 180 days at the Assistant Secretary's discretion upon a 
finding of good cause. The petitioner and interested parties shall be 
notified of the time extension. Interested and informed parties who 
submit arguments and evidence to the Assistant Secretary must provide 
copies of their submissions to the petitioner.
    (j)(1) During the response period, the Assistant Secretary shall 
provide technical advice concerning the factual

[[Page 268]]

basis for the proposed finding, the reasoning used in preparing it, and 
suggestions regarding the preparation of materials in response to the 
proposed finding. The Assistant Secretary shall make available to the 
petitioner in a timely fashion any records used for the proposed finding 
not already held by the petitioner, to the extent allowable by Federal 
law.
    (2) In addition, the Assistant Secretary shall, if requested by the 
petitioner or any interested party, hold a formal meeting for the 
purpose of inquiring into the reasoning, analyses, and factual bases for 
the proposed finding. The proceedings of this meeting shall be on the 
record. The meeting record shall be available to any participating party 
and become part of the record considered by the Assistant Secretary in 
reaching a final determination.
    (k) The petitioner shall have a minimum of 60 days to respond to any 
submissions by interested and informed parties during the response 
period. This may be extended at the Assistant Secretary's discretion if 
warranted by the extent and nature of the comments. The petitioner and 
interested parties shall be notified by letter of any extension. No 
further comments from interested or informed parties will be accepted 
after the end of the regular response period.
    (l) At the end of the period for comment on a proposed finding, the 
Assistant Secretary shall consult with the petitioner and interested 
parties to determine an equitable timeframe for consideration of written 
arguments and evidence submitted during the response period. The 
petitioner and interested parties shall be notified of the date such 
consideration begins.
    (1) Unsolicited comments submitted after the close of the response 
period established in Sec. 83.10(i) and Sec. 83.10(k), will not be 
considered in preparation of a final determination. The Assistant 
Secretary has the discretion during the preparation of the proposed 
finding, however, to request additional explanations and information 
from the petitioner or from commenting parties to support or supplement 
their comments on a proposed finding. The Assistant Secretary may also 
conduct such additional research as is necessary to evaluate and 
supplement the record. In either case, the additional materials will 
become part of the petition record.
    (2) After consideration of the written arguments and evidence 
rebutting or supporting the proposed finding and the petitioner's 
response to the comments of interested parties and informed parties, the 
Assistant Secretary shall make a final determination regarding the 
petitioner's status. A summary of this determination shall be published 
in the Federal Register within 60 days from the date on which the 
consideration of the written arguments and evidence rebutting or 
supporting the proposed finding begins.
    (3) The Assistant Secretary has the discretion to extend the period 
for the preparation of a final determination if warranted by the extent 
and nature of evidence and arguments received during the response 
period. The petitioner and interested parties shall be notified of the 
time extension.
    (4) The determination will become effective 90 days from publication 
unless a request for reconsideration is filed pursuant to Sec. 83.11.
    (m) The Assistant Secretary shall acknowledge the existence of the 
petitioner as an Indian tribe when it is determined that the group 
satisfies all of the criteria in Sec. 83.7. The Assistant Secretary 
shall decline to acknowledge that a petitioner is an Indian tribe if it 
fails to satisfy any one of the criteria in Sec. 83.7.
    (n) If the Assistant Secretary declines to acknowledge that a 
petitioner is an Indian tribe, the petitioner shall be informed of 
alternatives, if any, to acknowledgment under these procedures. These 
alternatives may include other means through which the petitioning group 
may achieve the status of an acknowledged Indian tribe or through which 
any of its members may become eligible for services and benefits from 
the Department as Indians, or become members of an acknowledged Indian 
tribe.
    (o) The determination to decline to acknowledge that the petitioner 
is an Indian tribe shall be final for the Department.

[[Page 269]]

    (p) A petitioner that has petitioned under this part or under the 
acknowledgment regulations previously effective and that has been denied 
Federal acknowledgment may not re-petition under this part. The term 
``petitioner'' here includes previously denied petitioners that have 
reorganized or been renamed or that are wholly or primarily portions of 
groups that have previously been denied under these or previous 
acknowledgment regulations.

Sec. 83.11  Independent review, reconsideration and final action

    (a)(1) Upon publication of the Assistant Secretary's determination 
in the Federal Register, the petitioner or any interested party may file 
a request for reconsideration with the Interior Board of Indian Appeals. 
Petitioners which choose under Sec. 83.3(g) to be considered under 
previously effective acknowledgment regulations may nonetheless request 
reconsideration under this section.
    (2) A petitioner's or interested party's request for reconsideration 
must be received by the Board no later than 90 days after the date of 
publication of the Assistant Secretary's determination in the Federal 
Register. If no request for reconsideration has been received, the 
Assistant Secretary's decision shall be final for the Department 90 days 
after publication of the final determination in the Federal Register.
    (b) The petitioner's or interested party's request for 
reconsideration shall contain a detailed statement of the grounds for 
the request, and shall include any new evidence to be considered.
    (1) The detailed statement of grounds for reconsideration filed by a 
petitioner or interested parties shall be considered the appellant's 
opening brief provided for in 43 CFR 4.311(a).
    (2) The party or parties requesting the reconsideration shall mail 
copies of the request to the petitioner and all other interested 
parties.
    (c)(1) The Board shall dismiss a request for reconsideration that is 
not filed by the deadline specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) If a petitioner's or interested party's request for 
reconsideration is filed on time, the Board shall determine, within 120 
days after publication of the Assistant Secretary's final determination 
in the Federal Register, whether the request alleges any of the grounds 
in paragraph (d) of this section and shall notify the petitioner and 
interested parties of this determination.
    (d) The Board shall have the authority to review all requests for 
reconsideration that are timely and that allege any of the following:
    (1) That there is new evidence that could affect the determination; 
or
    (2) That a substantial portion of the evidence relied upon in the 
Assistant Secretary's determination was unreliable or was of little 
probative value; or
    (3) That petitioner's or the Bureau's research appears inadequate or 
incomplete in some material respect; or
    (4) That there are reasonable alternative interpretations, not 
previously considered, of the evidence used for the final determination, 
that would substantially affect the determination that the petitioner 
meets or does not meet one or more of the criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) 
through (g).
    (e) The Board shall have administrative authority to review 
determinations of the Assistant Secretary made pursuant to Sec. 83.10(m) 
to the extent authorized by this section.
    (1) The regulations at 43 CFR 4.310--4.318 and 4.331--4.340 shall 
apply to proceedings before the Board except when they are inconsistent 
with these regulations.
    (2) The Board may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate 
to provide a full and fair evaluation of a request for reconsideration 
under this section to the extent they are not inconsistent with these 
regulations.
    (3) The Board, at its discretion, may request experts not associated 
with the Bureau, the petitioner, or interested parties to provide 
comments, recommendations, or technical advice concerning the 
determination, the administrative record, or materials filed by the 
petitioner or interested parties. The Board may also request, at its 
discretion, comments or technical assistance from the Assistant 
Secretary concerning the final determination or,

[[Page 270]]

pursuant to paragraph (e)(8) of this section, the record used for the 
determination.
    (4) Pursuant to 43 CFR 4.337(a), the Board may require, at its 
discretion, a hearing conducted by an administrative law judge of the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals if the Board determines that further 
inquiry is necessary to resolve a genuine issue of material fact or to 
otherwise augment the record before it concerning the grounds for 
reconsideration.
    (5) The detailed statement of grounds for reconsideration filed by a 
petitioner or interested parties pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section shall be considered the appellant's opening brief provided for 
in 43 CFR 4.311(a).
    (6) An appellant's reply to an opposing party's answer brief, 
provided for in 43 CFR 4.311(b), shall not apply to proceedings under 
this section, except that a petitioner shall have the opportunity to 
reply to an answer brief filed by any party that opposes a petitioner's 
request for reconsideration.
    (7) The opportunity for reconsideration of a Board decision provided 
for in 43 CFR 4.315 shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
    (8) For purposes of review by the Board, the administrative record 
shall consist of all appropriate documents in the Branch of 
Acknowledgment and Research relevant to the determination involved in 
the request for reconsideration. The Assistant Secretary shall designate 
and transmit to the Board copies of critical documents central to the 
portions of the determination under a request for reconsideration. The 
Branch of Acknowledgment and Research shall retain custody of the 
remainder of the administrative record, to which the Board shall have 
unrestricted access.
    (9) The Board shall affirm the Assistant Secretary's determination 
if the Board finds that the petitioner or interested party has failed to 
establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, at least one of the 
grounds under paragraphs (d)(1)--(d)(4) of this section.
    (10) The Board shall vacate the Assistant Secretary's determination 
and remand it to the Assistant Secretary for further work and 
reconsideration if the Board finds that the petitioner or an interested 
party has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, one or more 
of the grounds under paragraphs (d)(1)--(d)(4) of this section.
    (f)(1) The Board, in addition to making its determination to affirm 
or remand, shall describe in its decision any grounds for 
reconsideration other than those in paragraphs (d)(1)--(d)(4) of this 
section alleged by a petitioner's or interested party's request for 
reconsideration.
    (2) If the Board affirms the Assistant Secretary's decision under 
Sec. 83.11(e)(9) but finds that the petitioner or interested parties 
have alleged other grounds for reconsideration, the Board shall send the 
requests for reconsideration to the Secretary. The Secretary shall have 
the discretion to request that the Assistant Secretary reconsider the 
final determination on those grounds.
    (3) The Secretary, in reviewing the Assistant Secretary's decision, 
may review any information available, whether formally part of the 
record or not. Where the Secretary's review relies upon information that 
is not formally part of the record, the Secretary shall insert the 
information relied upon into the record, together with an identification 
of its source and nature.
    (4) Where the Board has sent the Secretary a request for 
reconsideration under paragraph (f)(2), the petitioner and interested 
parties shall have 30 days from receiving notice of the Board's decision 
to submit comments to the Secretary. Where materials are submitted to 
the Secretary opposing a petitioner's request for reconsideration, the 
interested party shall provide copies to the petitioner and the 
petitioner shall have 15 days from their receipt of the information to 
file a response with the Secretary.
    (5) The Secretary shall make a determination whether to request a 
reconsideration of the Assistant Secretary's determination within 60 
days of receipt of all comments and shall notify all parties of the 
decision.

determination within 120 days of receipt of the Board's decision to 
remand a determination or the Secretary's request for reconsideration.

[[Page 271]]

grounds determined to be valid grounds for reconsideration in a remand 
by the Board, other grounds described by the Board pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(1), and all grounds specified in any Secretarial request. The 
Assistant Secretary's reconsideration may address any issues and 
evidence consistent with the Board's decision or the Secretary's 
request.
    (h)(1) If the Board finds that no petitioner's or interested party's 
request for reconsideration is timely, the Assistant Secretary's 
determination shall become effective and final for the Department 120 
days from the publication of the final determination in the Federal 
Register.
    (2) If the Secretary declines to request reconsideration under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Assistant Secretary's decision

notification to all parties of the Secretary's decision.
    (3) If a determination is reconsidered by the Assistant Secretary 
because of action by the Board remanding a decision or because the 
Secretary has requested reconsideration, the reconsidered determination 
shall be final and effective upon publication of the notice of this 
reconsidered determination in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 83.12  Implementation of decisions.

    (a) Upon final determination that the petitioner exists as an Indian 
tribe, it shall be considered eligible for the services and benefits 
from the Federal government that are available to other federally 
recognized tribes. The newly acknowledged tribe shall be considered a 
historic tribe and shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities 
available to other federally recognized historic tribes by virtue of 
their government-to-government relationship with the United States. It 
shall also have the responsibilities and obligations of such tribes. 
Newly acknowledged Indian tribes shall likewise be subject to the same 
authority of Congress and the United States as are other federally 
acknowledged tribes.
    (b) Upon acknowledgment as an Indian tribe, the list of members 
submitted as part of the petitioners documented petition shall be the 
tribe's complete base roll for purposes of Federal funding and other 
administrative purposes. For Bureau purposes, any additions made to the 
roll, other than individuals who are descendants of those on the roll 
and who meet the tribe's membership criteria, shall be limited to those 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 83.7(e) and maintaining significant 
social and political ties with the tribe (i.e., maintaining the same 
relationship with the tribe as those on the list submitted with the 
group's documented petition).
    (c) While the newly acknowledged tribe shall be considered eligible 
for benefits and services available to federally recognized tribes 
because of their status as Indian tribes, acknowledgment of tribal 
existence shall not create immediate access to existing programs. The 
tribe may participate in existing programs after it meets the specific 
program requirements, if any, and upon appropriation of funds by 
Congress. Requests for appropriations shall follow a determination of 
the needs of the newly acknowledged tribe.
    (d) Within six months after acknowledgment, the appropriate Area 
Office shall consult with the newly acknowledged tribe and develop, in 
cooperation with the tribe, a determination of needs and a recommended 
budget. These shall be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary. The 
recommended budget will then be considered along with other 
recommendations by the Assistant Secretary in the usual budget request 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 83.13  Information collection.

    (a) The collections of information contained in Sec. 83.7 have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq. and assigned clearance number 1076-0104. The information will be 
used to establish historical existence as a tribe, verify family 
relationships and the group's claim that its members are Indian and 
descend from a historical tribe or tribes which combined, that members 
are not substantially enrolled in other Indian tribes, and that they 
have not individually or as a group been terminated or otherwise 
forbidden the Federal relationship. Response is required

[[Page 272]]

to obtain a benefit in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 2.
    (b) Public reporting burden for this information is estimated to 
average 1,968 hours per petition, including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
information. Send comments regarding this collection of information, 
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to both the Information 
Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Mail Stop 336-
SIB, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240; and to the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 
Washington, DC 20503.

<R05>
Sec. 87.3  Time limits.

necessary research to determine the identity of the ultimate or present 
day beneficiaries of judgments. Such research shall be done under the 
direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The affected tribes or

    (b) The results of all research shall be provided to the governing 
bodies of all affected tribes and groups. The Area Director shall assist 
the affected tribe or group in arranging for preliminary sessions or 
meetings of the tribal governing body, or public meetings. The Area 
Director shall make a presentation of the results of the research and 
shall arrange for expertise of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be 
available at these meetings to assist the tribe or group in developing a 
use or distribution proposal, bearing in mind that under the Act not 
less than twenty (20) per centum of the judgment funds, including 
investment income thereon, is to be used for tribal programs unless the 
Secretary determines that the particular circumstances of the affected 
Indian tribe clearly warrant otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 87.4  Conduct of hearings of record.

    (a) As soon as appropriate after the tribal meetings have been held 
and the Commissioner has reviewed the tribal proposal(s), the Area 
Director, or such other official of the Department of the Interior as he

[[Page 274]]

him, shall hold a hearing of record to receive testimony on the tribal 
proposal(s).
    (b) The hearing shall be held after appropriate public notice 
beginning at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such hearing, 
and after consultation with the governing body of the tribe or group 
regarding the date and location of the hearing, to obtain the testimony 
of members of the governing body and other representatives, spokesmen or 
members of the tribe or group on the proposal(s).
    (c) All testimony at the hearing shall be transcribed and a 
transcript thereof shall be furnished to the Commissioner and the tribal 
governing body immediately subsequent to the hearing. Particular care 
shall be taken to insure that minority views are given full opportunity 
for expression either during the hearing or in the form of written 
communications by the date of the hearing.
    (d) Whenever two or more tribes or groups are involved in the use or 
distribution of the judgment funds, including situations in which two or 
more Area Offices are concerned, every effort shall be made by the Area 
Director or Directors to arrange for a single hearing to be conducted at 
a time and location as convenient to the involved tribes and groups as 
possible. Should the tribes and groups not reach agreement on such time 
or place, or on the number of entities to be represented at the hearing, 
the Commissioner, after considering the views of the affected tribes and 
groups, shall within twenty (20) days of receipt of such advice by the 
Area Director, designate a location and date for such hearing and invite 
the participation of all entities he considers to be involved and the 
Commissioner's decision shall be final.

submit proposed legislation authorizing the use or distribution of the 
funds, together with a report thereon, to the Chairmen of both 
Congressional Committees, at the same time sending copies of the 
proposed legislation to the governing body of the affected tribe or 
group. Such proposed legislation shall be developed on the basis of 
further consultation with the affected tribe or group.
    (b) In any instance in which the Secretary determines that 
circumstances are not conducive to the preparation and submission of a 
plan, he shall, after appropriate consultation with the affected tribe 
or group, submit proposed legislation within the 180-day period to both 
Congressional Committee simultaneously.


<R05>

former reservation areas in Oklahoma, or Alaska Native villages; the 
formal educational level and the general level of social and economic 
adjustment of such reservation residents; the nature of recent 
programing affecting the subject tribe or group and particularly the 
reservation residents; the needs and aspirations of any local Indian 
communities or districts within the reservation and the nature of 
organization of such local entities; the feasibility of the 
participation of tribal members not in residence on the reservation; the 
availability of funds for programing purposes derived from sources other 
than the subject judgment; and all other pertinent social and economic 
data developed to support any proposed program.


<R05>
Sec. 87.10  Per capita payment aspects of plans and protection of funds accruing to minors, legal incompetents and deceased beneficiaries.

    (a) The per capita shares of living competent adults shall be paid 
directly to them. The shares of minors, legal incompetents and deceased 
individual beneficiaries, enhanced by investment earnings, shall be held 
in individual Indian money (IIM) accounts unless otherwise provided as 
set out in this section. While held in IIM accounts, said shares shall 
be invested pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 162a and shall be the property of the 
minors or legal incompetents or the estates of the deceased individual 
beneficiaries to whom the per capita payments were made.
    (b)(1) Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, minors' per capita shares, until the minors attain the age of 
18 years, shall be retained in individually segregated IIM accounts and 
handled as provided in Sec. 115.4 of this chapter. Should it be 
determined that the funds are to be invested pursuant to a trust, minors 
who will have reached the age of 18 years within six months after the 
establishment of the trust shall have their funds retained at interest 
in IIM accounts and paid to them upon attaining their majority.
    (2) A private trust for the minors' per capita shares may be 
established subject to the approval of the tribal governing body and the 
Secretary on the following conditions:
    (i) The tribal governing body specifically requests the 
establishment of

[[Page 276]]

such trust, and the trust provides for segregated amounts to each 
individual minor, based on his per capita share, and
    (ii) The trust agreement specifically provides that the investment 
policy to be followed is that of preserving the trust corpus and of 
obtaining the highest interest rates current money markets can safely 
provide. The trust agreement must further provide that maturity dates of 
investments cannot exceed the period of the trust and that only the 
following types of investment shall be made: United States Treasury 
obligations; Federal agency obligations; repurchase/resell agreements; 
United States Treasury bills; Bankers' acceptance, provided the assets 
of the issuing bank exceed $1 billion or the issuing bank pledges full 
collateral; Certificates of deposit, provided the assets of the issuing 
bank exceed $1 billion or the issuing bank pledges full collateral; 
Commercial paper, provided it is rated prime-2 by Moody or A-2 by 
Standard and Poor or is obligation of a company with outstanding 
unsecured debt rated Aa by Standard and Poor.
    (c) The per capita shares of legal incompetents shall be held in IIM 
accounts and administered pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 115.5 of 
this chapter.
    (d) The shares of deceased individual beneficiaries, plus all 
interest and investment income accruing thereto, shall be paid to their 
heirs and legatees upon their determination as provided in 43 CFR part 
4, subpart D.
    (e) All per capita shares, including all interest and investment 
income accruing thereto, while they are held in trust under the 
provisions of this section, shall be exempt from Federal and State 
income taxes and shall not be considered as income or resources when 
determining the extent of eligibility for assistance under the Social 
Security Act, as amended.
    (f) All per capita shares or portions thereof, including all 
interest and investment income accruing thereto, which are not paid out 
but which remain unclaimed with the Federal Government shall be 
maintained separately and be enhanced by investment, and shall, unless 
otherwise provided in an effective plan or in enabling legislation, be 
subject to the provisions of the Act of September 22, 1961, 75 Stat. 
584. No per capita share or portion thereof shall be transferred to the 
U.S. Treasury as ``Monies Belonging to Individuals Whose Whereabouts are 
Unknown.''

Sec. 87.11  Investment of judgment funds.

    As soon as possible after the appropriation of judgment funds and 
pending approval of a plan or the enactment of legislation authorizing 
the use or distribution of the funds, the Commissioner shall invest such 
funds pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 162a. Investments of judgment funds and of 
investment income therefrom will continue to be made by the Commissioner 
after the approval of a plan or enactment of use or distribution 
legislation to the extent funds remain available for investment under 
such plan or legislation, and provided that thereafter investments of 
judgment funds made available for tribal use are not undertaken by the 
tribe pursuant to authorizing law. Invested judgment funds, including 
investment income therefrom, shall be withdrawn from investment only as 
currently needed under approved plans or legislation authorizing the use 
or distribution of such funds.


<R05>
Sec. 87.12  Insuring the proper performance of approved plans.

    A timetable prepared in cooperation with the tribal governing body 
shall be included in the plan submitted by the Secretary for the 
implementation of all programing and enrollment aspects of a plan. At 
any time within one calendar year after the approval date of a plan, the 
Area Director shall report to the Commissioner on the status of the 
implementation of the plan, including all enrollment and programing 
aspects, and thenceforth shall report to the Commissioner on an annual 
basis regarding any remaining or unfulfilled aspects of a plan. The Area 
Director shall include in his first and all subsequent annual reports a 
statement regarding the maintenance of the timetable, a full accounting 
of any per capita distribution, and the expenditure of

[[Page 277]]

all programing funds. The Commissioner shall report the deficient 
performance of any aspect of a plan to the Secretary, together with the 
corrective measures he has taken or intends to take.

[[Page 281]]

May 18, 1916 (39 Stat. 158; 25 U.S.C. 123), tribal funds held in the 
United States Treasury may not be used for payment of attorney fees and 
expenses, in the absence of express authorization by Congress. Unless 
congressional authority has been obtained for the use of tribal funds, 
the payment of attorney fees and expenses shall be contingent upon a 
recovery by the Indians in the matters or claims covered in the

strictly conform to the provisions of the act authorizing the use of the 
funds.

         Payment of Tribal Attorney Fees With Appropriated Funds

    Source: 48 FR 3969, Jan. 28, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 89.40  General policy.

    In ordinary circumstances, legal services with respect to trust 
resources are provided for Indian tribe(s):
    (a) By private counsel employed by tribes when such tribe is 
financially able and elects to do so, or
    (b) By the United States as trustee through the Office of the 
Solicitor and/or the Department of Justice.
It is the policy of the Department of the Interior not to use federally 
appropriated funds to pay for private counsel to represent Indian 
tribes. Exceptions to that policy are listed in Sec. 89.41 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 89.41  Exceptions to policy.

    The Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs upon concurrence of the 
Solicitor and receipt of a recommendation as provided by Sec. 89.43 may, 
in his/her discretion, authorize the direct or indirect expenditure of 
appropriated funds to pay reasonable attorney's fees in order to permit 
an Indian tribe to secure private legal representation in the following 
circumstances:
    (a) When a tribe determines it necessary to bring a court action or 
to defend itself to protect its trust resources, rights claimed under a 
treaty, agreement, executive order, or statute, or its governmental 
powers and the Attorney General refuses assistance or advises that 
assistance is not otherwise available (Comptroller General's Opinion B-
114868, December 6, 1976).
    (b) When a tribe determines it necessary to institute or to defend 
itself in an administrative proceeding to protect its trust resources, 
rights claimed under a treaty, agreement, executive order, or statute, 
or to protect its governmental powers and the Solicitor is unable to 
provide representation due to a conflict of interest or other reasons.
    (c) When a tribe determines legal assistance necessary, other than 
for litigation, pursuant to a contract executed under Pub. L. 93-638 and 
the Solicitor has determined that the services of his office are not 
available.
    (d) When a tribe determines it critical, and the Assistant 
Secretary--Indian Affairs finds the concerns of the tribe to have merit 
after consultation with and the advice of the Solicitor, to intervene, 
in a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department or in an 
administrative proceeding being handled by the Solicitor because the 
responsible Government Attorney refuses either to exclude or to include 
some facet of the suit or proceedings which

[[Page 283]]

the tribe claims renders such legal representation completely inadequate 
to protect or in contravention of the rights and interests of the tribe. 
Prior to consulting with and advising the Assistant Secretary--Indian 
Affairs, in a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department, the 
Solicitor shall seek the comments and advice of the Attorney General.
    (e) When a tribe determines, and the Assistant Secretary--Indian 
Affairs, after consultation with the Solicitor concurs, that a 
substantial possibility of a negotiated settlement or agreement exists.
    (f) Payment of fees will not be allowed if such payment was not 
authorized before services were performed.
    (g) This rule applies to expenditure of appropriated Federal funds 
and not a tribe's own funds on deposit in the U.S. Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 89.42  Factors to be considered.

    The following factors are to be considered in determining whether 
funds should be paid to provide private legal representation for a 
tribe.
    (a) The merits of the legal position which the tribe asserts. 
Greater weight will be given to those cases where the tribe's legal 
argument is deemed particularly meritorious than to those cases where 
the tribe's position, although not entirely without merit, may be 
relatively weak;
    (b) The ability of the tribe to pay all or a part of its legal 
expenses out of its own funds. A review of the tribe's financial 
resources under this subsection will include an examination of the 
tribe's total expenditures to determine whether its expenditures for 
other purposes comport with the asserted importance of the case for 
which it seeks funds;
    (c) Whether the question the tribe seeks to litigate is being 
litigated in another case by another tribe;
    (d) Whether, as a matter of strategy, the issues the tribe seeks to 
litigate could be more satisfactorily resolved in another forum, in a 
different factual context, or a different time; and
    (e) Whether the issue should be litigated at all in preference to a 
legislative or other solution.


<R05>
Sec. 89.43  Procedures.

    The information collection requirements contained in this section do 
not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3051 et seq., because it is anticipated there will be fewer than 
10 respondents annually.
    (a) A tribe or other organization seeking funds under Sec. 89.41 
shall submit a written request through the Agency Superintendent and the 
Area Director, including
    (1) A detailed statement describing the nature and scope of the 
problems for which legal services are sought;
    (2) A statement of the terms, including total anticipated costs, of 
the requested legal services contract;
    (3) A current financial statement and a statement that the tribe 
does not possess sufficient tribal funds or assets to pay for all or a 
part of the legal services sought; and
    (4) A statement of why the matter must be handled by a private 
attorney as opposed to Department of Justice or Department of Interior 
attorneys.

All requests shall be considered by a committee consisting of the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs (Policy), or his delegate, the 
Director of the Office of Trust Responsibilities in BIA or his delegate, 
and the Associate Solicitor--Indian Affairs or his delegate.
    (b) If two of the three committee members recommend approval of a 
tribe's request, the request, along with the committee's recommendation, 
shall be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for final determination 
after consultation with and the advice of the Solicitor. The committee's 
recommendation shall indicate the amount of funds recommended to assist 
the tribe, the hourly rate allowed, the maximum amount permitted to be 
expended in the recommended action and the tribal contributions, if any. 
The Assistant Secretary shall approve the request only with the 
concurrence of the Solicitor.
    (c) The requirements imposed by this policy are supplementary to 
those contained in all existing regulations dealing with attorney 
contracts with Indian tribes and, in particular, those

contained in parts 88 and 89 of this title.

Sec. 101.2  Kinds of loans.

    Loans from the Indian Revolving Loan Fund shall be made for purposes 
which will improve and promote the economic development on Indian 
reservations.
    (a) Loans may be made by the United States to eligible relending 
organizations for relending to members for economic enterprises and to 
eligible tribes for relending to members, eligible corporations, 
cooperative associations, partnerships and subordinate bands and for 
financing tribal economic enterprises, which will promote the economic 
development of a reservation and/or the group or members thereon. Loans 
made by tribes or relending organizations may be for the following 
purposes:
    (1) To individual Indians or Natives, cooperative associations, 
corporations and partnerships, to finance economic enterprises operated 
for profit, the operation of which will contribute to the improvement of 
the economy of a reservation and/or the members thereon.
    (2) To individual Indians or Natives for purposes of purchasing, 
constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by 
the borrower.
    (3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a 
college or graduate education and degree in a field which will provide 
employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available 
from sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.
    (4) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of attending 
vocational schools which provide training in desired skills in a field 
in which there are employment opportunities, provided that adequate 
funds and/or training are not available from grant or scholarship 
sources, or federal or state training programs.

Loans may also be made by the United States to tribes for loaning to or 
investing in other organizations subject to the provisions in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (b) Direct loans may be made by the United States to eligible 
tribes, tribal organizations or corporations and tribal cooperative 
associations without fund restrictions. Direct loans to individual 
Indians, partnerships, and other non-tribal organizations shall not 
exceed $350,000. Direct loans from the United States shall be made for 
the following purposes:
    (1) To eligible tribes, individual Indians, Natives, or associations 
thereof, corporations and partnerships, to finance economic enterprises 
operated for profit, the operation of which will contribute to the 
improvement of the economy of a reservation and/or the members thereon.
    (2) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of purchasing, 
constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by 
the borrower.
    (3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a 
college or

[[Page 297]]

graduate education and degree in a field which will provide employment 
opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available from 
sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.
    (4) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of attending 
vocational schools which provide training in desired skills in a field 
in which there are employment opportunities, provided that adequate 
funds and/or training are not available from grants or scholarship 
sources or federal or state training programs.
    (c) Before a United States direct loan is approved, the Commissioner 
may require the applicants to prepare a market and capacity report on 
existing or proposed economic enterprises for which financing is 
requested if the operation involves manufacturing, selling or providing 
services.
    (d) Loans may be made to eligible tribes and Indian organizations 
for use in attracting industries and economic enterprises, the operation 
of which will contribute to the economy of a reservation. Tribes and 
Indian organizations may receive loans from the revolving loan fund for 
investment in or lending to other organizations regardless of whether 
they are organizations of Indians. However, not more than 50 percent of 
the loan made to an Indian organization may be used for the purpose of 
making a loan to or investing in other organizations. Applications for 
loans to provide funds for lending to or investing in other 
organizations already in operation will be accompanied by:
    (1) Audited balance sheets and operating statements of the other 
organization for the immediate three preceding years;
    (2) Pro forma operating statement and balance sheets for the 
succeeding three years reflecting the results of operations after 
injection of the additional funds;
    (3) Names of owners or if a corporation and stock has been issued, 
names of major stockholders and shares of stock owned by each;
    (4) A copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, if 
incorporated, or other organization papers if not incorporated;
    (5) Names of members of the board of directors and officers with a 
resume of education and experience, and the number of shares of stock 
owned by each in the corporation;
    (6) Purposes for which loan or investment will be used; and
    (7) If for manufacturing, selling or providing services, a market 
and capacity report will be prepared. If a proposed operation is to be 
established, the information in paragraphs (d)(2) through (7) of this 
section will be furnished. The Commissioner may require additional 
information on the other organization, if needed, to adequately evaluate 
the benefits which the Indian organization will receive and the economic 
benefits which will accrue to a reservation. If the loan is for 
relending to another organization, the application must show what 
security is being offered. If the loan is for investment in another 
organization, the equity to be obtained must be shown. Copies of all 
agreements, contracts or other documents to be executed by the Indian 
organization and the other organization in connection with a loan or 
investment shall be submitted with the application for a loan and will 
require Commissioner approval prior to disbursement of loan funds to the 
Indian organization.

Sec. 101.3  Eligible borrowers under United States direct loan program.

    (a) Loans may be made from the revolving loan fund to Indians, 
eligible tribes and relending organizations, and corporations, 
cooperative associations and partnerships having a form of organization 
satisfactory to the Commissioner. Loans may be made to applicants only 
when, in the judgment of the Commissioner, there is a reasonable 
prospect of repayment. Loans may be made only to an applicant who, in 
the opinion of the Commissioner, is unable to obtain financing on 
reasonable terms and conditions from other sources such as tribal 
relending programs, banks, Farmers Home Administration, Small Business 
Administration, Production Credit Associations,

[[Page 298]]

or Federal Land Banks, and is also unable to obtain a guaranteed or 
insured loan pursuant to title II of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 
(88 Stat. 77). In addition, the applicant will be required to have 
equity equal to 20 percent of the total cost of a new enterprise, or 20 
percent of the total cost of expansion of an existing enterprise.
    (b) The establishment of a United States direct revolving loan 
program on a reservation(s) for making direct loans will require the 
approval of the Commissioner. All requests for establishing a United 
States direct revolving loan program on a reservation will be 
accompanied by reasons for need, estimate of financing needs, and other 
sources of financing available to meet the needs. The Commissioner, in 
approving a United States direct loan program, may require the 
preparation and approval of a plan of operation for conducting the 
program.
    (c) If local lending conditions and/or the information in an 
application for a loan indicate a probability that an applicant may be 
able to obtain the loan from other sources, the Commissioner, before 
approving a United States direct loan, will require the applicant to 
furnish letters from two customary lenders in the area who are making 
loans for similar purposes, stating whether or not they are willing to 
make a loan to the applicant for the same purposes and amount. If a 
customary lender will make the loan on reasonable terms and conditions, 
the Commissioner will not approve a United States direct loan.

by:
    (a) A copy of operating statements, balance sheets and budgets for 
the prior two operating years or applicable period thereof preceding 
submittal of the application;

modifications thereof, to establish, acquire, operate, or expand an 
economic enterprise shall be accompanied by a plan of operation. 
Declarations of policy or other plans for conducting a relending program 
and plans of operation for economic enterprises require the approval of

corporation, partnership or cooperative association, for a United States 
direct loan or a loan under a relending program for financing an 
economic enterprise must, in addition to financial statements and 
budgets, include a copy of documents establishing the entity, or the

as amended at 57 FR 46471, Oct. 8, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 101.5  Approval of loans.

    (a) Loan agreements, including those used by relending organizations 
in operating a relending program, must be executed on a form approved by 
the Commissioner. On direct United States loans, the Commissioner will 
approve the loan by issuing a commitment order covering the terms and 
conditions for making the loan.
    (b) Applications for loans from relending organizations must be 
approved, if a tribe, by the governing body or designated committee, or 
other approving committee or body authorized to act on credit matters 
for a relending organization, before the Commissioner takes action on 
the application. This designated governing body of the tribe or 
committee must be authorized to act on behalf of the relending 
organization as evidenced in the organization's declaration of policy 
and plan of operation.
    (c) Corporations, partnerships and cooperative associations 
organized for the purpose of establishing, acquiring, expanding, and

    (a) United States direct loans. Any modification of the terms and 
provisions of a United States direct loan agreement must be requested in 
writing by the borrower and approved by the Commissioner. The borrower 
will submit the request for modification and will indicate the 
section(s) of the loan agreement to be modified together with a 
justification for the modification. Requests for modifications of loan 
agreements will include an agreement to abide by the provisions of the 
regulations in this part and future amendments and modifications 
thereof. In addition, a current credit bureau report, obtained by the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, will be made a part of the modification 
request.
    (b) Relending program. Any modification of the terms and provisions 
of a loan agreement of a borrower from an organization conducting a 
relending program must be in writing, agreed to by the borrower, and 
must be approved by the body authorized to act on loans and 
modifications thereof as provided in an approved declaration of policy 
and plan of operation or other plan. If a request for modification of a 
loan has been disapproved by the body authorized to act on the request, 
the rejected borrower may request the Commissioner to make a direct loan 
from the revolving loan fund if the Commissioner determines that the 
rejection is unwarranted.

<R05>
Sec. 101.7  Management and technical assistance.

    Prior to and concurrent with the approval of a United States direct 
loan to finance an economic enterprise, the Commissioner will assure 
under title V of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 that competent 
management and technical assistance is available to the loan applicant 
for preparation of the application and/or administration of funds loaned 
consistent with the nature of the enterprise proposed to be or in fact 
funded by the loan. Assistance may be provided by available Bureau of 
Indian Affairs staff, the tribe or other sources which the Commissioner 
considers competent to provide needed assistance. Contracting for 
management and technical assistance may be used only when adequate 
assistance is not available without additional cost. Contracts for 
providing borrowers with competent management and technical assistance 
shall be in accordance with applicable Federal Procurement Regulations 
and the Buy Indian Act of April 30, 1908, chapter 153 (35 Stat. 71), as

Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190), (42 U.S.C. 4321) and Executive Order

<R05>

    (a) On United States direct loans from the revolving loan fund and

sites, the Commissioner will take or require appropriate action to

Economic enterprises which extend credit and require payment of finance

requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.


<R05>
Sec. 101.11  Interest.

    (a) The interest to be charged on loans by the United States shall 
be at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance 
with section 104, title I, of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 
93-262, 88 Stat. 77). The interest rate shall be determined monthly and 
shall be effective on advances made on loans during the current calendar 
month. The interest rate shall be stated in the promissory note(s) 
executed by the borrower(s) evidencing the advance(s).
    (b) Additional charges to cover loan administration costs, including 
credit reports, may be charged to borrowers.
    (c) Education loans may provide for deferral of interest while the 
borrower is in school full time or in the military service.
    (d) The interest rate on loans made by relending organizations which 
are conducting relending programs shall not be less than the rate the 
organization pays on its loan(s) from the United States. Relending 
organizations which adopt and follow the same procedure in calculating 
interest on educational loans as is followed on educational loans made 
by the United States, will not be charged interest on loans from the 
United States on the amount outstanding on educational loans during the 
period the organization is not charging its borrowers interest.
    (e) Interest rates on loan advances made by the United States as 
shown on promissory notes dated before April 12, 1974, will remain in

terms. Unless otherwise specifically provided in a loan contract, the 
interest rate on advances made after April 12, 1974, will be at a rate 
determined pursuant to section 104 of Title I of the Indian Financing 
Act of 1974. The interest rate on loans for expert assistance will be at 
a rate established in Sec. 101.25 herein.

as amended at 57 FR 46472, Oct. 8, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 101.12  Records and reports.

    Loan agreements between the United States and tribes, corporations, 
partnerships, cooperative associations and individual Indians for 
financing economic enterprises, and to relending organizations, will 
require that borrowers establish and maintain accounting and operating 
records that are satisfactory to the Commissioner and submit written 
reports as required by the Commissioner. The records, accounts, and loan 
files shall be available for examination and audit by the Commissioner 
at any reasonable time. Unless an exception is approved by the 
Commissioner, borrowers will be required to have an annual audit made of 
the records of relending programs and economic enterprises financed with 
revolving loan funds, by a certified public accountant or a firm of 
certified public accountants or other qualified public accountants 
satisfactory to the Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 101.13  Security.

    (a) United States direct loans shall be secured by such security as 
the Commissioner may require. A lack of security will not preclude the 
making of a loan if the proposed use of the funds is sound and the 
information in the application and supporting papers correctly show that 
expected income will be adequate to pay all expenses and the loan 
principal and interest payments, indicating reasonable assurance that 
the loan will be repaid. Loans made by relending organizations 
conducting a relending program using revolving loan funds will require 
borrowers to give security for loans, if available, but the absence of 
security will not preclude the making of a loan if the proposed use of 
the funds is sound and the information in the application and supporting 
papers correctly show that expected income will be adequate to pay all 
expenses and the loan principal and interest payments, indicating 
reasonable assurance that the loan will be repaid. The declaration of 
policy and plan of operation of relending organizations conducting 
relending programs will include provisions covering the type and amount 
of security to be taken to secure loans made.
    (b) Land purchased by an individual Indian with the proceeds of a 
loan and land already held in trust or restricted status by the 
individual Indian may be mortgaged as security for a loan in accordance 
with 25 CFR 152.34 and the Act of March 29, 1956 (70 Stat. 62; (25 
U.S.C. 483a)). Mortgages of individually held trust or restricted land 
will include only an acreage of the borrower's land which the 
Commissioner determines is necessary to protect the loan in case of 
default. On proposed foreclosures which involve the sale of individually 
held trust or restricted land given as security for a loan, the tribe of 
the reservation on which the land is located will be notified in writing 
at least thirty calendar days in advance of the anticipated date of 
sale. Land purchased by a tribe with the proceeds of a loan from the 
revolving loan fund with title taken in a trust or restricted status, 
and land already held in a trust or restricted status by a tribe may not 
be mortgaged as security for a loan.
    (1) Title to any land purchased by a tribe or by an individual 
Indian with revolving loan funds may be taken in trust or restricted 
status unless the land is located outside the boundaries of a 
reservation or a tribal consolidation area approved by the Secretary. 
Title to any land purchased by a tribe or an individual Indian which is 
outside the boundaries of a reservation or approved consolidation area 
may be taken in trust if the purchaser was the owner of trust or 
restricted interests in the land before the purchase. Otherwise, title 
shall be taken in the name of the purchaser without any restrictions on 
alienation, control, or use.
    (c) Mortgages of leasehold interests in land held in trust or 
restricted status by an individual Indian, may be

[[Page 302]]

taken for the purpose of borrowing capital for the development and 
improvement of the leased premises when permitted in the lease or lease 
modification agreement. Such mortgages must be approved by the lessor 
and Commissioner. (70 Stat. 62, (25 U.S.C. 483a)).
    (d) Individuals may give assignments of income from trust property 
as security for loans. Tribes may give assignments of trust income as 
security for loans provided that the assignment shall be specific as to 
the source(s) of income being assigned. All assignments of trust income 
require approval by the Commissioner before becoming effective.
    (e) Chattels may be given as security for a loan. A mortgage on 
chattels, the title to which is known to be in trust, requires 
Commissioner approval. Non-trust chattels may be mortgaged without 
approval of any federal official.
    (f) Crops grown on lands held in trust or restricted status for the 
benefit of an individual Indian may be given as security for a loan when 
approved by the Commissioner. Crops grown on leased, trust or restricted 
land may be given as security for a loan when permitted by the 
provisions of a lease or when the owner gives written consent. Approval 
of the lien document by the Commissioner is required. Crops grown on 
trust or restricted land held by a tribe which has been assigned to an 
individual for use may be given as security for a loan, provided the 
terms of the assignment permit the assignee to give the crops as 
secuirty for a loan or the tribe's governing body specifically gives 
consent. The lien document requires Commissioner approval. Crops grown 
on non-trust or non-restricted land may be mortgaged without the 
approval of any federal official.
    (g) Title to any personal property purchased with a loan shall be 
taken in the name of the purchaser and mortgaged to secure the loan 
unless the loan is otherwise adequately secured. Tribes must adhere to 
the provisions of their constitutions and bylaws, corporate charters, or 
other organizational documents when mortgaging tribal property and 
assigning trust income as security for loans.
    (h) Relending organizations receiving a loan from the United States 
for relending shall be required to assign to the United States as 
security for the loan all securities acquired in connection with loans 
made to its members, sub-organizations, or associations from such funds, 
unless the Commissioner determines that repayment of the loan to the 
United States is otherwise reasonably assured. Funds advanced to finance 
a tribal economic enterprise shall be secured by an assignment of net 
income and net assets of the economic enterprise, unless the 
Commissioner determines that it is not feasible to require an assignment 
or that repayment of the loan to the United States is otherwise 
reasonably assured.
    (i) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or 
recorded in accordance with applicable state or federal laws except for 
those customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages 
on documented vessels will be filed at the customs house designated as 
the home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.

capacity of the borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 101.15  Penalties on default.

    Unless otherwise provided in the loan agreement between the United 
States and a borrower, failure on the part of a borrower to conform to 
the terms of the loan agreement will be deemed grounds for the taking of 
any one or all of the following steps by the Commissioner:
    (a) Discontinue any further advance of funds contemplated by the 
loan agreement.
    (b) Take possession of any or all collateral given as security and 
in the case of individuals, corporation, partnerships or cooperative 
associations, the property purchased with the borrowed funds.
    (c) Prosecute legal action against the borrower or against officers 
of corporations, tribes, bands, credit associations, cooperative 
associations, and other organizations.

    (d) Declare the entire amount advanced immediately due and payable.
    (e) Prevent further disbursement of credit funds under the control 
of the borrower.
    (f) Withdraw any unobligated funds from the borrower.
    (g) Require relending organizations conducting a relending program 
to apply all collections on loans to liquidate the debt to the United 
States.
    (h) Take possession of the assets of a relending organization 
conducting a relending program and exercise or arrange to exercise its 
powers until the Commissioner has received acceptable assurance of its 
repayment of the revolving loan and compliance with the provisions of 
the terms of the loan agreement.
    (i) Liquidate, operate or arrange for the operation of economic 
enterprises financed with revolving loans made to individuals, tribes, 
corporations, partnerships and cooperative associations until the 
indebtedness is paid or until the Commissioner has received acceptable 
assurance of its repayment and compliance with the terms of the loan 
agreement.
    (j) Report the name and account information of a delinquent borrower 
to a credit bureau.
    (k) Assess additional interest and penalty charges for the period of 
time that payment is not made.

action to offset the borrower's salary or civil service retirement 
benefits.
    (q) Refer the debt to the Internal Revenue Service for offset 
against any amount owed the borrower as an income tax refund.
    (r) Report any written-off debt to the Internal Revenue Service as 
taxable income to the borrower.

<R05>
Sec. 101.16  Default on loans made by relending organizations.

    Relending organizations conducting relending programs using 
revolving loan funds will follow prudent lending practices in making and 
servicing loans and take appropriate actions to protect their interests 
in the security given to secure repayment of loans. Declarations of 
policy and plans of operation shall include procedures which will be 
followed in acting to correct a default, such as modification of loan 
agreement or foreclosure and liquidation of security. Relending 
organizations employing a general counsel will refer legal questions on 
foreclosure procedures and sale of security to their counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 101.17  Uncollectable loans made by the United States.

    If the Secretary determines that a United States direct loan is 
uncollectable in whole or in part or is collectable only at an 
unreasonable cost, or when such action would be in the best interest of 
the United States, the Secretary may cancel, adjust, compromise, or 
reduce the amount of any loan made from the revolving loan fund. The 
Commissioner may adjust, compromise, subordinate, or modify the terms of 
any mortgage, lease, assignment, contract, agreement, or other document 
taken as security for loans. The cancellation of all or part of a loan 
shall become effective when signed by the Secretary.


[54 FR 34975, Aug. 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 101.18  Uncollectible loans made by relending organizations.

    (a) Relending organizations conducting relending programs using 
revolving loan funds may, when approved by the Commissioner, chargeoff 
as uncollectible all or part of the balance

[[Page 304]]

of principal and interest owing on loans which are considered to be 
uncollectible. Usually a chargeoff includes both principal and interest 
and provides for cessation of interest accruals on the principal balance 
owing as of the date of the chargeoff.
    (b) Action to chargeoff a loan will be in the form of a resolution 
enacted by the committee or body authorized and responsible for actions 
on loan matters for the relending organization. Before action is taken 
to chargeoff a loan as uncollectible, the lender will make an effort, to 
the extent feasible, to liquidate the security given for a loan and 
apply the net proceeds as a repayment on the balance of principal and 
interest owed. The chargeoff of a loan by a relending organization as 
uncollectible will not reduce the principal balance owed to the United 
States. A chargeoff will not release the borrower of the obligation or 
the responsibility to make payments when his or her financial situation 
will permit. Chargeoff action will not release the lender of 
responsibility to continue its efforts to collect the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 101.19  Assignment of loans.

    A borrower of a direct loan from the United States may not assign 
the loan agreement or any interest in it to a third party without the 
consent of the Commissioner. Relending organizations which are 
conducting relending programs may not assign the loan agreements of 
borrowers, or any interest therein, to third parties without the 
approval of the Commissioner and the borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 101.20  Relending by borrower.

    (a) A relending organization may reloan funds loaned to it by the 
United States with the approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner 
may authorize such lenders to approve applications for particular types 
of loans up to a specified amount.
    (b) Loans shall be secured by such securities as the lender and the 
Commissioner may require. With the Commissioner's approval, mortgages of 
individually held trust or restricted land, leasehold interests, 
chattels, crops grown on trust or restricted land, and assignments of 
trust income may all be taken as security for loans.
    (c) Title to personal property purchased with loans received from 
relending organizations using revolving loan funds in its relending 
program shall be taken in the name of the borrower.
    (d) The term of a loan made by a relending organization conducting a 
relending program shall not extend beyond the maturity date of its loan 
from the United States, unless an exception is approved by the 
Commissioner and the organization has funds available from which to make 
scheduled repayment on its loan from the United States. Loans made will 
be scheduled for repayment at the earliest possible date consistent with 
the purpose for which a loan is made and the indicated repayment 
capacity of the borrower.
    (e) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or 
recorded in accordance with federal or state law except those 
customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages on 
documented vessels will be filed at the custom house designated as the 
home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.

Sec. 101.21  Repayments on United States direct loans.

    Repayments on United States direct loans shall be made to the 
authorized collection officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who shall 
issue an official receipt for the repayment and deposit the collection 
into the revolving loan fund. Collections will first be applied to pay 
interest to date of payment and the balance applied on the principal 
installment due. Collections on loans made by relending organizations 
which have been declared in default in which the Commissioner has taken 
control of the assets of the program (including loans made with balances 
owing) will be made to an authorized collection officer of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs who shall issue a receipt to the payor and deposit the 
collection in the United States revolving loan fund. The relending 
organization's loan from the United States will be credited with the 
amounts collected from its borrowers,

[[Page 305]]

with the collections applied first on interest accrued and the balance 
applied to the principal. Payments on United States direct loans may be 
made in advance of due dates without penalty.

approved by issuance of a commitment order by the Commissioner.
    (b) No loan shall be approved if the applicant has funds available 
on deposit in the United States Treasury or elsewhere in an amount 
adequate to obtain the expert assistance needed or if, in the opinion of 
the Commissioner, the fees to be paid the experts are unreasonable on 
the basis of the services to be performed by them.
    (c) Contracts for the employment of experts are subject to the 
provisions of 25 U.S.C. 81 and require approval by the Commissioner.
    (d) Vouchers or claims submitted by experts for payment for services

reviewed by the borrower's claims attorney who will certify on the last 
page of the voucher or by attachment thereto, that the services have 
been rendered and payment is due the expert and that expenses and 
charges for work performed are in accordance with the provisions of the 
contract.
    (e) Requests for advances under the loan agreement shall be 
accompanied by a certificate signed by an authorized officer of the 
borrower certifying that the borrower does not have adequate funds 
available from its own financial resources with which to pay the expert. 
The Superintendent and Area Director will attest to the accuracy of the 
statement or point out inaccuracies. A copy of the voucher or claim from 
the expert

[[Page 306]]

will accompany the request for advance.
    (f) Loan funds will be advanced only as needed to pay obligations 
incurred under approved contracts for expert assistance. The funds will 
be deposited in a separate account, shall not be commingled with other 
funds of the borrower, and shall not be disbursed for any other purpose.
    (g) Loans shall bear interest at the rate of 5\1/2\ percent per 
annum from the date funds are advanced until the loan is repaid.
    (h) The principal amount of the loan advanced plus interest shall be 
repayable from the proceeds of any judgment received by the borrower at 
the time funds from the award become available to make the payment.

Sec. 103.2  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of this part 103 is to prescribe the terms, 
conditions and provisions under which loans made to eligible tribes, 
Indian organizations and individual Indians for financing economic 
enterprises which contribute beneficially to the economy of an Indian 
reservation or for housing on a reservation may be guaranteed or insured 
by the United States. Lenders are reimbursed for a percentage of a loss 
or losses incurred on loans made under the provisions of this part 103, 
as evidenced by an approved guaranty certificate or insurance agreement.
    (b) It is also the purpose of this part 103 to prescribe procedures 
for payment of an interest subsidy to lenders making guaranteed or 
insured loans to reduce the interest to be paid by the borrowers, for 
establishing loan guaranty and insurance premiums to be charged, and for 
collection of the premium. This program will provide Indians with 
additional sources of financing needed to develop and manage their 
reservation resources to a higher degree.


<R05>
Sec. 103.3  Kinds of loans.

    (a) Loans to tribes, eligible Indian organizations, and Indian 
individuals for financing economic enterprises which contribute to the 
economy of a reservation or its members or for housing on a reservation 
to be occupied by the borrower may be guaranteed or insured. Housing 
loans may be guaranteed or insured only after a determination has been 
made by the Commissioner that other sources of financing are not 
available to the applicant on reasonable terms and conditions.
    (b) Loans to tribes and organizations for the purchase of land may 
be guaranteed or insured only for purchasing land within the exterior 
boundaries of a reservation or land outside the exterior boundaries of a 
reservation which will be used by the borrower and/or its members for an 
economic enterprise which will contribute to the economy of a 
reservation. Loans to individuals may be guaranteed or insured for 
purchasing trust or restricted land in which the borrower owns an 
interest or land within the exterior or outside the exterior boundaries 
of a reservation. In all instances, the land must be used by the 
borrower in operating an economic enterprise which will contribute to 
the economy of a reservation. The Commissioner may require an applicant 
for a guaranteed or insured loan for the purchase of land to provide 
information showing that financing from other sources is not available 
on reasonable terms and conditions. Title to land purchased with a 
guaranteed or insured loan may be taken in trust or restricted status 
unless the land is located outside the boundaries of a reservation or a 
tribal consolidation area approved by the Secretary. Title to any land 
purchased by a tribe or an individual Indian which is outside the 
boundaries of a reservation or approved consolidation area may be taken 
in trust if the purchaser was the owner of a trust or restricted 
interest in the land before the purchase. Otherwise, title shall be 
taken in the name of the purchaser without any restrictions on 
alienation, control or use.
    (c) Funds included in loans for the purchase of non-recoverable 
items, as well as furniture, passenger carrying automobiles, trucks or 
pickups, televisions, radios, and household appliances are not eligible 
for guaranty or insurance unless required in the direct operation of an 
economic enterprise. Funds included in loans for payment of personal 
bills or obligations are not eligible for guaranty or insurance. Funds 
included in loans for payment of unsecured debts may be guaranteed or 
insured only if justified, due to the applicant's financial position and 
clearly to

[[Page 309]]

the advantage of the applicant in the operation of an economic 
enterprise.
    (d) No loans will be guaranteed or insured for the financing of a 
relending program.

Sec. 103.4  Management and technical assistance.

    (a) Prior to and concurrent with the issuance of a guaranty

competent management and technical assistance are available for 
preparation of the application and/or administration of funds granted 
consistent with the nature of the enterprise proposed to be or that is 
in fact funded. Assistance may be provided by available Bureau of Indian 
Affairs staff, other government agencies including states, a tribe, or 
other sources which the Commissioner considers competent to provide the 
needed assistance. Contracting for management and technical assistance 
may be used only when adequate assistance is not available without 
additional cost. Contracts for providing borrowers with competent 
management and technical assistance shall be in accordance with 
applicable Federal Procurement Regulations, and the Buy Indian Act of 
April 30, 1908, Chapter 431, section 25 (36 Stat. 861).
    (b) When submitting to the Commissioner a request for guaranty or 
insurance of a loan to finance an economic enterprise, a lender will 
include, as part of the request, or separately, its evaluation of the 
applicant's need for management and technical assistance, specific areas 
of need, and whether the lender will provide such assistance to the 
applicant. A lender making loans under the provisions of a general 
insurance agreement may determine each applicant's need for management 
and technical assistance when financing of an economic enterprise is 
involved. If a lender determines that an applicant will need management 
and technical assistance, it will notify the Commissioner in writing 
indicating the specific areas of need, and whether it will provide such 
assistance.

    Tribes and Indian organizations having a form of organization 
satisfactory to the Commissioner recognized by the Federal Government as

    (a) Those financial institutions subject to examination and 
supervision by an agency of the United States, a state, or the District 
of Columbia, having the capacity to evaluate, process, disburse, and 
service loans, and Indian tribes making loans from their own funds to 
other tribes or organizations of Indians, are eligible to have loans 
insured under this part 103. Loans made by any lender regularly engaged 
in making loans, having the capacity to accept and process applications

    Loans, except those excluded in Sec. 103.10, made by any lender 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 103.9(a), which are satisfactory to the 
Commissioner may be guaranteed. Applications for guaranty will be 
considered on a loan by loan basis. No guaranty shall be effective until 
issuance of a guaranty certificate by the Commissioner and receipt of 
the guaranty premium from the lender. A guaranty certificate shall be 
issued only when, in the judgment of the Commissioner, there is a 
reasonable prospect of repayment of the loan.

[[Page 311]]


<R05>
Sec. 103.12  Insured loans.

    (a) Eligible lenders, as prescribed in Sec. 103.9, and tribes making 
loans from their own funds to other tribes or Indian organizations, may 
make insured loans, except those excluded in Sec. 103.10 pursuant to the 
provisions of an insurance agreement entered into between the 
Commissioner and the lender. Insurance agreements may be entered into by 
the Commissioner and eligible lenders which will authorize the lenders 
to make insured loans to eligible applicants without the Commissioner's 
approval of each individual loan. Separate insurance agreements will be 
issued by the Commissioner for those loans which require the issuance of 
individual insurance agreements.
    (b) Lenders will make loans only when there is a reasonable prospect 
of repayment. The insurance on any loan made under the provisions of an 
insurance agreement will not be effective until receipt of the insurance 
premium by the Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 103.13  Amount of guaranty.

    (a) The percentage of a loan that is guaranteed shall be the minimum 
necessary to obtain financing for an applicant, but may not exceed 90 
percent of the unpaid principal and interest. The liability under the 
guaranty shall increase or decrease pro rata with an increase or 
decrease in the unpaid portion of the principal amount of the 
obligation. No loan to an individual Indian, partnership, or other non-
tribal organization may be guaranteed for an unpaid principal amount in 
excess of $500,000 or such maximum amount provided in any amendments to 
the Indian Financing Act of 1974.
    (b) Applications of minors as determined by applicable state and 
federal law, may not be approved unless the natural parents or legal 
guardians, with reputations as being responsible individuals, co-sign 
the promissory note(s) and securing document(s). Not more than one 
guaranteed loan may be in effect with the same borrower at any time 
without the prior approval of the Commissioner.

<R05>
Sec. 103.14  Amount of insurance.

    (a) The insurance provisions will apply to loans made by a 
particular lender under the terms of an insurance agreement entered into 
between the Commissioner and the lender. The insurance procedure will be 
used primarily for loans to finance small economic enterprises and 
secondarily for housing. A lender may be reimbursed for a loss on a 
particular loan in an amount not to exceed 90 percent of the loss on 
principal and unpaid accrued interest on the loan. However, the total 
reimbursement to a lender for losses may not exceed 15 percent of the 
aggregate of insured loans made by it.
    (b) Loans for any amount made by tribes from their own funds to 
other tribes or Indian organizations will not be insured without the 
prior approval of the Commissioner. No loan to finance an economic 
enterprise with a principal amount in excess of $50,000 shall be insured 
without the prior approval of the Commissioner. No loan to an individual 
Indian may be insured which would cause the total unpaid principal 
amount to exceed $100,000. Any loan to an individual Indian having a 
principal amount in excess of $50,000 will require prior approval of the 
Commissioner. No loan to an individual with a principal amount of less 
than $2,500 or for a term of less than one year may be insured. No loan 
to a tribe or Indian organization for a principal amount of less than 
$10,000 for a term of less than one year may be insured. An exception 
may be made to these limitations on amounts and time, if approved by the 
Commissioner.
    (c) Applications of minors may not be approved unless the natural 
parents or legal guardians, with reputations as being responsible 
individuals, co-sign the promissory note(s) and securing documents. Not 
more than one insured loan may be in effect with the same borrower at 
any time without the prior approval of the Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 103.15  Applications for loan guaranties or insurance.

    (a) Applicants for loans will deal directly with lenders for both 
guaranteed and insured loans. The form of loan applications will be

thereto, must include or show the following:
    (1) The name and address of the borrower with the tax identification

    (6) Hazard and liability insurance to be carried;
    (7) Interest rate;
    (8) Repayment schedule;
    (9) Repayment source(s);

statements for at least three years;
    (15) Balance sheets and operating statements for the two preceding 
years, or applicable period thereof if already in operation;
    (16) The lender's evaluation of the economic feasibility of the 
enterprise and internal credit memorandum; and
    (17) A current credit bureau report on the borrower.
Applications will also show the percentage of guaranty requested.
    (b) Reasonable assurance of repayment will be considered to exist:
    (1) In the case of individuals, where past operations and future 
prospects of the applicant's operations demonstrate ability to repay the 
loan from production, earnings, or other assets. Full consideration will 
be given to the applicant's managerial ability and experience.
    (2) In the case of tribes and Indian organizations, where past 
operations or future plans of operations indicate that the economic 
enterprise for which financing is requested is economically sound. Full 
consideration will be given to arrangements for efficient management of 
the economic enterprise for which financing is requested.
    (c) The Commissioner may review applications for guaranteed loans 
individually and independently from the lending institution.

<R05>
Sec. 103.16  Loan otherwise available.

    If the information in an application for a guaranteed or insured 
loan indicates that the applicant may obtain the loan without a guaranty 
or insurance, the Commissioner may deny the request for a guaranty or 
insurance.

<R05>
Sec. 103.17  Refinancing.

    (a) Applications for loans to refinance indebtedness will be 
approved only if justified and required due to the applicant's financial 
position and if clearly to the advantage of the applicant. Applications 
to refinance loans to an economic enterprise will be accompanied by 
financial and cash flow statements required in Sec. 103.15(a) (1) 
through (17). A guaranty of a loan to refinance existing indebtedness 
will be considered only if the loan will result in a significantly lower 
lender's interest rate to the borrower, or provide a substantially 
longer term for repayment of the loan, or decrease the loan-to-asset 
value ratio of the business being financed.
    (b) Applications for refinancing loans not guaranteed or insured 
under this part 103 will not be approved for guaranty or insurance if, 
in the opinion of the Commissioner, the submittal of the application is 
motivated primarily to

[[Page 313]]

obtain guaranty or insurance of a loan which otherwise would be made.

Sec. 103.18  Furnishing additional information.

    The Commissioner may require either the lender or the borrower, or 
both, to furnish additional information or justification for a loan 
prior to issuance of a guaranty certificate or insurance agreement where 
Commissioner approval of an individual insured loan is required.


<R05>
Sec. 103.19  Approval of guaranteed loans.

    (a) Upon a lender's approval of an application for a guaranteed 
loan, the lender will forward the application in duplicate to the 
Commissioner with a ``Request for Guaranty''. The Commissioner will 
approve the application by issuance of a ``Guaranty Certificate'' which 
will show the percentage amount of the loan guaranteed, the premium to 
be paid to the Commissioner and the interest subsidy to be paid on the 
loan by the United States.
    (b) If the application is not approved, the original will be 
returned to the lender with an explanation, and a copy furnished the 
loan applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 103.20  Approval of insured loans.

    After a lender approves a loan eligible for insurance in accordance 
with an approved insurance agreement, the lender will proceed as 
authorized by the agreement. Applications for insured loans which 
require approval by the Commissioner as prescribed in Sec. 103.14 will 
be forwarded in duplicate to the Commissioner with a ``Request for 
Insurance'' signed by the lender. The Commissioner will approve the 
application by issuance of an ``Insurance Agreement''. If the 
application is not approved, the original will be returned to the lender 
with an explanation.


<R05>
Sec. 103.21  Modification of loan agreements.

    (a) Guaranteed and insured loans may be modified with the approval 
of the parties to the original loan agreement. Modification of 
guaranteed loans and those insured loans which required Commissioner 
approval, requires the Commissioner's approval only if the modification 
involves:
    (1) Change of the repayment schedules,
    (2) Changes in the prime security,
    (3) Change of interest rate,
    (4) Change in the use of loan funds,
    (5) Increase in the principal amount of a loan, except as provided 
in Sec. 103.22,
    (6) Change of the plan of operation,
    (7) Amendment or changes in the organization papers of the borrower,
    (8) Changes in partnership agreements, and
    (9) Change in the location of an enterprise.
    (b) Lenders making insured loans which under the provisions of an 
approved insurance agreement do not require Commissioner approval shall 
use prudence in approving requests for modifications of loan agreements 
and follow the lender's customary procedures and practices which are 
used in connection with noninsured loans made by it. Modifications are 
to be in compliance with the provisions of Secs. 103.13, 103.14, and 
103.24. Lenders making insured loans under the provisions of such an 
insurance agreement shall notify the Commissioner not later than 20 days 
after approval of a modification of such insured loan. Modifications of 
the organization papers of corporations or cooperative associations and 
partnership agreements and plans of operation which originally required 
Commissioner approval, require approval by the Commissioner upon 
modification.


<R05>
Sec. 103.22  Protective advances.

    When provided for in a loan agreement, and subject to the 
limitations on the amounts and terms of loans as provided in 
Secs. 103.13, 103.14, and 103.24, lenders may advance, for certain 
purposes, up to 10 percent of the amount for which a guaranteed or 
insured loan originally was approved. If the borrower is unable to 
provide the funds or refuses to do so, an advance may be made for 
purposes necessary and proper for the preservation, maintenance or 
repair of the property purchased with or given to secure the loan; for 
accrued taxes, special assessments, ground and water rents, and hazard 
and liability insurance premiums; and for any other

[[Page 314]]

purpose necessary for the protection of the interest of the lender or 
borrower. The additional advance will be charged against the borrower. 
Repayment of the protective advance shall be automatically guaranteed or 
insured at the same percentage rate as applied to the original amount of 
the loan upon the Commissioner's receiving notice from the lender that 
an additional amount has been advanced with a statement as to the 
necessity and purpose(s) of the advance. Such documentation shall be 
furnished along with the premium for the additional amount pursuant to 
Sec. 103.43(b). The amount of any additional advance shall be scheduled 
for repayment proportionately over the remaining installments of the 
unpaid principal balance of the loan. The interest rate charged on 
protective advances as provided for in this section will be determined 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.41.


<R05>
Sec. 103.23  Increase in principal of loans.

    (a) Borrowers requiring additional funds may apply for an increase 
in a guaranteed or insured loan with the same lender. Applications to 
increase the amount of guaranteed and insured loans which originally 
were approved by the Commissioner, require his approval upon increases 
in amounts. Lenders making insured loans which under the provisions of 
an approved insurance agreement which did not require Commissioner 
approval, may approve applications for an increase in the principal of 
such loans subject to compliance with the limitations contained in 
Secs. 103.14 and 103.24. Such insured lenders shall immediately notify 
the Commissioner upon approval of an increase in the principal of a loan 
and remit the premium on the increase pursuant to Sec. 103.43(b).
    (b) The application for an increase in the amount of a loan must 
show the reasons why an increase is needed, the amount and purposes for 
which the funds will be used, and the repayment schedule. If the 
financing involves an economic enterprise, the application must be 
accompanied by the information required in Sec. 103.15(a)(1) through 
(17) of this part.
    (c) The interest rate to be charged on principal increases will be 
determined in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.41.

<R05>
Sec. 103.24  Maturity.

    The period of maturity of guaranteed and insured loans will be 
determined according to the circumstances, but may not extend beyond 30 
years from the date of the first advance. All maturities will be 
consistent with sound business practices and customs of lenders in the 
area.


<R05>
Sec. 103.25  Amortization.

    All loans shall be scheduled for repayment at the earliest 
practicable date consistent with the purpose(s) of the loans and the 
repayment capacity of the borrowers. Lenders will require amortization 
in accordance with customary practices in the area for loans for the 
same purposes. Loan payments may be scheduled for repayment either 
monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. Balloon installments 
shall be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 103.26  Prepayments.

    Borrowers whose loans are guaranteed or insured under this part 103 
shall have the right to prepay all or any part of the indebtedness at 
any time without penalty unless otherwise provided for in the loan 
agreement. Lenders and borrowers may agree that prepayments applied to 
the latest loan installments may be reapplied to current installment(s) 
to cure or prevent any subsequent default. The Commissioner shall be 
notified promptly by the lender when payments are made in advance of the 
due dates.


<R05>
Sec. 103.27  Amount of security.

    Lenders will require borrowers to give security, if available, up to 
an amount adequate to protect the loan, without consideration of the 
guaranty or insurance. The lender shall itemize and describe the 
collateral given as security as described in Secs. 103.15(a)(5) and (10) 
of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 103.28  Filing and recording.

    (a) All securing documents and financing statements, when 
applicable, except assignments of income from trust land and mortgages 
on documented vessels, shall be filed or recorded in the appropriate 
county or other public office in accordance with state law. Mortgages on 
documented vessels will be filed at the Customs House designated as the 
home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document. Security 
interests in personal property will be perfected in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in states in 
which the code has been adopted.
    (b) Lenders are responsible for filing a copy of assignments of 
income from trust land with the office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
having jurisdiction over the trust land involved and for filing or 
recording other securing instruments pursuant to the laws of the state 
in which the property is located or in the proper Customs House. Lenders 
must also see that:
    (1) Effective liens are maintained at all times;
    (2) Taxes on the property included in the securing instruments are 
paid promptly to prevent such taxes from becoming a lien taking priority 
over a mortgage; and
    (3) Hazard and liability insurance is obtained and maintained in an 
amount sufficient to protect the security against the risks or hazards 
to which it may be subjected, to the extent customary in the locality.
Failure of a lender to discharge any of these responsibilities will 
diminish the amount of the guaranty or insurance to the extent of any 
loss caused by the lender's failure, unless there are extenuating 
circumstances which in the judgment of the Commissioner do not justify a 
reduction of the amount guaranteed or insured.


<R05>
Sec. 103.29  Property purchased with loan funds.

    (a) Lenders making guaranteed or insured loans which include funds 
to finance construction of buildings, or installation of water, sewage, 
electrical or gas lines shall assure that the site is appropriate and 
adequate; cost estimates are prepared and are in line with current 
costs; plans are prepared by qualified individuals or a firm; provisions 
are made to assure compliance with applicable building codes, zoning and 
labor laws; and inspections are made by qualified inspectors during 
construction and upon completion. Upon receiving applications involving 
funds to finance construction, lenders may request assistance and 
guidance from the Commissioner on such matters. The Commissioner may 
arrange for an inspection of any property purchased with guaranteed or 
insured loans at any reasonable time. Property which may be inspected 
includes proposed building sites, during and on completion of 
construction of buildings; electrical, sewage, water or gas lines; and 
livestock and machinery purchased with loan funds.
    (b) Lenders will require that any property purchased with a 
guaranteed or insured loan, except land purchased by a tribe, title to 
which is taken in trust or restricted status, be mortgaged to the lender 
as security for the loan, unless the loan is otherwise adequately 
secured.


<R05>
Sec. 103.30  Land.

    (a) Indian individuals may execute mortgages or deeds of trust on 
nontrust or unrestricted land as security without the approval of any 
Federal official.
    (b) Tribal land, title to which is held in a trust or restricted 
status, may not be mortgaged unless specifically authorized by Congress.
    (c) Individually-owned land held in trust or restricted status may 
be mortgaged as security for a loan in accordance with 25 CFR 152.34 and 
the Act of March 29, 1956 (70 Stat. 62; 25 U.S.C. 483a). Mortgages of 
individually held trust or restricted land will include only the acreage 
of the land owned by a borrower, which the Commissioner considers is 
adequate to protect the loan in case of default. Mortgages on 
individually held trust or restricted land shall be subject to 
foreclosure or sale pursuant to the terms of the mortgage. For the 
purposes of any foreclosure or sales proceedings, the owner shall be 
regarded as vested with an unrestricted fee simple title to the land.

[[Page 316]]

The United States shall not be a necessary party to the proceedings 
pursuant to the Act of March 29, 1956 (70 Stat. 62; 25 U.S.C. 483a). Any 
conveyance of the land pursuant to such proceedings shall divest the 
United States of title to the land. Trust or restricted land given as 
security for a loan shall not be sold or title otherwise transferred 
without giving the Commissioner and the tribe of the reservation on 
which the land is located, or is adjacent to, written notice, at least 
45 days in advance of the date of sale or proposed transfer of title.
    (d) Tribes, corporations, cooperative associations, partnerships, 
and Indian individuals leasing trust or restricted land may, when 
provided in the lease and approved by the lessor and the Commissioner, 
mortgage their leasehold interest in the leased premises for the purpose 
of borrowing capital for the development and improvement of the leased 
premises.

of any federal official. If a lender requires, the Commissioner may 
approve mortgages of trust or restricted chattels given to secure 
guaranteed or insured loans. A tribe must adhere to the provisions of 
its constitution, bylaws, charter, or other organizational documents in 
mortgaging chattels. Mortgaged chattels shall be subject to foreclosure 
or sale pursuant to the terms of the mortgage or security agreement in 
accordance with applicable laws.


<R05>
Sec. 103.32  Crop mortgages.

    Crops grown on leased trust or restricted land may be mortgaged as 
security for a loan with the approval of the lessor and the 
Commissioner. Individuals owning trust or restricted land may mortgage 
crops grown on such land as security for a loan with approval of the 
Commissioner. Crops grown on trust or restricted land after severance 
from the land and crops grown on nontrust and unrestricted land may be 
mortgaged as security without the approval of any Federal official.


<R05>
Sec. 103.33  Assignments of income.

    (a) A tribe or organization may execute assignments of trust income 
from specific sources as security for loans, pursuant to authorization 
in its constitution, bylaws, charter, or other organization papers. 
Tribes may not execute general assignments of trust income as security 
for loans. Assignments of trust income require approval by the 
Commissioner before becoming effective.
    (b) Assignments of income from the trust or restricted land of an 
Indian individual may be executed as security for loans with the 
approval of the Commissioner. However, restricted land of heirs or 
devisees of members of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma is subject 
to the jurisdiction of Oklahoma state courts under the Act of August 4, 
1947 (61 Stat. 73).


<R05>
Sec. 103.34  Restrictions.

    Unless the security for a loan requires approval of a federal 
official, no restrictions shall be placed by any official upon the 
security that may be given for a loan. Lenders will document any and all 
prior security interests of record with respect to proposed collateral. 
Lenders will use caution in making certain that the security taken is 
unencumbered. Lenders will follow the same prudent procedures as if the 
borrower were a non-Indian or a non-Indian organization.

<R05>
Sec. 103.35  Release of security.

    The prime security for a loan will not be released unless the 
property is sold and the net proceeds applied to the loan. When approved 
by the Commissioner, the prime security may be released when the 
property is sold and the proceeds are used to purchase property of 
similar nature and use and of at least equal value and lien priority as 
the property sold and when the lender, borrower and Commissioner agree 
that the sale and such use of the proceeds

[[Page 317]]

are necessary for the success of an economic enterprise. Lenders may 
release property which is planned to be sold in the regular course of a 
business when the proceeds are to be used for purposes which the lender 
determines are necessary and proper in connection with the type of 
economic enterprise involved. Releases of security involving trust 
income or trust or restricted land will require the prior approval of 
the Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 103.36  Default on guaranteed loans.

    (a) Within 45 calendar days after the occurrence of a default, the 
lender shall notify the Commissioner by certified or registered mail 
showing the name of borrower, guaranty certificate number, amount of 
unpaid principal, amount of principal delinquent, amount of interest 
accrued and unpaid to date of notice, amount of interest delinquent at 
time of notice, and other failure of the borrower to comply with 
provisions of the loan agreement. Within 60 calendar days after default 
on a loan, the lender shall proceed as prescribed in either paragraph 
(b), (c), or (d) of this section, unless an extension of time is 
requested by the lender and approved by the Commissioner. The request 
for an extension shall explain the reason why a delay is necessary and 
the estimated date on which action will be initiated. Failure of the 
lender to proceed with action within 60 calendar days or the date to 
which an extension is approved by the Commissioner shall cause the 
guaranty certificate to cease being in force or effect. If the 
Commissioner is not notified of the failure of a borrower to make a 
scheduled payment or of other default within the required 45 calendar 
days, the Commissioner will proceed on the assumption that the scheduled 
payment was made and that the loan agreement is current and in good 
standing. The Commissioner will then decrease the amount of the guaranty 
pro rata by the amount of the due installment and the lender will have 
no further claim for guaranty as it applied to the installment, except 
for the interest subsidy on guaranteed loans which may be due.
    (b) The lender may make written request that payment be made 
pursuant to the provisions of the guaranty certificate or guaranty 
agreement. If the Commissioner finds that a loss has been suffered, the 
lender may be paid the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed 
including unpaid interest.
    (c) The borrower and the lender may agree upon an extension of the 
repayment terms or other forbearance for the benefit of the borrower. 
The lender may extend all reasonable forbearance if the borrower becomes 
unable to meet the terms of a loan. However, such forbearance will not 
be extended if it will increase the likelihood of a loss on a loan. 
Agreements between a lender and a borrower shall be in writing and will 
require approval by the Commissioner.
    (d) The lender may advise the Commissioner in writing that suit or 
foreclosure is considered necessary and proceed to foreclosure and 
liquidation of all security interests. On completion of foreclosure and 
liquidation, if the Commissioner determines that a loss has been 
suffered, the lender will be reimbursed for the pro rata portion of the 
amount of unpaid principal and interest guaranteed. A lender will submit 
a claim for reimbursement for losses on a form furnished by the 
Commissioner and will furnish any additional information needed to 
establish the amount of the claim. On reimbursement of a lender for the 
pro rata amount of the loss guaranteed as provided in the guaranty 
certificate, the lender will subrogate its rights and interest in the 
loan to the United States and assign the loan obligations and security 
for the loan to the United States. The Commissioner may establish the 
date on which accrual of interest or charges shall cease. This date may 
not be later than the date of judgment and decree of foreclosure or 
sale. The Commissioner will take any action necessary to protect the 
interest of the United States.
    Subsequent to subrogation and assignment, any collections shall be 
for the account of the United States up to the amount paid on the 
guaranty plus any costs or expenses incurred by the United States. 
Collections will be deposited in the loan guaranty and insurance fund 
established pursuant to this part. Any amounts collected in excess of 
those necessary to reimburse the United States for amounts paid under

[[Page 318]]

the guaranty plus costs or expenses shall be paid to the lender up to 
the amount of the lender's losses. Any residue from collection shall go 
to the borrower.

<R05>
Sec. 103.37  Default on insured loans.

    Within 45 calendar days after the occurrence of a default of a loan 
made under the provisions of an insurance agreement, the lender shall 
notify the Commissioner by certified or registered mail giving the name 
of the borrower, insurance agreement number, amount of unpaid principal, 
amount of delinquent principal, accrued interest unpaid to date of 
notice, amount of delinquent interest and description of default. Within 
60 calendar days after default on an insured loan, the lender shall 
proceed as prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section unless it 
has requested, and the Commissioner has approved, an extension of time. 
A request for an extension of time will explain the necessity for an 
extension and the estimated date on which action will be initiated. 
Failure of the lender to proceed within 60 calendar days or the extended 
time approved by the Commissioner, will be grounds for the Commissioner 
to terminate the loan insurance on the loan involved.
    (a) The lender and borrower may agree upon an extension of the 
repayment terms of a loan or other forbearance for the benefit of the 
borrower. However, such forbearance will not be extended if it will 
increase the likelihood of a loss on a loan. Insured loans made under 
the provisions of a general insurance agreement authorizing a lender to 
make loans under the terms prescribed in the agreement will not require 
Commissioner approval of changes in agreements made by the lender and 
borrower. Provided, such changes are in compliance with the requirements 
of Sec. 103.21 and the applicable sections referred to therein. The 
lender shall immediately notify the Commissioner within 21 calendar days 
of changes made in the agreement. Insured loans made which originally 
required the issuance of a separate insurance agreement by the 
Commissioner will require Commissioner approval of changes in the 
provisions of such loans.
    (b) If an insured lender determines that proceeding under paragraph 
(a) of this section is contrary to its customary lending practices or is 
not in the interest of a borrower, it will be required to exhaust all 
reasonable efforts to collect the loan and to liquidate the security to 
the fullest extent feasible before submitting a claim for reimbursement 
of a loss.
    (c) If a lender proceeds under the provisions of paragraph (b) of 
this section and suffers a loss, it may submit a claim for reimbursement 
for unpaid principal and interest on a form furnished by the 
Commissioner and will furnish any additional information needed to 
establish the amount of the claim. Claims will be submitted to the 
Commissioner within 45 calendar days after completion of the procedures 
prescribed in this section. All claims shall be accompanied by evidence 
showing that all reasonable efforts to collect the loan have been 
exhausted and that security given for the loan has been liquidated to 
the extent feasible. If the Commissioner agrees that a loss has 
occurred, he will reimburse the lender pursuant to the terms of the 
approved insurance agreement under which the loan was insured. Upon 
reimbursement by the Commissioner to the lender in whole or in part for 
the loss insured, the note and security for the loan or judgment 
evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States. The lender 
shall have no further claim against the United States or the borrower. 
The Commissioner will then take such further collection action as may be 
warranted. The Commissioner may establish a date upon which accrual of 
interest or charges shall cease.


<R05>
Sec. 103.38  Subrogated and assigned rights.

    The Commissioner will take such action as he deemed appropriate to 
realize the maximum recovery upon the rights to which the United States 
is subrogated and the security assigned

[[Page 319]]

to the United States. Any amount collected will be deposited in the loan 
guaranty and insurance fund.

assigned to the United States or rights to which the United States is 
subrogated and the security assigned to the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 103.40  Charges upon liquidation.

    Lenders may charge the following against the gross amounts collected 
from the sale of security in determining the amounts to be claimed under 
a guaranty certificate or insurance agreement:
    (a) Reasonable and necessary expenses for preservation of the 
security.
    (b) Court and attorney costs in a foreclosure or proper judicial 
proceeding involving the security.
    (c) Other reasonable expenses necessary for collecting the debt or 
for repossession, protection, and liquidation of the security.
    (d) Other expenses or fees approved in advance by the Commissioner.
    (e) Accrued unpaid interest to the date of judgment and decree of 
foreclosure or sale, or the date established by the Commissioner that 
accrued interest shall cease pursuant to Secs. 103.36 and 103.37.


<R05>
Sec. 103.41  Interest.

    Interest rates charged by lenders on guaranteed and insured loans, 
exclusive of loan service charges, if any, shall not exceed such percent 
per annum on the principal obligation outstanding as the Commissioner 
determines to be reasonable and legal at the time a loan is guaranteed 
or insured, taking into account the range of rates prevailing in the 
private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United 
States. Each loan shall show the rate of interest to be charged. 
Interest shall be payable at least annually. Once a loan is closed the 
interest rate may not be increased except when a variable interest rate 
tied to a specified base rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender 
has been approved by the Commissioner. Lenders may not charge interest 
on loan funds used for payment of loan service charges.

<R05>
Sec. 103.42  Interest subsidy.

    (a) The Commissioner may pay an interest subsidy to lenders on loans 
which are guaranteed or insured under this part 103 at rates which are 
necessary to reduce the interest rate payable by the borrowers to a rate 
determined in accordance with title I, section 104, of the Indian 
Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-262, 83 Stat. 77). The rate of subsidy 
will be established by the Commissioner at the time of issuance of a 
guaranty certificate or insurance agreement on loans requiring approval 
by the Commissioner. Interest subsidy payments by the United States 
shall be discontinued on such loans if the lender elects to discontinue 
the guaranty or insurance or causes the termination of the guaranty or 
insurance by failure to make premium payments as required by 
Sec. 103.43, or when one of the following occurs:
    (1) The loan is paid in full prior to the expiration of the original 
term.
    (2) The loan is refinanced by a new loan.
    (3) The repayment schedule on the principal balance owing is 
extended beyond the original term, unless an exception is approved by 
the Commissioner. The interest subsidy shall only be discontinued as to 
the balance which has been extended beyond the original term of the 
loan.
    (4) The lender on a defaulted loan is reimbursed for a guaranteed or 
insured loss. The date of the check shall be the date of reimbursement.
    (5) Cash flow form the business being financed appears sufficient to 
pay for full debt service based on periodic review by the Commissioner. 
Cash flow shall be deemed sufficient to pay debt service when earnings 
before interest and taxes, after adjustments for extraordinary items, 
equal or exceed industry norms.

[[Page 320]]

    (b) The lender shall notify the Commissioner that he has made or 
modified an insured loan under the provisions of a general insurance 
agreement within 20 days of such action and provide the Commissioner 
with the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the borrower.
    (2) Tribal affiliation of the borrower.
    (3) Amount of the loan and purpose(s).
    (4) The repayment schedule.
    (5) The interest rate charged the borrower.
    (6) The date(s) funds were advanced.
    (c) After receiving notice from the lender, the Commissioner will 
establish the interest subsidy rate and notify the lender of the rate 
established. The Commissioner may establish procedures requiring lenders 
to provide reports which will expedite the prompt payment of interest 
subsidies. Interest subsidies will be paid on the unpaid principal 
balance owed by a borrower either annually, semiannually, quarterly or 
monthly, depending on the time interest is scheduled to be paid and as 
near the due date as feasible, but not before. Lenders shall notify the 
Commissioner promptly when borrowers pay interest or principal in 
advance of the due date(s) provided in the loan agreement. The interest 
subsidy rate established by the Commissioner will be in effect for three 
years. At the end of the third year the need for subsidy will be 
reviewed and extended on an annual basis for the next two years, if 
justified.

<R05>
Sec. 103.43  Premium charges.

    A premium of 2.0 percent of the guaranteed portion of a loan will be 
charged to lenders. The lender may increase the principal amount of the 
loan by the cost of the premium and charge it to the borrower. The 
lender shall pay the premium within 90 days of the date of approval of 
the loan guaranty. Existing lenders may elect to modify their Loan 
Guaranty and Insurance Agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs so 
as to pay future premium payments in a lump sum. If the guaranty premium 
is not paid within 90 days of approval of the loan guaranty or 
modification of the agreement, the Commissioner will send the lender a 
notice of non-payment. If the premium is not paid within 30 days of the 
receipt of this notice, the guaranty shall be subject to termination.

<R05>
Sec. 103.44  Other charges.

    Funds may be included in loans for payment of reasonable and 
customary costs for legal or architectural services, appraisals, 
surveys, compliance inspections, title searches, lien searches, 
recordation costs, hazard and liability insurance premiums, taxes and 
such other charges as the Commissioner may authorize at the time a loan 
is made. Loan service charges, if any, may be charged if authorized in 
the loan agreement. Funds included in a loan for payment of loan service 
charges may not bear interest pursuant to Sec. 103.41. Payment by the 
borrower of points, finders fees, loan origination fees, bonuses or 
commissions for loans guaranteed under this part is prohibited.

<R05>
Sec. 103.45  Late charge.

    Lenders may assess borrowers a late charge on any loan installment, 
principal only, received more than 30 days after its due date if the 
loan agreement at the time of approval contains an authorization to this 
effect. The rate shall be specified in the loan agreement. The amount of 
late charges assessed may not be guaranteed or insured. Interest may not 
be charged on late charges.


<R05>
Sec. 103.46  Loan servicing.

    (a) The guaranty or insurance of a loan by the Commissioner and the 
issuance of an insurance agreement will be based on the requirement that 
adequate loan servicing will be performed by the lender. Loan servicing 
will be without cost to the borrower, unless the Commissioner authorizes 
a charge at the time the loan is made pursuant to Sec. 103.44. 
Authorizations for such

[[Page 321]]

charges shall be in writing and included in the loan agreement. Lenders 
are expected to follow accepted standards employed by prudent lenders in 
the area in servicing similar type loans. In servicing loans, lenders 
will make every effort to prevent and minimize potential losses. Lenders 
will use prudence in disbursing loan funds to borrowers to assure, to 
the extent feasible, that loan funds are used only for the purposes for 
which the loan is made. Unless approved by the Commissioner, any amounts 
disbursed for purposes other than those provided in the loan agreement 
shall be excluded in the computing the amount for which the lender may 
be reimbursed in the event of a loss on a loan.
    (b) Loan servicing must meet the following standards regarding 
billing and documentation. Payments must be routinely invoiced, in most 
cases on a monthly basis. Invoices shall include the date the payment is 
due and the date the payment will be considered late (i.e., grace 
period). Borrowers should be encouraged to use pre-authorized debits or 
credit cards when making payments. Loan files must contain current 
information on payment history, including delinquencies and defaults, 
and any subsequent loan action concerning deferrals, refinancing, or 
rescheduling. There should be a record of the time and outcome of each 
contact with the borrower, including notification of delinquent status, 
requests for repayment, and intent to report the delinquent debt to 
credit bureaus or to refer debts to collection agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 103.47  Restrictions on lenders.

    Loan agreements shall not provide that the lender shall have the 
right to declare the indebtedness due, or to pursue one or more legal 
remedies, if the lender ``shall feel insecure''. This restriction shall 
not prevent a lender from taking action against a borrower due to any 
act or omission on the part of the borrower which, by the terms of a 
note, mortgage, or other loan document, would allow the lender to 
declare a loan in default, nor to take action to minimize the loss on a 
loan.


<R05>
Sec. 103.48  Title to property purchased with loans.

    Title to personal property purchased with a guaranteed or insured 
loan shall be taken in the name of the borrower without a restriction 
against alienation. Title to land purchased with a guaranteed or insured 
loan may be taken pursuant to Sec. 103.3. Transactions involving taking 
title to land purchases in trust or restricted status require approval 
of the Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 103.49  Fraud or misrepresentation.

    (a) Lenders shall use prudence in checking and verifying information 
contained in loan applications as well as supporting papers and 
documents in order to assure their accuracy and the validity of 
signatures.
    (b) There shall be no liability on the part of the United States to 
reimburse an insured lender for that portion of an insured loss on a 
loan caused by:
    (1) The lender's negligence in checking and verifying signatures, 
information in the loan application, supporting papers and documents;
    (2) The lender's furnishing false information to induce the issuance 
of an insurance agreement by the Commissioner;
    (3) The lender's furnishing false information in a loan docket on a 
loan made under the provisions of a general insurance agreement issued 
by the Commissioner; or
    (4) The lender's willful or negligent action which resulted in a 
fraud, forgery or misrepresentation.
    (c) There shall be no liability on the part of the United States to 
reimburse a lender on a guaranteed loan for that amount of the 
guaranteed loss caused by:
    (1) The lender's negligence in checking and verifying signatures, 
information in the loan application, supporting papers and documents;
    (2) The lender's furnishing false information to induce the issuance 
of a guaranty certificate by the Commissioner; or
    (3) The lender's willful or negligent action which permitted a 
fraud, forgery or misrepresentation.

[[Page 322]]

A reduction will not be made in the amount of reimbursement on a 
guaranteed loss to a purchaser, assignee, or transferee who acquired the 
loan before maturity for value and did not directly or by agent 
participate in or have prior knowledge of a fraud, forgery or 
misrepresentation.


<R05>
Sec. 103.50  Loan guaranty and insurance fund.

    (a) The loan guaranty and insurance fund shall be utilized for all 
loan guaranty and insurance operations pursuant to the regulations in 
this part 103. All receipts from operations including premium charges 
shall be deposited in this fund. All disbursements incident to 
administering guaranteed and insured loans shall be made from this fund. 
All cash, claims, notes, mortgages, contracts, and property acquired by 
the Secretary under this part 103 shall constitute assets of the fund. 
All liabilities and obligations of such assets shall be liabilities and 
obligations of the fund.
    (b) The Commissioner will design an accounting system that will 
reflect at all times the financial condition of the fund and the results 
from its operation.
    (c) Interest subsidies paid by the Commissioner pursuant to 
Sec. 103.42 shall be paid from the loan guaranty and insurance fund and 
charged against an ``interest subsidy account'' as an expense of the 
fund.


<R05>
Sec. 103.51  Sale or assignment of guaranteed loans.

     Any guaranteed loan, including the security and guaranty 
certificate, may be sold to any person. The person acquiring the loan 
shall notify the Commissioner in writing with 30 days after acquisition. 
The notice will give the name of the borrower, the certificate number, 
the amount of principal and interest unpaid on the loan, and the 
security acquired. Failure of the acquirer to notify the Commissioner 
within 30 days of acquisition will void the guaranty unless the 
Commissioner authorizes an exception because of extenuating 
circumstances.

    Lenders will maintain adequate records on guaranteed and insured 
loans made and will submit reports to keep the Commissioner informed 
regarding guaranteed and insured loans made. The Commissioner may

the forms to be used for reporting. The Commissioner may have the 
records of lenders inspected at any reasonable time during regular 
business days and hours.


<R05>
Sec. 103.53  Suspension of lenders.

    Whenever the Commissioner finds that any lender or holder of a 
guaranty certificate or insured loan fails to maintain adequate 
accounting records, to demonstrate proper ability to adequately service 
loans guaranteed or insured, or to exercise proper credit judgment, or 
has willfully or negligently engaged in practices detrimental to the 
interests of a borrower or of the United States, he may refuse, either 
temporarily or permanently, to guarantee or insure any additional loans 
made by such lender or certificate holder. He may also bar such lender 
or certificate holder from acquiring additional loans guaranteed under 
this part 103. However, the Commissioner shall not refuse to pay a valid 
guaranty or insurance claim on loans previously made in good faith.


<R05>
Sec. 103.54  Probate.

    (a) The estates of deceased borrowers who die possessed of trust 
property or funds and who gave as secruity for a guaranteed or insured 
loan an assignment of income from trust property, a mortgage or deed of 
trust on trust or restricted land, or a lien on trust chattels or crops 
growing on trust land will be probated in accordance with the applicable 
regulations in subpart D of 43 CFR part 4 and in parts 16 and 17 of 25 
CFR. The Superintendent or other Bureau official having jurisdiction

<R05>
Sec. 111.1  Persons to share payments.

    In making all annuity and other per capita payments, the funds shall 
be equally divided among the Indians entitled thereto share and share 
alike. The roll for such payments should be prepared on Form 5-322,\1\ 
in strict alphabetical order by families of husband, wife, and unmarried 
dependent minor children. Unless otherwise instructed,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Forms may be obtained from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
Washington, D.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Indians of both sexes may be considered adults at the age of 18 
years;
    (b) Deceased enrollees may be carried on the rolls for one payment 
after death;
    (c) Where final rolls have been prepared constituting the legal 
membership of the tribe, only Indians whose names appear thereon are 
entitled to share in future payments, after-born children being excluded 
and the shares of deceased enrollees paid to the heirs if determined or 
if not determined credited to the estate pending determination; and

[[Page 324]]

    (d) The shares of competent Indians will be paid to them directly 
and the shares of incompetents and minors deposited for expenditure 
under the individual Indian money regulations.

heirs and approval of wills, see part 15 and Secs. 11.30 through 11.32C 
of this chapter. For individual Indian money regulations, see part 115

<R05>
Sec. 111.2  Enrolling non-full-blood children.

    Where an Indian woman was married to a white man prior to June 7, 
1897, and was at the time of her marriage a recognized member of the 
tribe even though she left it after marriage and lived away from the 
reservation, the children of such a marriage should be enrolled--and, 
also in the case of an Indian woman married to a white man subsequent to 
the above date but who still maintains her affiliation with the tribe 
and she and her children are recognized members thereof; however, where 
an Indian woman by marriage with a white man after June 7, 1897, has, in 
effect, withdrawn from the tribe and is no longer identified with it, 
her children should not be enrolled. In case of doubt all the facts 
should be submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, D.C., 
for a decision.


<R05>
Sec. 111.3  Payments by check.

    All payments should be made by check. In making payments to 
competent Indians, each check should be drawn to the order of the 
enrollee and given or sent directly to him. Powers of attorney and 
orders given by an Indian to another person for his share in a payment 
will not be recognized. Superintendents will note in the ``Remarks'' 
column on the roll the date of birth of each new enrollee and the date 
of death of deceased annuitants.


<R05>
Sec. 111.4  Election of shareholders.

    An Indian holding equal rights in two or more tribes can share in 
payments to only one of them and will be required to elect with which 
tribe he wishes to be enrolled and to relinquish in writing his claims 
to payments to the other. In the case of a minor the election will be 
made by the parent or guardian.


<R05>
Sec. 111.5  Future payments.

    Indians who have received or applied for their pro rata shares of an 
interest-bearing tribal fund under the act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. 
1221; 25 U.S.C. 119, 121), as amended by the act of May 18, 1916 (39 
Stat. 128), will not be permitted to participate in future payments made 
from the accumulated interest.

<R05>
Sec. 112.1  Fee simple patentees.

    When the applicant has been granted a patent in fee or certificate 
of competency, that fact will be accepted as prima facie evidence of his 
competency, but in forwarding applications of this class the agent will 
give the date on which the patent was issued, report whether in his 
judgment the patentee has made proper use of his privileges and would 
make good use of his share of the tribal funds if paid to him, and make 
a specific recommendation for approval or disapproval of the 
application.

[[Page 325]]


<R05>
Sec. 112.2  Applicants who have received neither fee simple patents nor certificates of competency.

    In the case of an applicant who has received neither a fee simple 
patent nor a certificate of competency, the application must be 
accompanied by evidence which will establish the fact that he is capable 
of managing his own affairs. In forwarding applications of this class 
the superintendent will report fully, as follows:
    (a) Is the applicant living on this allotment? If so, is he making 
reasonable efforts to cultivate his land and to support himself and 
family? If he is not living on his allotment, what is his occupation?
    (b) Is any part of his allotment leased? If so, to what extent does 
he depend upon the rent therefrom to support himself and family?
    (c) Has the applicant been given the privilege of leasing his own 
lands; and if so, with what result?
    (d) Has he an interest in any inherited land? If he has sold or 
leased any inherited land, how has he managed the proceeds?
    (e) Is the applicant of good moral character?
    (f) Is he addicted to the use of intoxicants? And if so, does this 
habit, in the judgment of the agent, unfit him to make proper use of his 
share of the tribal funds?
    (g) What is his physical condition?
    (h) Is the applicant in debt? If so, to what extent and for what 
purpose was the debt incurred?
    (i) Has the applicant the necessary business qualifications to 
enable him to manage his own affairs?
    (j) Give such other information concerning the applicant as will aid 
the office in determining whether or not to approve his application.
    (k) Make a specific recommendation for the approval or disapproval 
of the application.


<R05>
Sec. 112.3  Applicants who are mentally or physically incapable of managing their affairs.

    Applications of this class must be accompanied by evidence that will 
establish the advisability of withdrawing the share. If the application 
is approved, the funds will be deposited to the credit of the Indian and 
handled as individual Indian money.
    In forwarding applications the agent will report fully as follows:
    (a) Sex and exact date of birth.
    (b) Identify the applicant by allotment and last annuity-roll 
numbers.
    (c) What is the actual physical condition of the applicant. If 
suffering from disease, submit certificate of physician if necessary to 
establish disability.
    (d) What is the actual mental condition of the applicant? Answer 
fully.
    (e) What are the material resources of the applicant?
    (f) What advantages will accrue to applicant by withdrawal of his or 
her share at this time?
    (g) Has it been explained to the applicant and does he understand 
that if the application is approved the funds will be deposited to his 
credit as individual Indian money to be expended under the supervision 
of the superintendent?
    (h) Make a specific recommendation for the approval or disapproval 
of the application.

<R05>
Sec. 112.4  Interest in pro rata shares not vested rights unless application approved.

    On November 6, 1908, the Secretary of the Interior decided, in 
effect, that the interest of an Indian in a pro rata share of a tribal 
fund does not vest in the Indian an inheritable property until after his 
application has been approved by the Secretary and an order signed by 
him segregating it from the tribal fund. Applications for shares of 
funds under this act may be made at any time, but in view of the 
Secretary's decision such applications should be forwarded to the Bureau 
by the superintendent as soon as they are completed and filed with him. 
Applications from those who are blind, decrepit, etc., must be made 
special and forwarded to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, D.C., 
as soon as possible.

[[Page 326]]


<R05>
Sec. 112.5  Basis of distribution; pro rata shares.

    In estimating the pro rata share of an individual, the last annuity 
payroll prior to July 1, or January 1 of each year will be taken as a 
basis of distribution. Where no payment has been made within 1 year, the 
last census, if taken within the year, will be the basis. If no census 
has been taken or payment made within a year, the last available 
record--either census or annuity roll will be used.


<R05>
Sec. 112.6  Disposition of pro rata share in event of applicant's death.

    In the event of the death of an applicant prior to the approval of 
his application by the Secretary of the Interior, the share to which he 
would have been entitled, if living, will revert to the tribe. In case 
of the death of an applicant after approval of his application and the 
signing by the Secretary of the Interior of an order for the segregation 
of his share, but before payment is made, his share will descend to his 
legal heirs and should be deposited to the credit of the estate pending 
formal determination thereof.
    Cross Reference: For regulations pertaining to the determinations of 
heirs and approval of wills, see part 15 and Secs. 11.30 through 11.32C 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 112.7  Pro rata shares of minors.

    The shares of minors will not be withdrawn except when necessary for 
their own benefit. The application should be signed by the parent or 
guardian and transmitted to the Bureau by the superintendent with his 
recommendation as in other cases and a full explanation of the 
circumstances which justify the withdrawal. Such shares will be 
deposited to the credit of the minors subject to expenditure under the 
individual Indian money regulations. The term ``minor,'' as used in this 
section, shall be interpreted in conformity with the State law.

<R05>
Sec. 114.1  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of these regulations is to set forth the conditions 
governing the deposit, investment, and distribution of interest on funds 
held by the Bureau in special deposits; and to provide procedures 
required for determination of ownership and distribution of funds which 
are on deposit in account 14X6703 ``Indian Moneys Proceeds of Labor 
Escrow Account--Pending Determination of Ownership''.


<R05>
Sec. 114.2  Definitions.

    (a) ``Agency'' means any field office of the Bureau officially 
designated as an Indian agency and which provides direct services at the 
local level to Indians and Indian tribes, who are recognized by the 
Bureau as eligible for federal services to Indians because of their 
status as Indians.
    (b) ``Agency IMPL Escrow Account'' means that portion of the funds 
in 14X6703 identifiable to that agency.
    (c) ``Beneficiary'' means a potential beneficiary who has signed an 
acceptance.
    (d) ``Bureau'' or ``BIA'' means the Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
Department of the Interior.
    (e) ``Claimant'' means an individual (or a tribe) who asserts an 
entitlement to a share of the IMPL Escrow Account but has not been 
determined as a potential beneficiary.
    (f) ``IMPL Escrow Account'' means account 14X6703, Indian Moneys, 
Proceeds of Labor Escrow Account--Pending Determination of 
Beneficiaries, U.S. Treasury.
    (g) ``Potential beneficiary'' means an individual or tribe 
determined eligible to share in the IMPL Escrow Account provided a 
proper acceptance is received on behalf of the individual or tribe 
involved.
    (h) ``Principal account'' means each separate payment or deposit of 
money

[[Page 327]]

to the Bureau which is held as a special deposit.
    (i) ``Special deposit'' means any suspense account used for the 
temporary deposit of funds which cannot be credited to specific accounts 
or readily distributed, including, but not limited to:
    (1) Advance deposits;
    (2) Advance deposits on other leases and permits for such Indian 
lands;
    (3) Advance payments and advance deposits required on sales of 
timber and other natural resources from such Indian lands;
    (4) Deposits for rights of way over such Indian lands and 
anticipated right-of-way damages held until such damages are determined; 
and
    (5) Deposits for grazing fees on such Indian lands.
    (j) ``Special deposit funds'' means those funds held in special 
deposits.
    (k) ``Superintendent'' means the Bureau official in charge of a 
Bureau agency.


<R05>
Sec. 114.3  Investment of special deposit funds.

    It is the policy of the Bureau to invest all special deposit funds 
which have been paid to the Bureau on behalf of Indians or Indian tribes 
pending the eventual payment for the sale, lease, or other transfer of 
tribal or individual Indian property and funds which are deposited 
solely for the purpose of guaranteeing performance.


<R05>
Sec. 114.4  Payment and distribution of interest on special deposit funds.

    (a) It is the general policy of the Bureau that interest and 
earnings from the investment of special deposit funds be credited to the 
principal accounts upon which the interest was earned.
    (b) At the time that a withdrawal is made from a special deposit 
account, the interest earned by the principal account being withdrawn 
will be computed and withdrawn from the account as a part of the same 
transaction. The interest earned by the subject principal amount will be 
computed into two parts:
    (1) The portion of interest credited during the prior interest 
period which was attributable to this principal, and
    (2) The portion of interest which has been earned by this principal 
amount but has not yet been credited to the account because the interest 
period is not complete. This will be computed by using the month-end 
balances since the last interest period times the last period's factor.
    (c) No interest will be distributed to accounts which have less than 
the minimum average month-end balances as determined by the Division of 
Accounting Management. Any such interest not distributed would remain in 
the undistributed interest account at the Bureau level to be included in 
determining the next six month interest factor.


<R05>
Sec. 114.5  Distribution of IMPL Escrow Account.

    (a) Determination of potential beneficiaries. Each agency will 
determine the potential beneficiaries and their respective shares of the 
IMPL Escrow Account at that agency by the following method:
    (1) Identify the unobligated balance in the agency IMPL account as 
of September 30, 1982, and interest accrued for the period ending 
September 30, 1982, which has subsequently been transferred into account 
14X6703 IMPL Escrow Account Pending Determination of Ownership. This 
amount will be called the agency IMPL Escrow Account balance.
    (2)(i) Identify the length of time which has been required to 
accumulate actual income into the former IMPL account to equal the 
current agency IMPL Escrow Account balance.
    (ii) To determine the beginning date for ownership computations, 
subtract the length of time identified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section from April 1, 1981. (Subsequent to April 1, 1981, interest 
earned on special deposits has been credited directly to each special 
deposit account rather than to an IMPL account.)
    (3) Examine the Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts to determine 
the total dollars transferred to each account from the principal in 
special deposit accounts during the period identified in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (4) Examine tribal treasury account records to determine the total 
dollars transferred to each tribal trust account from the principal in 
special deposit

[[Page 328]]

accounts during the period identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (5) Determine the percentage of the principal transferred from 
special deposit accounts into each IIM and tribal trust account. This is 
done by dividing the total amount of principal transferred from special 
deposit accounts into all accounts at the agency into the total computed 
for each IIM and tribal trust account pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3) and 
(a)(4) of this section. The formula is as follows:

                                                                                                                
                                          Dollars transferred into an                                           
                                                    account                 Percent                             
                                         -----------------------------  =    share                              
                                           Total dollars transferred       for that                             
                                          by agency into all accounts       account                             
                                                                                                                

    (6) Multiply this percentage by the agency IMPL Escrow Account 
balance to determine each potential beneficiary's share of that balance. 
Should this determined share be less than ten dollars ($10.00) no 
transfer of funds will be made.
    (7) The formula identified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section will 
be used in determining potential shares unless there are clear and 
available records at the agency level to identify specific amounts. If 
the records are used by the agencies they must be made available for 
public review upon request.
    (b) Notification of determination of potential beneficiaries. Upon 
completion of the determination of all potential beneficiaries of an 
agency IMPL Escrow Account, the Superintendent shall publish a general 
notice which shall contain the following:
    (1) Brief history of agency IMPL Escrow Account;
    (2) Explanation of method of determination of potential 
beneficiaries;
    (3) Information on availability of specific data;
    (4) Instruction to potential beneficiaries on completion of 
acceptance forms, explaining that only those who complete the acceptance 
forms can receive any funds; and
    (5) Establishment of deadline date by which potential beneficiaries 
must complete the acceptance forms to receive the funds. This deadline 
will be 180 days from the date of the general notice. This general 
notice shall be published in the usual and customary manner for making 
public such documents. If such usual and customary publication does not 
include posting on the agency bulletin board and publication in at least 
one local newspaper of general distribution, the posting on the bulletin 
board and local newspaper publication shall be done in addition to the 
usual and customary manner of publication.
    (c) Acceptance by potential beneficiary. Before the funds identified 
in paragraph (a) of this section as transferable to a potential 
individual or tribal beneficiary can be deposited into that potential 
beneficiary's account the following must be completed:
    (1) The potential beneficiary must sign an acceptance of the 
determination by the Secretary which shall constitute a complete release 
and waiver of any and all claims by the potential beneficiary against 
the United States relating to the unobligated balance of IMPL accounts 
as of the close of business on September 30, 1982.
    (2) The acceptance must be signed during the 180 days between the 
date of the general notice provided for in paragraph (b) of this section 
and the deadline date established therein.
    (3) In the case of a potential tribal beneficiary, the acceptance 
must be accompanied by a resolution of the appropriate tribal entity 
approving the acceptance and authorizing the designated tribal 
representative(s) to sign the acceptance. An acceptance on behalf of an 
estate account may be signed by the Superintendent if the determination 
of heirs has not become final and may be signed on behalf of individual 
inherited shares by each heir if the probate determination has become 
final. An acceptance on behalf of a minor may be signed by a parent, 
guardian or a person acting in loco parentis. An acceptance on behalf of 
an adult who has been determined legally incompetent or in need of 
assistance in managing his/her affairs pursuant to 25 CFR 115.9 may be 
signed by his/her authorized representative.
    (d) Distribution. (1) After the expiration of the deadline 
established in paragraph (b) of this section, funds of

[[Page 329]]

individual beneficiaries who have completed the acceptance forms will be 
transferred from the IMPL Escrow Account into each beneficiary's IIM 
account. Funds derived from beneficiary estate accounts for which the 
heirs have been determined will be transferred into the heirs' accounts. 
Funds derived from beneficiary estate accounts for which the heirs have 
not been determined will be transferred into the estate account.
    (2) Interest accrued for any period after October 1, 1982 will be 
credited to the beneficiary accounts on the same percentage basis as the 
original share.
    (3) After the expiration of the deadline established in paragraph 
(b) of this section, funds of a tribal beneficiary and interest earned 
thereon since October 1, 1982, will be transferred into the appropriate 
tribal treasury account.
    (4) Not more than ten percent (10%) of the funds which may be 
transferred to a trust account for any tribe, or to an IIM account for 
an individual, may be utilized by the beneficiary to pay for legal or 
other representation relating to claims for such funds.
    (5) Not more than two percent (2%) of the funds which may be 
transferred to a trust account for any tribe, or to an IIM account for 
an individual, may be utilized by the BIA to reimburse the BIA for 
administrative expenses incurred in determining ownership of the funds.
    (e) Appeals. (1) Any potential beneficiary or claimant may appeal 
any decision made or action taken by a Superintendent under this 
section. Such appeal shall be made in writing and submitted as provided 
in 25 CFR part 2.
    (2) As provided in part 2, the appeal must be received within 30 
days after receipt of the written notice advising the potential 
beneficiary of his/her share of the IMPL Escrow Account or advising the 
claimant that no share has been determined for him/her. No appeals will 
be accepted under this section after September 30, 1985.
    (f) Distribution of residual funds. (1) After final administrative 
determination of ownership, including final determination of all 
appeals, and the completion of all appropriate fund transfers, but not 
later than October 1, 1985, any funds remaining in an agency IMPL Escrow 
Account may be expended subject to the approval of the Secretary for any 
purpose authorized under the Act of November 2, 1921 (42 Stat. 208; 25 
U.S.C. 13), and requested by the governing body(s) of the tribe(s) at 
the location(s) where such agency IMPL Escrow Account is maintained. 
This authority to expend the escrow account funds ends September 30, 
1987.
    (2) The unobligated balances of all IMPL Escrow Accounts as of the 
close of business on September 30, 1987, shall be deposited into 
miscellaneous receipts of the U.S. Treasury.

<R05>

acceptable corporate surety bond in an amount equal to the value of the 
trust as fixed and determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
Appraisers will be appointed by the Secretary for the purpose of fixing 
the value of the trust and of revising such value from time to time as 
the judgment of the Secretary may dictate. Additional or substitute 
security may be required at any time when deemed necessary for the 
protection of the trust estate and the interest of the Indians. Trustees 
pledging United States bonds or notes as security shall execute on forms 
\1\ prescribed by the Secretary an appropriate resolution and power of 
attorney authorizing the sale, assignment or transfer of the collateral. 
Only those corporate sureties who hold certificates of authority from 
the Secretary of the Treasury to write bonds on which the United States 
is obligee are acceptable as sureties. The cost to the trustee, if any, 
of furnishing the required bond, will be regarded as a necessary part of 
the cost of administering the trust and as such deductible from the 
gross income accruing therefrom.

of the corpus of the trust estate, to be paid out of the income first 
accruing therefrom, and not to exceed an amount equal to 2 percent of 
the corpus of the estate at the time of final distribution based upon 
the last valuation made by the Secretary of the Interior prior to such 
distribution. By final distribution is meant any distribution to a 
beneficiary of any part of the corpus of the trust estate at any time 
under the terms of the trust. All fees are to be based on the size of 
the trust and the nature of the duties to be performed thereunder. The 
foregoing percentage of fees are maximum and alternative, that is, 
within such maximum limitations any one or more of said fees may or may 
not be allowed within the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>

    In addition to the form of application by the Indians under the act 
of January 27, 1933 (47 Stat. 777), there are skeleton forms of trust

Sec. 117.2  Payment of taxes of adult Indians.

    The superintendent may cause to be paid out of any money heretofore 
accrued or hereafter accruing to the credit of any adult Indian all 
taxes of every kind and character for which such Indian is or may be 
liable before paying to or for such person any funds as required by law. 
All checks in payment of taxes shall be made payable to the proper 
collector. For the purpose of establishing a fund with which to meet the 
payment of such taxes when due, the Superintendent may cause the funds 
of an adult Indian to be hypothecated in the following manner:
    (a) For the payment of ad valorem taxes, one-fourth of the estimated 
amount ad valorem taxes from each quarterly payment unless this 
procedure would cause the obligation of more than 25 percent of such 
quarterly payments, in which event the necessary additional funds shall 
be retained from other allowance funds payable to such person under the 
law. If there be no other allowance funds available, or if the funds 
from these sources are insufficient, one-fourth of the estimated amount 
of such ad valorem taxes may be obligated from each quarterly payment. 
If an Indian who is liable for ad valorem taxes has no allowance funds, 
or such funds are insufficient for the payment thereof, surplus funds 
may be used for such payment.
    (b)(1) For the payment of income taxes, one-half of the estimated 
amount of income taxes from each semi-annual payment of interest on 
deposits, but if such interest payments are insufficient to meet this 
obligation, additional funds shall be retained from interest on 
investments, rentals, or other allowance funds.
    (2) Whenever funds are withheld for the purpose of establishing a 
fund to meet the payment of taxes, the Indian shall be notified of the 
action taken.

parents or parent. If the parents are separated, the balance shall be

All other taxes for which an Indian under 21 years of age may be liable 
shall be paid from his surplus funds.

executed by the Indian and may disburse the allowance funds of the 
Indian in conformity therewith so long as the power of attorney remains 
in force and effect.


<R05>
Sec. 117.5  Procedure for hearings to assume supervision of expenditure of allowance funds.

    You are entitled to employ an attorney to assist you in this matter. 
Upon your request the employees of the Osage Agency will furnish you 
with any information you desire concerning your accounts at the Osage

$1 million and any funds that revert to the Osage Tribe and except the 
amount allowed for attorney fees and expenses and the cost of

<R05>
Sec. 121.3  Notice of time limit and place for filing claims.

    The act provides for distribution of funds to allottees and heirs of 
Osage Indian blood of deceased allottees.
    (a) All claims for per capita shares by heirs of Osage Indian blood 
shall be filed with the Superintendent, Osage Agency, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, Pawhuska, Okla. 74056, not later than April 27, 1974. An 
individual who claims as an heir of Osage Indian blood should make a 
timely filing of a claim which identifies, by name and allotment number, 
each allottee in whose share the individual claims an interest, in order 
that the Superintendent may notify the individual when the order of 
distribution for each such allottee is made. Failure to file a claim in 
this manner may prevent an individual from receiving notice of 
distribution in an instance in which he is an interested party. Failure 
of an heir of Osage Indian blood to file a claim will not necessarily 
prevent the distribution to such heir of the portion of the allottee's 
share due that heir if sufficient evidence to support such distribution 
is available to the Superintendent.

[[Page 345]]

However, no heir who fails to file a claim within the prescribed period 
(on or before April 27, 1974) shall after that period have any right to 
any distribution other than that ordered by the Superintendent based on 
evidence available to the Superintendent during that period. Unclaimed 
shares of distributees are required by statute to revert to the Osage 
Tribe 6 months after determination of their right to share.
    (b) Distribution of a living allottee's own share will be made 
without the filing of a claim.


<R05>
Sec. 121.4  Issuance of Orders of Distribution.

    The Superintendent, Osage Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
Pawhuska, Okla. 74056, is authorized to issue the Orders of Distribution 
in accordance with the act and the regulations in this part. The 
Superintendent's decisions thereon shall be final unless a timely appeal 
therefrom is filed in accordance with Sec. 121.8.


<R05>
Sec. 121.5  Segregation of per capita shares.

    The Superintendent shall segregate one per capita share for each 
allottee for distribution as follows:
    (a) One share for distribution to each such allottee who is living 
on the date the Order for Distribution for that share is issued; and
    (b) One share for distribution to the heir or heirs of Osage Indian 
blood of each allottee who is deceased on the date the Order of 
Distribution for that share is issued, to be divided among such heirs in 
such proportions as shall be computed in accordance with Sec. 121.6.


<R05>
Sec. 121.6  Distribution of share of deceased allottee.

    The Superintendent shall issue an Order of Distribution which, 
except as otherwise provided in this Sec. 121.6, divides the share of a 
deceased allottee leaving heirs of Osage Indian blood in such 
proportions as the allottee's heirs of Osage Indian blood would have 
shared in the estate of the allottee if the allottee had died intestate 
leaving one or more individuals of Osage Indian blood as the allottee's 
only heirs at law under the Oklahoma law of intestate succession. In 
preparing such an order, the Superintendent shall accept as accurate any 
unambiguous determination of heirship, of an allottee or of the heir of 
an allottee, either made by the Secretary prior to April 18, 1912, or 
contained in a final order of an Oklahoma court after that date. When no 
such unambiguous determination is available, such order shall be based 
upon all other pertinent heirship evidence available to the 
Superintendent. When one or more of the immediate heirs of Osage Indian 
blood of an allottee is deceased, the heirs of Osage Indian blood of 
such deceased heirs shall be ascertained, successively among all remote 
heirs of Osage Indian blood of the allottee, in the sequence in which 
the deaths of the heirs occurred until the identities of all living 
remote heirs of Osage Indian blood, and the respective proportions of 
the share to which they are entitled, have been ascertained. To qualify 
for distribution as an heir, it must be established that the distributee 
and each heir of the allottee through whom the claim is traced had Osage 
Indian blood acquired either from an allottee or from a common ancestor 
of an allottee and the distributee.


<R05>
Sec. 121.7  Notice of orders to claimants and distributees.

    Notice of an Order of Distribution shall be mailed, on the date of 
issuance of such order, to the allottee whose share is being distributed 
if living, but if not living, to (a) each distributee named therein, (b) 
each claimant whose claim asserts entitlement to a portion of the 
allottee's share, and (c) each person who had not filed a claim on the 
date of issuance of such order but is in that order determined by the 
Superintendent to be ineligible to receive a portion of the allottee's 
share. Such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the Order of 
Distribution and shall contain instructions for filing an appeal in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) and (c) of Sec. 121.8.


<R05>
Sec. 121.8  Appeal from an Order of Distribution.

    (a) An Order of Distribution of the share of an allottee living on 
the date the order is issued shall become final 3 days from the date 
thereof unless an

[[Page 346]]

appeal is filed by an interested party with the Superintendent before 
the expiration of those 3 days.
    (b) An Order of Distribution of the share of an allottee who is 
deceased on the date the order is issued shall become final 30 days from 
the date thereof unless an appeal is filed by an interested party with 
the Superintendent before the expiration of those 30 days.
    (c) Each appeal must contain a statement of the reasons that the 
appellant considers the Order of Distribution to be subject to error, 
and each appellant must, at the time of filing his appeal, mail a copy 
thereof to each person named as a distributee in the Order of 
Distribution. The Superintendent shall furnish a copy of the appeal to 
each other interested party to whom a copy of the Order of Distribution 
was mailed.
    (d) The Regional Solicitor, Tulsa, is authorized to determine 
appeals from Orders of Distribution in accordance with the act and the 
regulations in this part. The Regional Solicitor's decision thereon 
shall be final on the date of the issuance of his decision and shall 
constitute the final action of the Department of the Interior in 
connection with such appeal.
    (e) The Superintendent may, in his discretion for good cause shown, 
order partial distribution of any undisputed segment of any share for 
which an appeal is pending when such distribution will not be affected 
by the appeal decision on the disputed portion of the share.

<R05>
Sec. 121.9  Disbursement of distributed shares.

    When an Order of Distribution, either as issued or as amended by 
decision on appeal, has become final, the Superintendent shall either 
disburse to distributees the amounts distributed to them or deposit such 
amounts to appropriate accounts, in accordance with the following 
guidelines:
    (a) When the amount distributed to any heir is less than $20, the 
amount shall be segregated in a special account for that heir until all 
Orders of Distribution have become final, at which time the sum of all 
amounts thus segregated to such account shall be disbursed or 
redeposited as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this 
section, if such sum equals or exceeds $20. When such sum is less than 
$20, such sum in each of such accounts, and all unclaimed shares, and 
all amounts awarded to distributees which remain unclaimed for 6 months 
after the Order of Distribution has become final, shall, subsequent to 
April 27, 1974, be deposited to the account of the Osage Tribe as sums 
which have reverted to it.
    (b) Living allottees having certificates of competency shall have 
their distributions disbursed directly to them.
    (c) Living allottees not having certificates of competency shall 
have their distributions deposited to their accounts, subject to 
withdrawal by them at their request.
    (d) Heirs of Osage Indian blood who are at least 18 years of age and 
are not under guardianship shall have their distributions disbursed 
directly to them.
    (e) Heirs of Osage Indian blood who are under guardianship shall 
have their distributions deposited to their accounts, subject to 
disbursement to the distributees or their guardians or other persons on 
their behalf on such terms and conditions as the Superintendent shall 
consider to be in their best interests during their legal disability, 
after which the remaining portion shall be disbursed to such 
distributees.
    (f) Heirs of Osage Indian blood who are under 18 years of age shall 
have their distributions deposited to their accounts, with the funds 
represented by such deposits invested at favorable rates of return for 
prudent investments, to be disbursed with earnings thereon only when the 
respective distributees for whom they are held shall attain the age of 
18 years.


<R05>
Sec. 121.10  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Powers of attorney, assignments, and orders given to another 
person by anyone entitled to share in the payment will not be 
recognized.
    (b) None of the funds distributed are subject to Federal or State 
income taxes.

assignment; and the date of the Assistant Secretary's recognition.


<R05>
Sec. 123.6  Sub-assignment.

    (a) Nothing in the regulations in this part shall prohibit an 
assignee from making a valid sub-assignment of a Regional Corporation's 
rights to receive payments from the Fund. However, the Assistant 
Secretary has no authority and shall not recognize any sub-assignment by 
the assignee of any future interest of a Regional Corporation in the 
Fund.
    (b) The Assistant Secretary may accept a re-designation of a new 
payee of an assignment recognized by the Assistant Secretary, upon 
application of an authorized official of the assignee in accordance with 
Sec. 123.3(c).


<R05>
Sec. 123.7  Multiple assignments.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary may recognize more than one assignment 
of a Regional Corporation's future interests

[[Page 352]]

in the Fund. A second or later assignment of a Regional Corporation's 
future interest in the Fund, when recognized in accordance with 
Sec. 123.4, shall be recognized subject to assignments already 
recognized.
    (b) The Assistant Secretary shall not recognize an assignment of a 
Regional Corporation's future interest in the Fund if he has more than 
one outstanding application from that Corporation seeking recognition of 
such future interests. If more than one application from a Regional 
Corporation is pending before the Assistant Secretary, he shall notify 
both the Regional Corporation and the assignees of the assignments 
sought to be recognized, and seek a written consensus on the priorities 
to be established. In the Absence of such a consensus, the Assistant 
Secretary shall not recognize any such assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 123.8  Disclaimer.

    The Assistant Secretary does not guarantee by any action taken 
pursuant to the regulations in this part that the entitlement of a 
Regional Corporation to any quarterly distribution of the Fund shall be 
of any given amount, or that the cumulative entitlement of that 
Corporation will reach any given sum.


<R05>
Sec. 123.9  Cancellation of assignments.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary shall cancel his recognition of an 
assignment upon joint application of the assignee and Regional 
Corporation involved. Such application must include a resolution of the 
Board of Directors of the Regional Corporation, and a validly executed 
agreement between the Regional Corporation and assignee cancelling the 
assignment and authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to cancel his 
recognition of the assignment.
    (b) Such cancellation of recognition of an assignment shall be 
reflected in the register compiled by the Assistant Secretary as 
provided in Sec. 123.5.


<R05>
Sec. 123.10  Decision; finality.

    (a) A decision of the Assistant Secretary not to recognize an 
assignment of a future interest in the Fund shall inform the Regional 
Corporation what defects, if any, remain in its application for 
recognition, and shall provide the corporation with an opportunity to 
cure those defects.
    (b) A decision of the Assistant Secretary to recognize an assignment 
of a Regional Corporation's future interest in the Fund shall not be 
subject to reconsideration or administrative appeal, and shall therefore 
be final for the Department.

<R05>
Sec. 124.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations in this part is to describe the 
procedures to be used by all Departments and Agencies of the Federal 
Government and the State of Alaska for the deposit of proceeds derived 
from contracts, leases, permits, and rights-of-way or easements 
pertaining to affected lands or resources in affected lands withdrawn 
for Native selection pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act.


<R05>
Sec. 124.2   Proceeds received by Federal agencies.

    (a) Direct deposits. (1) Agency will prepare Deposit Ticket (SF 
215), using Agency Accounting Station Code 14-20-0650.
    (2) In Block (6) Fund Symbol 14X6140 will be inserted as well as the 
following:

Credit to Bureau of Indian Affairs, Branch of Finance and Accounting, 
P.O. Box 127, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103.
    (3) Memorandum copy and confirmed copy of Deposit Ticket will be 
mailed to above address, immediately upon completion and confirmation.
    (4) Agency will provide information (lease, contract or other 
identification) which will permit depositing agency to

[[Page 353]]

identify deposit with particular plot of land at time distribution of 
the funds is to be made. This information can be shown in Block (6) if 
space permits, or on an attached listing.
    (b) Periodic deposits. (1) In some circumstances, collection from 
Withdrawn Lands will be in such small amounts and such frequency as to 
be administratively burdensome to make individual deposits to the fund, 
or collections may be mixed with collections to be credited to other 
funds. In such instances depositing agencies may initially deposit the 
collections to their own suspense accounts. Such deposits will then be 
transferred to Fund 14X6140 no less frequently than monthly. The ``Pay 
to'' side of the SF 1081 will be completed as follows:

Department, Interior.
Bureau, Indian Affairs.
Agency Station Symbol, 14-20-0650.

Appropriation or Fund Symbol, 14X6140.

and will be supported by sufficient detail to permit future 
identification by depositing agency. An advance copy of the SF 1081, 
with supporting documentation will be forwarded to the BIA at 
Albuquerque immediately.
    (2) Agencies not using the SF 1081 procedures will issue a check 
made payable to the Treasurer of the United States, and forward it to:

Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, P.O. Box 8000--B, Juneau, 
Alaska 99802.

accompanied by a listing in sufficient detail to permit the collecting 
agency to identify the collections with each parcel of land at the time 
distribution of the funds is to be made.


<R05>
Sec. 124.3  Proceeds received by the State of Alaska.

    The State agency responsible for making collections will deposit the 
proceeds to the credit of the State of Alaska. A check will then be 
issued, payable to the Treasurer of the United States, and will be 
forwarded to the Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
accompanied by a detailed listing providing information which will 
permit identification of the funds with each particular parcel of land 
at the time distribution of the funds is to be made. The Juneau Area 
Office will deposit all such receipts to the credit of Fund Symbol 
14X6140, forwarding the memorandum copy to the Branch of Finance and 
Accounting immediately, together with a copy of the detail provided by 
the State of Alaska.

and are dependent upon the applicant for all or part of their support.


<R05>
Sec. 125.4  Eligibility.

    (a) Allotted Sioux Indians. The eligibility of allotted Sioux 
Indians for Sioux benefits is governed by the Act of March 2, 1889, c. 
405, Sec. 17, 25 Stat. 888, 895; the Act of June 10, 1896, c. 398, 29 
Stat. 321, 334; and the Act of May 21, 1928, c. 662, 45 Stat. 984. The 
Act of June 18, 1934, c. 576 Sec. 14, 48 Stat. 987, 25 U.S.C. 474, is 
inapplicable to any Sioux Indian to whom an allotment of land has been 
made under the provisions of the Act of May 29, 1908, c. 216, Sec. 19, 
35 Stat. 444, 451, or any prior federal statute. Under the applicable 
statutes, an allotted Sioux Indian is eligible for Sioux benefits if--
    (1) He/she received a valid allotment of land under the provisions 
of the Act of May 29, 1908, c. 216, Sec. 19, 35 Stat. 444, 451, or any 
prior Federal statute (regardless of whether such allotment is still 
held by the applicant);
    (2) He/she is either a single person over the age of eighteen (18) 
years or a head of a family (as provided in Sec. 125.4(c));
    (3) He/she has duly made application for Sioux benefits, and such 
application has been approved during his/her lifetime (as provided in 
Sec. 125.5); and
    (4) He/she has not previously been paid Sioux benefits in his/her 
own right (as provided in Sec. 125.4(d)).
    (b) Unallotted Sioux Indians. The Act of June 18, 1934, c. 576, 
Sec. 14, 48 Stat. 987, 25 U.S.C. 474, applies only to Sioux Indians who, 
but for the provisions of section 1 of that Act, 25 U.S.C. 461, would 
have been eligible for an allotment of land under the provisions of the 
Act of May 29, 1908, c. 216, Sec. 19, 35 Stat. 444, 451, or any prior 
Federal statute, and have not, in fact, been allotted lands under the 
provisions of such Federal statutes. That Act has current application 
only to unallotted members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe because of 
the proviso that the payment of Sioux benefits under that Act would 
continue only until such time as the lands available for allotment on 
each reservation as of June 18, 1934, would have been exhausted by the 
allotment of eighty (80) acres of land to each person receiving Sioux 
benefits under that Act. Under this statute a member of the Cheyenne 
River Sioux Tribe is eligible for Sioux benefits if--
    (1) He/she would be eligible, but for the provisions of the Act of 
June 18, 1934, c. 576, Sec. 1, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U.S.C. 461, for an 
allotment of land under the provisions of the Act of May 29, 1908, c. 
216, Sec. 19, 35 Stat. 444, 451, or any prior Federal statute, and has 
not been allotted lands under the provisions of such Federal statutes;
    (2) He/she is either a single person over the age of eighteen (18) 
years or a head of a family (as provided in Sec. 125.4(c));
    (3) He/she has duly made application for Sioux benefits and such 
application has been approved during his/her lifetime (as provided in 
Sec. 125.5);
    (4) He/she has not previously been paid Sioux benefits in his/her 
own right (as provided in Sec. 125.4(d)); and

[[Page 355]]

    (5) The hypothetical allotment of 80 acres of tribal land to the 
applicant would not exhaust the lands available for allotment on the 
Cheyenne River Indian Reservation as of June 18, 1934, considering the 
allowance of similar hypothetical allotments to other such Indians 
previously receiving Sioux benefits under such Act.
    (c) Head of a family. The following criteria apply in determining 
head of family status under both Secs. 125.4(a) and 125.4(b).
    (1) Except as provided in Sec. 125.4(c)(2), when an applicant for 
Sioux benefits is married and living with his/her spouse, the applicant 
will be deemed to be a head of a family if designated as such by both 
the applicant and his/her spouse.
    (2) When an applicant for Sioux benefits is married and living with 
his/her spouse, but the applicant's spouse (i) does not concur in the 
applicant's designation as head of the family, or (ii) has previously 
received Sioux benefits as head of the family which includes the 
applicant, the applicant will be deemed to be a head of a family if the 
economic contribution to the support of the family attributable to the 
applicant exceeds the contribution by his/her spouse for the eighteen 
(18) months period immediately preceding the date of the application for 
Sioux benefits.
    (3) When an applicant for Sioux benefits is (i) unmarried, or (ii) 
married, but not living with his/her spouse, the applicant will be 
deemed to be a head of a family if the primary source of economic 
contribution to the support of the family is attributable to the 
applicant. Welfare or support payment made to the applicant by the 
government or his/her spouse shall be deemed attributable to the 
applicant.
    (4) The Bureau shall not presume that a husband is a head of a 
family for purposes of this part solely because of his status as a 
husband. The Bureau shall not presume that a wife is not a head of a 
family for purposes of this part solely because of her status as a wife.
    (5) The Bureau shall not presume that a Sioux woman married to a 
non-Sioux man is a head of a family for purposes of this part solely 
because of such status. The Bureau shall not presume that a Sioux woman 
marrried to a Sioux man is not a head of a family for purposes of this 
part solely because of such status.
    (d) Double benefits. The prohibition against multiple payment of 
Sioux benefits to a person in his/her own right extends to the payment 
of Sioux benefits under any Federal statute. However, a person will not 
be deemed to have received payment of Sioux benefits in his/her own 
right due to the fact that:
    (1) Sioux benefits were paid to such person in his/her capacity as 
an heir of an Indian who, under prior law, was held to have a vested 
right to receive such benefits as of the date of death, or
    (2) Sioux benefits have previously been paid to that person's spouse 
or former spouse. Although the prohibition against double benefits would 
not preclude both spouses from receiving Sioux benefits during their 
marriage (assuming they both were otherwise eligible) or preclude a 
widowed or divorced applicant from receiving Sioux benefits merely 
because his/her spouse had previously received Sioux benefits, an 
applicant would not be able to receive Sioux benefits in his/her own 
right first as a single adult and again as a head of a family, or vice 
versa.


<R05>
Sec. 125.5  Application procedure.

    (a) Agency Superintendent. Application for Sioux benefits must be 
submitted to the Agency Superintendent for the reservation and shall 
contain such information as may be prescribed by the Bureau. 
Applications must be submitted within the lifetime of the applicant. 
Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a completed application, the 
Agency Superintendent shall verify the necessary information and forward 
the application and relevant documentation to the Area Director along 
with his/her recommendation for approval or disapproval.
    (b) Area Director. Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of an 
application from the Agency Superintendent, the Area Director shall 
approve or disapprove the application and notify, in writing, the 
applicant and the Agency Superintendent of such decision and, if denied, 
the reasons therefor. Failure of the Area Director to act within the

[[Page 356]]

specified time shall have the effect of approval of the application.
    (c) Appeal. Approval of an application by the Area Director shall be 
final and conclusive. Disapproval of an application may be appealed to 
the Commissioner pursuant to the administrative review procedures of 25 
CFR part 2, and the Commissioner's determination shall be subject to the 
administrative appeal procedures of 43 CFR part 4, subpart D. Approval 
of an application on administrative appeal or pursuant to judicial 
review shall relate back to the date of the Area Director's decision.
    (d) Prior applications. (1) Eligibility for Sioux Benefits will be 
determined by an applicant's status as of the date of application, 
except that where an applicant's application was disapproved prior to 
the promulgation of these regulations under the provisions of previous 
Bureau regulations or policies, the applicant may reapply and, if he/she 
so requests, have his/her eligibility determined based upon his/her 
status as of the date of such prior application, which shall be deemed 
to be the date of the application, but nothing in this subsection shall 
be construed to allow any application to be made on behalf of a deceased 
Sioux Indian whose prior application was disapproved.
    (2) Unallotted Sioux Indians of the Pine Ridge and Rosebud 
Reservations whose applications were submitted and disapproved prior to 
the termination of payment of Sioux benefits on each respective 
reservation may reapply for benefits under this subsection within one 
year of the effective date of this part and receive payment if their 
eligibility under Sec. 125.4(b) is established as of the date of such 
initial application.
    (e) Information collection. The information collection requirements 
contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1076-0004. 
The information is being collected to provide information necessary for 
the Bureau to determine eligibility for Sioux benefits. This information 
will be used to grant statutory benefits. The obligation to respond is 
required to obtain a benefit.

<R05>
Sec. 125.6  Administration.

as provided by Federal law.
    (b) Payment of Sioux benefits shall be made in accordance with a 
budget or plan for expenditure submitted by the applicant and approved 
by the Agency Superintendent.
    (c) The Commissioner shall annually compute the commuted monetary 
value of Sioux benefits to be effective on October 1 of that year and 
notify the affected tribes and Bureau agencies of such determination.
    (d) The Area Director shall annually notify both the Cheyenne River 
Sioux Tribe and the Commissioner of the number of Sioux benefits 
remaining available to be paid under the provisions of the Act of June 
18, 1934, c. 576, Sec. 14, 48 Stat. 987, 25 U.S.C. 474.

information is being collected to solicit information necessary to make 
a determination of eligibility for Sioux benefits. The information will 
be used to determine eligibility for payment. Response is required to 
obtain a benefit.

<R05>
Sec. 134.1  Partial reimbursement of irrigation charges; 5 percent per annum of cost of system, June 30, 1920.

    In pursuance of the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 
U.S.C. 386), regulations governing partial payment of construction 
charges on Indian irrigation projects, with the exception of certain 
ones mentioned therein, where approved by the Department June 21, 1920, 
and require that each owner of irrigable land under any irrigation 
system constructed for the benefit of Indians under provisions of law 
requiring reimbursement of the cost of such system and to which land, 
water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from such system, shall 
pay, on or before November 15, 1920, a sum equal to 5 percent of the per 
acre cost, as of June 30, 1920, of the construction of the system under 
which such land is situated. The per acre cost of a given system as of 
June 30, 1920, shall be determined by dividing the total amount expended 
for construction purposes on such system up to that day by the total 
area of land to which water for irrigation purposes can be delivered on 
that date; and on November 15 of each year following the year 1920, 
until further notice, the land owners, as therein prescribed, shall pay 
5 percent of the per acre construction cost as of June 30, of the 
current year, such per acre cost to be determined by dividing the cost 
of the system to June 30 of that year by the total area of land to which 
water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from the system on that 
date. Provision is contained that no payments shall be required under 
the regulations in behalf of lands still in process of allotment or 
prior to the issuance of the first or trust patent therefor, nor for 
lands reserved for school, agency, or other administrative purposes 
where the legal title still remains in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 134.2  Landowners financially unable to pay.

    Considerable difficulty has been encountered in collecting charges 
under the regulations in this part owing to the fact that Indians have 
been financially unable to pay the charges, the result being that the 
construction charges have accrued against the lands and in cases where 
the land is sold for the benefit of the allottee or his heirs under the 
regulations, the purchaser is to pay the accrued and future irrigation 
charges which make it difficult in some instances, to sell the land at 
as favorable terms as might otherwise be secured.


<R05>
Sec. 134.3  Period for payments extended.

    Furthermore, in recent legislation dealing with specific projects in 
the Bureau and also all reclamation projects the policy has been to 
extend the payment of such charges over a longer period of years.


<R05>
Sec. 134.4  Annual payment reduced.

    In view of these conditions the regulations governing this matter 
are hereby modified so as to distribute the unaccrued installments over 
a period of time so that 2\1/2\ percent of the total amount yet due 
shall be due and payable on November 15 of each year until further 
notice. You shall accordingly ascertain the per acre cost after 
deducting the amount of the accrued charges and take 2\1/2\ percent of 
that amount and a like sum each year so that the amount of the annual 
installments will be the same each year. Superintendents are obligated 
to submit all proposed lists of sales involving allotments containing 
irrigable allotments to the project or supervising engineer for 
checking, as to the irrigable acreage and amounts of unpaid 
construction, operation, and maintenance charges against such 
allotments. Each sale forwarded to the Bureau for action shall be 
accompanied by contract executed on Form 5-462b where irrigable acreage 
is involved and after approval thereof a copy of contract on said form 
shall be sent to the project engineer for his records and the charges 
paid by the purchaser shall be turned over to the disbursing agent for 
credit and deposit as instructed in the next paragraph.

[[Page 358]]

The regulations in this part shall not apply to lands in the Wapato 
project, on the Yakima Indian Reservation, nor to the irrigation 
projects on the Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, and Crow Reservations, 
Montana, for which special regulations have been issued nor to the Fort 
Hall Reservation, Idaho, or the San Carlos project, Arizona.\1\


    \1\ The special regulations for Wapato, Fort Peck, and Flathead, 
were not codified. Operations of the Blackfeet project were discontinued 
by the Bureau, July 20, 1938, effective September 30, 1933.

Sec. 134.4a  Assessment and collection of additional construction costs.

    (a) Upon the completion of the construction of an Indian irrigation 
project, or unit thereof, subsequent to the determination of the partial 
per acre construction assessment rate which was fixed prior to July 1, 
1957, pursuant to Sec. 134.4 the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative shall determine such additional construction 
cost and distribute that cost on a per acre basis against all of the 
irrigable lands of the project, or unit thereof, and \1/40\th of such 
per acre additional construction cost thus determined shall be assessed 
and collected annually from the non-Indian landowner of the project, or 
unit, thereof. The first installment shall be due and payable on 
November 15 of the year following the completion of such additional 
construction work or, if such additional construction work on the 
project, or unit thereof, has been completed prior to July 1, 1957, and 
the per acre annual rate determined, the first installment of the 
additional construction cost to be repaid by such non-Indian landowners 
shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958. This annual per acre rate 
shall be in addition to, and run concurrently with, the per acre 
construction rate assessed annually under Sec. 134.4.
    (b) Project lands in Indian ownership are not subject to assessment 
for their proportionate share of the per acre construction cost of the 
project, or unit thereof, until after the Indian title to the land has 
been extinguished. At that time the total annual per acre assessment 
rate against non-Indian lands of the project, or unit thereof, shall be 
assessed against the former Indian lands for each and every acre of 
irrigable land to which water can be delivered through the project 
works, beginning on November 15 of the year following the extinguishment 
of the Indian title to the land and on November 15 of each year 
thereafter over a forty year period. In cases where the Indian title to 
project land was extinguished prior to July 1, 1957, the assessment rate 
shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958.


<R05>
Sec. 134.5  Payments to disbursing officer.

    Payments under this part shall be made to the disbursing officer for 
the supervising engineer of the Indian Irrigation Service having 
jurisdiction over the irrigation system under which the land for which 
payment is made may lie. The sum so collected will then, after proper 
credit has been made to the land for which collected, be deposited in 
the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the respective funds 
used in constructing irrigation systems toward which reimbursement shall 
have been made.


<R05>
Sec. 134.6  ``Owner'' defined.

    The word ``owner'' as used in this part shall be construed to 
include any person, Indian or white, or any firm, partnership, 
corporation, association, or other organization to whom title to the 
land capable of irrigation, as provided in the act of February 14, 1920 
(41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386), has passed, either by fee or trust 
patent, or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 134.7  Modifications.

    The act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 386a), cancelled 
all irrigation assessments for construction costs against lands in 
Indian ownership which were unpaid at that date and deferred all future 
assessments for construction costs until the Indian title to the land 
shall have been extinguished.

    Under provisions of the act of Congress approved June 28, 1946 (60 
Stat. 333-338), contracts were executed June 28, 1951, by the United 
States with the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District 
and the Upper Little Horn Irrigation District providing for the payment, 
over a period of 40 years, by each of the Districts of its respective 
share of the sum of $210,726 expended for the construction of the Willow 
Creek storage works on account of non-Indian lands within the Districts 
entitled to share in the storage water, directly or by substitution.


<R05>
Sec. 135.2   Annual rate of assessments.

    Within the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District 
there are 3,196.8 acres for which the District is obligated by contract 
to pay its proper share of the total construction costs. Within the 
Upper Little Horn Irrigation District there are 1,554.7 acres for which 
the District is obligated by contract to pay its proper share of the 
total construction costs. There are 3,237.6 acres, more or less, covered 
by contracts with private landowners, obligating such owners to pay 
their proper share of such construction costs. The total per acre charge 
against all such lands is $26.38. This amounts to an annual per acre 
rate of $0.6595. For the purpose of this notice the annual per acre rate 
is hereby fixed at $0.66. This annual per acre rate of assessment will 
continue for a 40-year period within which the total amount of 
construction costs of $210,726 is to be repaid without interest. The 
amount of each annual installment chargeable against each of the 
Districts for the acreage covered by their respective contracts shall be 
determined by multiplying the total acreage, under each contract 
entitled to Willow Creek storage rights, either directly or by 
subsituation, by the per acre annual rate.


<R05>
Sec. 135.3  Annual assessments.

    Notice is hereby given of an annual assessment of $2,108.05 to be 
repaid by the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District for 
the 3,196.8 acres of irrigable land of the District, and an annual 
assessment of $1,025.06 to be repaid by the Upper Little Horn Irrigation 
District for the 1,554.7 acres of irrigable land of the District. 
Against the amounts due annually by the Districts under this notice, 
there shall be allowed any credits due under section 6 of the act of 
June 28, 1946. Credits due on behalf of any land shall be reflected by 
the respective Districts when placing against such land the annual 
assessment on the tax rolls.


<R05>
Sec. 135.4  Time of payment.

    Annual assessments shall be paid by the Districts to the United 
States, one-half thereof on or before February 1 and one-half thereof on 
or before July 1 following, of each year commencing with the calendar 
year 1952.


<R05>
Sec. 135.5  Penalty.

    To all assessments not paid on the due date, there shall be added a 
penalty of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof, from 
the due date so long as the delinquency continues.

acres of land, more or less, in non-Indian ownership under private 
ditches, covered by repayment contracts executed pursuant to the act of 
June 28, 1946 (60 Stat. 333-338), obligating such owners to pay their 
proper share of such construction costs. The total per acre charge 
against all such lands is $26.38. This amounts to an annual per acre 
rate of $0.6595. For the purposes of this notice the annual per acre 
rate is hereby fixed at $0.66. This annual rate of assessment will 
continue for a 40-year period within which the total amount of 
construction cost of $210,726 is to be repaid without interest. The

<R05>
Sec. 136.1  Repayment contracts.

    A rehabilitation program was established on the Fort Hall Unit of 
the Fort Hall Project in 1936. Based upon the estimated construction 
costs, contracts were signed by all non-Indian landowners within the 
project, including such landowners within the Little Indian Unit, now a 
part of the Fort Hall Unit. Under the terms of their contracts, the 
landowners agreed to repay to the Government their pro rata share, on an 
acreage basis, of all expenditures for construction and other necessary 
improvements for carrying out the approved program, payments not to 
exceed $7.50 per acre, based upon an estimated expenditure of 
$450,000.00 for a project then considered as covering approximately 
60,000 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 136.2  Construction costs.

    The program of rehabilitation has now been completed at a cost of 
$419,186.52. This amount, chargeable on an equal per acre basis against 
60,000 acres, amounts to a rate of $6.986 per acre, which rate is hereby 
determined to be the per acre cost to be repaid to the United States 
under the 1936 contracts.

[[Page 361]]


<R05>
Sec. 136.3  Repayment of construction costs.

    Under the terms of the contracts, the landowners agreed to repay the 
construction cost in forty (40) equal annual installments. Therefore, 
the annual per acre installment is hereby fixed at seventeen and one-
half cents (17\1/2\ cents) per acre, due and payable on December 1st of 
each year, the first payment being due on December 1, 1955. Under 
section 4 of the repayment contracts of the landowners and the act of 
March 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 210), the charges remain a lien against the 
lands until paid.

<R05>
Sec. 137.1  Water supply.

    The engineering report dealt with in section 1 of the act of June 7, 
1924 (43 Stat. 475) and other available records show that the storage 
capacity of the San Carlos reservoir created by the Coolidge Dam and the 
water supply therefor over a period of years will provide for the 
irrigation of only 80,000 acres of lands in Indian and public or private 
ownership within the San Carlos irrigation project, the balance of the 
water supply needed for the additional 20,000 acres of the project to be 
provided for by recaptured and return flow water and by means of pumping 
the underground supply. The cost of providing the proposed supply and of 
operating the works for this latter acreage to be equally distributed 
over the entire 100,000 acres of the project regardless of where the 
works are placed and operated.


<R05>
Sec. 137.2  Availability of water.

    Pursuant to section 3 of the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 475), 
requiring the Secretary of the Interior by public notice to announce 
when water is actually available for lands in private ownership under 
the project and the amount of the construction charges per irrigable 
acre against the same which charges shall be payable in annual 
installments as provided for therein, this public notice, of which 
Sec. 137.1 is made a part hereof, is hereby given:
    The date when a reasonable water supply is actually available for 
lands in private ownership under the San Carlos irrigation project is 
hereby declared to be the 1st day of December 1932.


<R05>
Sec. 137.3  Construction charges.

    Each acre of land in private ownership of said project is hereby 
charged with $95.25 of construction cost assessable thereto at the date 
hereof (Dec. 1, 1932), which sum is based upon 50,000 acres of such 
privately owned lands, making a total charge or assessment due from the 
owners thereof of $4,762,250 on this date (Dec. 1, 1932), excluding the 
cost of operation and maintenance for the calendar year of 1933 which 
may be carried into construction cost as provided for by section 3 of 
the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), and also excluding interest at 
the rate of 4 percent which is charged against such lands by said act. 
Of the 50,000 acres constituting the lands in private ownership within 
the said project only 46,107.49 acres have at this date (Dec. 1, 1932) 
actually been designated as coming within the project. Should this 
present designated area be not increased within a reasonable time 
herefrom and prior to the due date of the first installment of the 
charge fixed in this section, namely, on December 1, 1935, so as to 
bring the total designated area up to the 50,000 acres, the per acre 
charge fixed in this section shall be proportionately increased against 
the then designated area so as to assure reimbursement of the total 
indebtedness due the Government by the owners of the lands in private 
ownership from the lesser designated acreage.

[[Page 362]]


<R05>
Sec. 137.4  Future charges.

    The payment of said construction cost and costs of future operation 
and maintenance of said project as provided for in said section 3 of the 
act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), as supplemented or amended and such 
contingent project liabilities which may be incurred in accordance with 
the provisions of said repayment contract shall be made in accordance 
with the provisions of said act of June 7, 1924, as supplemented or 
amended and the repayment contract by and between the San Carlos 
irrigation and drainage district and the Secretary of the Interior 
bearing date of June 8, 1931; the said construction cost incurred 
subsequent to this public notice assessable against the lands in private 
ownership and costs of operation and maintenance assessed against such 
privately owned lands within the project for the first year after this 
public notice to be included in the construction cost and such 
contingent project liabilities which may be incurred in accordance with 
provisions of the repayment contract shall also be repaid to the 
Government pursuant to the terms of said act of June 7, 1924, as 
supplemented or amended, and the repayment contract and this public 
notice.


<R05>
Sec. 137.5  Construction costs limited.

    The repayment contract \1\ with the San Carlos irrigation and 
drainage district, page 13 thereof, contains the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Contract available at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, 
D.C.

    In accordance with the foregoing the costs of the San Carlos project 
as fixed by the public notice to be issued as aforesaid, unless further 
sums shall be agreed to by the Secretary of the Interior and the 
district after the execution of this instrument, may amount to but shall 
not exceed the sum of $9,556,313.77, except that said total may be 
exceeded by the inclusion of any sums expended to safeguard the project 
as hereinabove provided for, and any sums expended on account of 
contingent liabilities as in the next paragraph hereof provided.
    The foregoing and subsequent statements of project costs, the 
district's shares of which are to be repaid hereunder, unless otherwise 
provided by Congress more favorably to the lands of the project, may be 
increased by the addition of sums not now fixed as project charges but 
which possibly constitute contingent project liabilities incurred after 
the date of the San Carlos Act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), or 
incurred on account of the Florence-casa Grande project, and so may 
become project charges by the judgment of courts of competent 
jurisdiction or of other proper authority.
    The limitations therein fixed has approximately been reached, there 
remaining but $32,815.02 yet to be expended on project works before 
reaching that limitation. Upon the expenditure of this additional sum 
there shall be no further expenditures of funds for construction, 
operation and maintenance of the San Carlos project so far as the 
private lands are concerned until the San Carlos irrigation and drainage 
district shall, through appropriate action, authorize pursuant to the 
terms of the said repayment contract such additional expenditures. This 
limitation does not apply to project expenditures for the extension of 
the distributing and pumping system regardless of where they may arise. 
This class of expenditures being excepted from the limitation on 
expenditures contained in the said repayment contract by section 14, 
page 10, thereof, which section is known as the ``Equalization of 
Expenditures.''


<R05>
Sec. 137.6  Power development.

    The cost of the power development at the Coolidge Dam is hereby 
fixed at $735,000. The net revenues derived from the operation of this 
power development shall be disposed of as required by the terms and 
conditions of the act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210) as supplemented or 
amended.


<R05>
Sec. 137.7  Private ownership defined.

    The term ``private ownership'' used in this public notice includes 
all lands of the San Carlos irrigation project that have or may be 
designated by the Secretary of the Interior that are situated outside of 
the boundaries of the Gila River Indian Reservation.


<R05>
Sec. 137.8  Indian lands excluded.

    This public notice, with the exception of that part dealing with 
payment in advance each year of operation and maintenance charges 
against lands in Indian ownership operated under lease, does not apply 
in so far as payments are concerned to Indian lands within the project. 
The act of July 1, 1932 (47

Sec. 139.1  Construction costs and assessable acreage.

    The construction program has been completed on the Wapato-Satus Unit 
of the Wapato Indian Irrigation Project, and the construction costs have 
been established by Designation Report dated August 1962 as 
$7,903,823.12 for the project and $1,499,073.62 for the ``B'' lands 
share of the construction costs in the Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs 
on the Yakima River. The area benefited by this development has been 
established at 136,559.59 acres divided into 79,025.68 acres of ``A'' 
land and 57,533.91 acres of ``B'' land. Under the requirements of the 
acts of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409), and March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 
210), these costs are to be repaid to the U.S. Treasury by the owners of

lands in non-Indian ownership as established by Designation Report dated 
August 1962. Under the provisions of the acts cited in Sec. 139.1 the 
annual per acre assessment for forty equal annual payments, is hereby 
fixed at $1.45 per acre for ``A'' lands and $2.10 per acre for ``B'' 
lands for the year 1962 and each succeeding year, until the entire cost 
for each tract shall have been repaid to the U.S. Treasury. On those 
tracts where payments have been made pursuant to uncodified special 
regulations, annual assessments beginning with the year 1962 at the rate 
of $1.45 per acre for ``A'' lands and $2.10 per acre for ``B'' lands 
will be made until the entire cost of $57.8782 per acre for ``A'' lands 
and $83.9337 per acre for ``B'' lands shall have been repaid to the U.S.

    In conformity with the act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; U.S.C.

    Indian-owned lands passing to non-Indian ownership shall be assessed 
for construction costs and the first assessment shall be due on December

costs against this land will be established as provided by section 5 of 
the act of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 680). The annual per acre 
assessment rate will be determined by dividing the established 
construction cost per acre into forty equal payments. ``B'' lands will 
also be assessed for reservoir construction costs in the annual per-acre 
rate as established in the Designation Report dated August 1962. 
Assessments against this land will continue until the entire established 
construction costs shall have been repaid to the U.S. Treasury. 
Landowners may pay at any time the total of the then remaining 
indebtedness. Under the act of March 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 210), the unpaid 
charges stand as a lien against the lands until paid.

restricting access to such records, or there are strong policy grounds 
for denying access where such access is not required by the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. It shall be the policy of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs that, unless specifically authorized, monetary 
considerations will not be disclosed insofar as leases of tribal land 
are concerned.
    (b) Before disclosing information concerning any living individual, 
the Manager, Land Titles and Records Office, shall consult 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b) and the notice of routine users then in effect to determine 
whether the information may be released without the written consent of 
the person to whom it pertains.

authorizing a particular trust acquisition, Indian reservation means

outstanding when an order removing restrictions becomes effective shall 
be

lands of the Five Civilized Tribes, or any interest therein, may not be

Indian to execute an instrument purporting to convey any trust land or 
interest therein, or the offering of any such instrument for record, is

Indian tribe, lands owned by a tribe with Federal restrictions against 
alienation and any other land owned by an Indian tribe may only be

    Applications for the sale, exchange or gift of trust or restricted 
land shall be filed in the form approved by the Secretary with the

case, the transaction appears to be clearly justified in the light of 
the long-range best interest of the owner or owners or as under 
conditions set out in Sec. 152.25(d).


<R05>
Sec. 152.24  Appraisal.

    Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, an appraisal shall be 
made indicating the fair market value prior to making or approving a 
sale, exchange, or other transfer of title of trust or restricted land.


<R05>
Sec. 152.25  Negotiated sales, gifts and exchanges of trust or restricted lands.

    Those sales, exchanges, and gifts of trust or restricted lands

(d) of this section may be negotiated; all other sales shall be by 
advertised sale, except as may be otherwise provided by the Secretary.
    (a) Consideration not less than the appraised fair market value. 
Indian owners may, with the approval of the Secretary, negotiate a sale 
of and sell trust or restricted land for not less than the appraised 
fair market value:
    (1) When the sale is to the United States, States, or political 
subdivisions thereof, or such other sale as may be for a public purpose;
    (2) When the sale is to the tribe or another Indian; or
    (3) When the Secretary determines it is impractical to advertise.
    (b) Exchange at appraised fair market value. With the approval of 
the Secretary, Indian owners may exchange trust or restricted land, or a 
combination of such land and other things of value, for other lands or 
combinations of land and other things of value. The value of the 
consideration received by the Indian in the exchange must be at least 
substantially equal to the appraised fair market value of the 
consideration given by him.
    (c) Sale to coowners. With the approval of the Secretary, Indian 
owners may negotiate a sale of and sell trust or restricted land to a 
coowner of that land. The consideration may be less than the appraised 
fair market value, if in the opinion of the Secretary there is a special 
relationship between the coowners or special circumstances exist.
    (d) Gifts and conveyances for less than the appraised fair market 
value. With the approval of the Secretary, Indian owners may convey 
trust or restricted land, for less than the appraised fair market value 
or for no consideration when the prospective grantee is the owner's 
spouse, brother, sister, lineal ancestor of Indian blood or lineal 
descendant, or when some other special relationship exists between the 
grantor and grantee or special circumstances exist that in the opinion 
of the Secretary warrant the approval of the conveyance.


<R05>
Sec. 152.26  Advertisement.

    (a) Upon approval of an application for an advertised sale, notice 
of the sale will be published not less than 30 days prior to the date 
fixed for the sale unless for good cause a shorter period is authorized 
by the Secretary.
    (b) The notice of sale will include:

[[Page 401]]

record with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and any other information that 
may improve sale prospects.


<R05>
Sec. 152.27  Procedure of sale.

    Advertised sales shall be by sealed bids except as otherwise 
provided herein.
    (a)(1) Bids, conforming to the requirements set out in the 
advertisement of sale, along with a certified check, cashier's check, 
money order, or U.S. Treasury check, payable to the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, for not less than 10 percent of the amount of the bid, must be 
enclosed in a sealed envelope marked as prescribed in the notice of 
sale. A cash deposit may be submitted in lieu of the above-specified 
negotiable instruments at the bidder's risk. Tribes submitting bids 
pursuant to this paragraph may guarantee the required 10 percent deposit 
by an appropriate resolution;
    (2) The sealed envelopes containing the bids will be publicly opened 
at the time fixed for sale. The bids will be announced and will be 
appropriately recorded.
    (b) The policy of the Secretary recognizes that in many instances a 
tribe or a member thereof has a valid interest in acquiring trust or 
restricted lands offered for sale.
    (1) With the consent of the owner and when the notice of sale so 
states, the tribe or members of such tribe shall have the right to meet 
the high bid.
    (2) Provided the tribe is not the high bidder and when one or more 
acceptable sealed bids are received and when so stated in the notice of 
sale, an oral auction may be held following the bid opening. Bidding in 
the auction will be limited to the tribe, and to those who submitted 
sealed bids at 75 percent or more of the appraised value of the land 
being auctioned. At the conclusion of the auction the highest bidder 
must increase his deposit to not less than 10 percent of his auction 
bid.


<R05>
Sec. 152.28  Action at close of bidding.

    (a) The officer in charge of the sale shall publicly announce the 
apparent highest acceptable bid. The deposits submitted by the 
unsuccessful bidders shall be returned immediately. The deposit 
submitted by the apparent successful bidder shall be held in a special 
account.
    (b) If the highest bid received at an advertised sale is less than 
the appraised fair market value of the land, the Secretary with the 
consent of the owner may accept that bid if the amount bid approximates 
said appraised fair market value and in the Secretary's judgment is the 
highest price that may be realized in the circumstances.
    (c) The Secretary shall award the bid and notify the apparent 
successful bidder that the remainder of the purchase price must be 
submitted within 30 days.
    (1) Upon a showing of cause the Secretary may, in his discretion, 
extend the time of payment of the balance due.
    (2) If the remainder of the purchase price is not paid within the 
time allowed, the bid will be rejected and the apparent successful 
bidder's 10 percent deposit will be forfeited to the landowner's use.
    (d) The issuance of the patent or delivery of a deed to the 
purchaser will not be authorized until the balance of the purchase price 
has been paid, except that the fee patent may be ordered in cases where 
the purchaser is obtaining a loan from an agency of the Federal 
Government and such agency has given the Secretary a commitment that the 
balance of the purchase price will be paid when the fee patent is 
issued.


<R05>
Sec. 152.29  Rejection of bids; disapproval of sale.

    The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all bids before 
the award, after the award, or at any time prior to the issuance of a 
patent or delivery of a deed, when he shall have determined such 
rejection to be in the best interests of the Indian owner.


<R05>
Sec. 152.30  Bidding by employees.

    Except as authorized by the provisions of part 140 of this chapter, 
no person employed in Indian Affairs shall directly or indirectly bid, 
make, or prepare any bid, or assist any bidder in preparing his bid. 
Sales between Indians, either of whom is an employee of the U.S. 
Government, are governed by

[[Page 402]]

the provisions of part 140 of this chapter (see 25 U.S.C. 68 and 441).


<R05>
Sec. 152.31  Cost of conveyance; payment.

    Pursuant to the Act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 415), as amended 
by the Act of March 1, 1933 (47 Stat. 1417; 25 U.S.C. 413), the 
Secretary may in his discretion collect from a purchaser reasonable fees 
for work performed or expense incurred in the transaction. The amount so 
collected shall be deposited to the credit of the United States as 
general fund receipts, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (a)(1) The amount of the fee shall be $22.50 for each transaction.
    (2) The fee may be reduced to a lesser amount or may be waived, if 
the Secretary determines circumstances justify such action.
    (b)(1) If any or all of the costs of the work performed or expenses 
incurred are paid with tribal funds, an alternate schedule of fees may 
be established, subject to approval of the Secretary, and that part of 
such fees deemed appropriate may be credited to the tribe.
    (2) When the purchaser is the tribe which bears all or any part of 
such costs, the collection of the proportionate share from the tribe may 
be waived.


<R05>
Sec. 152.32  Irrigation fee; payment.

    Collection of all construction costs against any Indian-owned lands 
within Indian irrigation projects is deferred as long as Indian title 
has not been extinguished. (Act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 
386a)). This statute is interpreted to apply only where such land is 
owned by Indians either in trust or restricted status.
    (a) When any person whether Indian or non-Indian acquires Indian 
lands in a fee simple status that are part of an Indian irrigation 
project he must enter into an agreement,
    (1) To pay the pro rata share of the construction of the project 
chargeable to the land,
    (2) To pay all construction costs that accrue in the future, and
    (3) To pay all future charges assessable to the land which are based 
on the annual cost of operation and maintenance of the irrigation 
system.
    (b) Any operation and maintenance charges that are delinquent when 
Indian land is sold will be deducted from the proceeds of sale unless 
other acceptable arrangements are made to provide for their payment 
prior to the approval of the sale.
    (c) A lien clause covering all unpaid irrigation construction costs, 
past and future, will be inserted in the patent or other instrument of 
conveyance issued to all purchasers of restricted or trust lands that 
are under an Indian irrigation project.

    Cross-Reference: See part 159 and part 160 and cross-references 
thereunder in this chapter for further regulations regarding sale of 
irrigable lands.

               Partitions In Kind Of Inherited Allotments


<R05>
Sec. 152.33  Partition.

    (a) Partition without application. If the Secretary of the Interior 
shall find that any inherited trust allotment or allotments (as 
distinguished from lands held in a restricted fee status or authorized 
to be sold under the Act of May 14, 1948 (62 Stat. 236; 25 U.S.C. 483)), 
are capable of partition in kind to the advantage of the heirs, he may 
cause such lands to be partitioned among them, regardless of their 
competency, patents in fee to be issued to the competent heirs for their 
shares and trust patents to be issued to the incompetent heirs for the 
lands respectively or jointly set apart to them, the trust period to 
terminate in accordance with the terms of the original patent or order 
of extension of the trust period set out in said patent. (Act of May 18, 
1916 (39 Stat. 127; 25 U.S.C. 378)). The authority contained in the Act 
of May 18, 1916, is not applicable to lands authorized to be sold by the 
Act of May 14, 1948, nor to land held in restricted fee status.
    (b) Application for partition. Heirs of a deceased allottee may make 
written application, in the form approved by the Secretary, for 
partition of their trust or restricted land. If the Secretary finds the 
trust lands susceptible of partition, he may issue new patents or deeds 
to the heirs for the portions set aside to them. If the allotment is

[[Page 403]]

held under a restricted fee title (as distinguished from a trust title), 
partition may be accomplished by the heirs executing deeds approved by 
the Secretary, to the other heirs for their respective portions.

         Mortgages and Deeds of Trust to Secure Loans to Indians


<R05>
Sec. 152.34  Approval of mortgages and deeds of trust.

    Any individual Indian owner of trust or restricted lands, may with 
the approval of the Secretary execute a mortgage or deed of trust to his 
land. Prior to approval of such mortgage or deed of trust, the Secretary 
shall secure appraisal information as he deems advisable. Such lands 
shall be subject to foreclosure or sale pursuant to the terms of the 
mortgage or deed of trust in accordance with the laws of the State in 
which the lands are located. For the purpose of foreclosure or sale 
proceedings under this section, the Indian owners shall be regarded as 
vested with unrestricted fee simple title to the lands (Act of March 29, 
1956).

(70 Stat. 62; 25 U.S.C. 483a)


<R05>
Sec. 152.35  Deferred payment sales.

    When the Indian owner and purchaser desire, a sale may be made or 
approved on the deferred payment plan. The terms of the sale will be 
incorporated in a memorandum of sale which shall constitute a contract 
for delivery of title upon payment in full of the amount of the agreed 
consideration. The deed executed by the grantor or grantors will be held 
by the Superintendent and will be delivered only upon full compliance 
with the terms of sale. If conveyance of title is to be made by fee 
patent, request therefor will be made only upon full compliance with the 
terms of the sale. The terms of the sale shall require that the 
purchaser pay not less than 10 percent of the purchase price in advance 
as required by the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 855), as amended (25 
U.S.C. 372); terms for the payment of the remaining installments plus 
interest shall be those acceptable to the Secretary and the Indian 
owner. If the purchaser on any deferred payment plan makes default in 
the first or subsequent payments, all payments, including interest, 
previously made will be forfeited to the Indian owner.

agency having jurisdiction over the affairs of the tribe of which such 
parent is an alleged member or descendant of a member thereof, is unable

years or over, is of less than one-half Indian blood, he shall notify 
such person of his finding and inform him that if objection is not 
received within 20 days from the date of notification, a certificate of 
competency will be issued. If the person claims to be of one-half or 
more Indian blood and that a certificate of competency should not be 
issued, he should submit to the superintendent two affidavits or other 
evidence in support of his claim. The claim, affidavits or other 
evidence of the person as to his quantum of blood shall be submitted to 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for a ruling before the certificate 
of competency is issued.

Indian blood. Such certificate shall be recorded with the county clerk 
of Osage County, Oklahoma, before delivering the same to the person 
entitled thereto.

Sec. 154.6  Costs of recording certificates of competency.

    The superintendent may expend the surplus funds of a person to make 
direct payments of the cost of recording a certificate of competency. If 
the person to whom a certificate of competency is issued has no surplus 
funds, the cost of recording the same shall be paid from Osage tribal 
funds.


<R05>
Sec. 154.7  Delivery of cash and securities.

    After issuance and recordation of a certificate of competency as 
authorized by the regulations in this part, the superintendent shall 
deliver to the individual named therein, or the legal guardian thereof, 
the original copy of the certificate of competency, together with all 
cash, stocks and bonds credited to the account of such individual upon 
the books of the Osage Agency, and obtain a receipt therefor.

<R05>
Sec. 158.51  Definitions.

    When used in this part:
    (a) ``Homestead'' means the restricted nontaxable lands, not 
exceeding 160 acres, allotted to an enrolled member of the Osage Tribe 
pursuant to the act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539), or the restricted 
surplus lands designated in lieu thereof pursuant to the act of May 25, 
1918 (40 Stat. 578).
    (b) ``Surplus land'' means those restricted lands, other than the 
homestead, allotted to an enrolled member of the Osage Tribe pursuant to 
the act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539).


<R05>
Sec. 158.52  Application for change in designation of homestead.

    Any Osage allottee or the legal guardian thereof may make 
application to change his homestead for an equal area of his surplus 
land. The application shall give in detail the reasons why such change 
is desired and shall be submitted to the Osage Indian Agency on the form 
``Application to Change Designation of Homestead.''


<R05>
Sec. 158.53  Order to change designation of homestead.

    The application of an Osage allottee, or his legal guardian, may be 
approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or his authorized 
representative, and an order issued to change designation of homestead, 
if it is found that the applicant owns an equal area of surplus land. 
The expense of recording the order shall be borne by the applicant. The 
order to change designation shall be made on the form ``Order to Change 
Designation of Homestead.''


<R05>
Sec. 158.54  Exchanges of restrictive lands.

    Upon written application of the Indians involved, the exchange of 
restricted lands between adult Indians,

[[Page 407]]

and between adult Indians and non-Indians, may be approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior, or his authorized representative. Title to 
all lands acquired under this part by an Indian who does not have a 
certificate of competency shall be taken by deed containing a clause 
restricting alienation or encumbrance without the consent of the 
Secretary, or his authorized representative. In case of differences in 
the appraised value of lands under consideration for exchange, the 
application of an Indian for funds to equalize such differences may be 
approved to the extent authorized by Sec. 117.8 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 158.55  Institution of partition proceedings.

    (a) Prior authorization should be obtained from the Secretary, or 
his authorized representative, before the institution of proceedings to 
partition the lands of deceased Osage allottees in which any interest is 
held by an Osage Indian not having a certificate of competency. Requests 
for authority to institute such partition proceedings shall contain a 
description of the lands involved, the names of the several owners and 
their respective interests and the reasons for such court action. 
Authorization may be given for the institution of partition proceedings 
in a court of competent jurisdiction when it appears to the best 
interest of the Indians involved to do so and the execution of voluntary 
exchange deeds is impracticable.
    (b) When it appears to the best interest of the Indians to do so, 
the Secretary's, or his authorized representative's, authorization to 
institute partition proceedings may require that title to the lands be 
quieted in the partition action in order that the deeds issued pursuant 
to the proceedings shall convey good and merchantable title to the 
grantee therein. (See section 6, 37 Stat. 87.)


<R05>
Sec. 158.56  Partition records.

    Upon completion of an action in partition, a copy of the judgment 
roll showing schedule of costs and owelty moneys having accrued to or 
from the several parties, together with deeds, or other instruments 
vesting title on partition, in triplicate, shall be furnished to the 
Osage Agency. The original allotment number shall follow the legal 
description on all instruments vesting title. When a grantee is a member 
of the Osage Tribe who has not received a certificate of competency, 
deeds or other instruments vesting title shall contain the following 
clause against alienation:

    Subject to the condition that while title to the above-described 
lands shall remain in the grantee or his Osage Indian heirs or devisees 
who do not have certificates of competency, the same shall not be 
alienated or encumbered without approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior or his authorized representative.


<R05>
Sec. 158.57  Approval of deeds or other instruments vesting title on partition and payment of costs.

    Upon completion of the partition proceedings in accordance with the 
law and in conformity with the regulations in this part, the Secretary, 
or his authorized representative, may approve the deeds, or other 
instruments vesting title on partition, and may disburse from the 
restricted (accounts) funds of the Indians concerned, such amounts as 
may be necessary for payment of their share of court costs, attorney 
fees, and owelty moneys.


<R05>
Sec. 158.58  Disposition of proceeds of partition sales.

    Owelty moneys due members of the Osage Tribe who do not have 
certificates of competency shall be paid into the Treasury of the United 
States and placed to the credit of the Indians upon the same conditions 
as attach to segregated shares of the Osage national fund.

<R05>
Sec. 159.1  Conditions of contract.

    (a) The form of contract (Form 5-462b) \1\ for sale of irrigable 
lands specifically provides that the purchaser will obligate and pay on 
a per acre basis all irrigation charges assessed or to be assessed 
against the land purchased including accrued assessment, which accrued 
assessment shall be paid prior to the approval of the sale, and for the 
payment of the construction and operation and maintenance assessments on 
the due dates of each year. The agreement is to be acknowledged and 
recorded in the county records in which county the land is situated. The 
charges incidental to the recording of the instrument shall be paid by 
the purchaser at the time of executing the agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Forms may be obtained from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
Washington, D.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) A strict compliance with the terms of paragraph (a) of this 
section is absolutely necessary and required.

[22 FR 10566, Dec. 24, 1957. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]

    Note: On May 12, 1921, Circular No. 1677, re sale of irrigable 
lands, was addressed to all superintendents. It was pointed out therein 
that the collection of irrigation construction charges was required by 
the terms of an act approved February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 
386), and that in addition to the construction charge there was an 
operation and maintenance charge assessable annually that must be paid 
by the landowners benefited; furthermore, that the purpose of this 
circular was to point out to the superintendents the necessity of 
advising prospective purchasers that irrigation charges must be paid and 
that a so-called paid-up water right was not conveyed with the land. A 
form of agreement to be executed by the prospective purchaser 
accompanied this circular.
    It has been brought to the attention of the Bureau that irrigation 
construction charges and operation and maintenance charges have accrued 
against irrigable allotments prior to the time of their being advertised 
for sale and that the superintendents have failed to provide for payment 
of the accrued irrigation charges, with the result that no means are 
apparent for their collection.
    With a view of preventing any future misunderstanding the form of 
contract accompanying Circular No. 1677 has been redrafted and Form 5-
462b assigned to it. The circular has been designated ``No. 1677a.''

<R05>
Sec. 160.1  Liens.

    The act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210; 25 U.S.C. 387) creates a 
first lien against irrigable lands under all Indian irrigation projects 
where the construction, operation and maintenance costs of such projects 
remain unpaid and are reimbursable, and directs that such lien shall be 
recited in any patent or instrument issued for such lands to cover such 
unpaid charges. Prior to the enactment of this legislation similar liens 
had been created by legislative authority against irrigable lands of the 
projects on the Fort Yuma, Colorado River, and Gila River Reservations, 
in Arizona; Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, Fort Belknap, and Crow 
Reservations, Mont.; Wapato project, Yakima Reservation, Wash.; the 
irrigable lands on the Colville Reservation within the West Okanogan 
irrigation district, Washington, and the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho. 
This legislation, therefore, extends protection similar to that existing 
in the legislation applicable to the projects on the reservations above 
mentioned.

    Cross References: For operation and maintenance charges and 
construction costs, see parts 174, 134, and 137 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 160.2  Instructions.

    All superintendents and other officers are directed to familiarize 
themselves with this provision of law, and in all cases involving the 
issuance of patents or deeds direct to the Indian or purchaser of Indian 
allotments embracing irrigable lands, they will recite in

[[Page 409]]

the papers forwarded to the Department for action the fact that the 
lands involved are within an irrigation project (giving the name) and 
accordingly are subject to the provisions of this law. This requirement 
will be in addition to the existing regulations requiring the 
superintendents in case of sales of irrigable lands to obtain from the 
project engineer a written statement relative to the irrigability of the 
lands to be sold, and whether or not there are any unpaid irrigation 
charges, together with the estimated per acre construction cost 
assessable against the land involved in the sale. Each sale will also be 
accompanied by contract executed in accordance with regulations 
obligating the purchaser to pay the accrued charges, namely, 
construction, operation, and maintenance, prior to the approval of the 
sale and to assume and pay the unassessed irrigation charges in 
accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the 
Interior.

    Cross References: For additional regulations pertaining to the 
payment of fees and charges in connection with the sale of irrigable 
lands, see part 159 and Secs. 134.4 and 152.21 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 160.3  Leases to include description of lands.

    It is important, also, for superintendents in leasing irrigable 
lands to present to the project engineer lists containing descriptions 
of the lands involved for his approval of the irrigable acreage and for 
checking as to whether or not such lands are in fact irrigable under 
existing works. Strict compliance with this section is required for the 
purpose of avoiding error.


<R05>
Sec. 160.4  Prompt payment of irrigation charges by lessees.

    Superintendents will also see that irrigation charges are promptly 
paid by lessees, and where such charges are not so paid take appropriate 
and prompt action for their collection. Such unpaid charges are a lien 
against the land, and accordingly any failure on the part of the 
superintendents to collect same increases the obligation against the 
land.

prevent a termination of Federal trust responsibilities with respect to 
the land by the issuance of a fee patent or otherwise during the term of 
the lease; however, such termination shall not serve to abrogate the 
lease. The owners of the land and the lessee and his surety or sureties 
shall be notified of any such change in the status of the land.
    (3) The lessee agrees that he will not use or cause to be used any 
part of the leased premises for any unlawful conduct or purpose.
    (h) Leases granted or approved under this part on individually owned 
lands which provide for payment of rental direct to the owner or his 
representative shall contain the following provisions:
    (1) In the event of the death of the owner during the term of this 
lease and while the leased premises are in trust or restricted status, 
all rentals remaining due or payable to the decedent or his 
representative under the provisions of the lease shall be paid to the 
official of the Bureau of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction over the 
leased premises.
    (2) While the leased premises are in trust or restricted status, the 
Secretary may in his discretion suspend the direct rental payment 
provisions of this lease in which event the rentals

[[Page 412]]

shall be paid to the official of the Bureau of Indian Affairs having 
jurisdiction over the leased premises.


<R05>
Sec. 162.6  Negotiation of leases.

    (a) Leases of individually owned land or tribal land may be 
negotiated by those owners or their representatives who may execute 
leases pursuant to Sec. 162.3.
    (b) Where the owners of a majority interest, or their 
representatives, who may grant leases under Sec. 162.3, have negotiated 
a lease satisfactory to the Secretary he may join in the execution of 
the lease and thereby commit the interests of those persons in whose 
behalf he is authorized to grant leases under Sec. 162.2(a) (1), (2), 
(3), and (5).
    (c) Where the Secretary may grant leases under Sec. 162.2 he may 
negotiate leases when in his judgment the fair annual rental can thus be 
obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 162.7  Advertisement.

    Except as otherwise provided in this part, prior to granting a lease 
or permit as authorized under Sec. 162.2 the Secretary shall advertise 
the land for lease. Advertisements will call for sealed bids and will 
not offer preference rights.


<R05>
Sec. 162.8  Duration of leases.

    Leases granted or approved under this part shall be limited to the 
minimum duration, commensurate with the purpose of the lease, that will 
allow the highest economic return to the owner consistent with prudent 
management and conservation practices, and except as otherwise provided 
in this part shall not exceed the number of years provided for in this 
section. Except for those leases authorized by Sec. 162.5(b)(1) and (2), 
unless the consideration for the lease is based primarily on percentages 
of income produced by the land, the lease shall provide for periodic 
review, at not less than five-year intervals, of the equities involved. 
Such review shall give consideration to the economic conditions at the 
time, exclusive of improvement or development required by the contract 
or the contribution value of such improvements. Any adjustments of 
rental resulting from such review may be made by the Secretary where he 
has the authority to grant leases, otherwise the adjustment must be made 
with the written concurrence of the owners and the approval of the 
Secretary.
    (a) Leases for public, religious, educational, recreational, 
residential, or business purposes shall not exceed 25 years but may 
include provisions authorizing a renewal or an extension for one 
additional term of not to exceed 25 years, except such leases of land on 
the Hollywood (formerly Dania) Reservation, Fla.; the Navajo 
Reservation, Ariz.; N. Mex., and Utah; the Palm Springs Reservation, 
Calif.; the Southern Ute Reservation, Colo.; the Fort Mohave 
Reservation, Calif., Ariz., and Nev.; the Pyramid Lake Reservation, 
Nev.; the Gila River Reservation, Ariz.; the San Carlos Apache 
Reservation, Ariz.; the Spokane Reservation, Wash.; the Hualapai 
Reservation, Ariz.; the Swinomish Reservation, Wash.; the Pueblos of 
Cochiti, Pojoaque, Tesuque, and Zuni, N. Mex.; and land on the Colorado 
River Reservation, Ariz., and Calif., as stated in Sec. 162.18; which 
leases may be made for terms of not to exceed 99 years.
    (b) Leases may be made for 25 years for those farming purposes which 
require the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of the 
land for the production of specialized crops. To determine whether a 
long term lease is justified, it is necessary to give consideration to 
the nature of the crop to be grown, including the feasibility of growing 
the proposed crop. The amount or substantially of the investment, as 
well as the necessity of such an investment in order to grow the 
proposed crop, are also elements to consider in evaluating the term of 
the proposed lease.
    (c) Farming leases not granted for the purpose of growing 
specialized crops shall not exceed five years for dry-farming land or 
ten years for irrigable land.
    (d) Grazing leases which require substantial development or 
improvement of the land shall not exceed ten years.
    (e) Leases granted by the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 162.2(a)(3) 
shall be for a

[[Page 413]]

term of not to exceed two years except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 162.6(b).

<R05>
Sec. 162.9  Ownership of improvements.

    Improvements placed on the leased land shall become the property of 
the lessor unless specifically excepted therefrom under the terms of the 
lease. The lease shall specify the maximum time allowed for removal of 
any improvements so excepted.


<R05>
Sec. 162.10  Unitization for leasing.

    Where it appears advantageous to the owners and advantageous to the 
operation of the land a single lease contract may include more than one 
parcel of land in separate ownerships, tribal or individual, provided 
the statutory authorities and other applicable requirements of this part 
are observed.


<R05>
Sec. 162.11  Conservation and land use requirement.

    Farming and grazing operations conducted under leases granted or 
approved under this part shall be conducted in accordance with 
recognized principles of good practice and prudent management. Land use 
stipulations or conservation plans necessary to define such use shall be 
incorporated in and made a part of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 162.12  Subleases and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section, a sublease, assignment, amendment or encumbrance of any lease 
or permit issued under this part may be made only with the approval of 
the Secretary and the written consent of all parties to such lease or 
permit, including the surety or sureties.
    (b) With the consent of the Secretary, the lease may contain a 
provision authorizing the lessee to sublease the premises, in whole or 
in part, without further approval. Subleases so made shall not serve to 
relieve the sublessor from any liability nor diminish any supervisory 
authority of the Secretary provided for under the approved lease.
    (c) With the consent of the Secretary, the lease may contain 
provisions authorizing the lessee to encumber his leasehold interest in 
the premises for the purpose of borrowing capital for the development 
and improvement of the leased premises. The encumbrance instrument, must 
be approved by the Secretary. If a sale or foreclosure under the 
approved encumbrance occurs and the encumbrancer is the purchaser, he 
may assign the leasehold without the approval of the Secretary or the 
consent of the other parties to the lease, provided, however, that the 
assignee accepts and agrees in writing to be bound by all the terms and 
conditions of the lease. If the purchaser is a party other than the 
encumbrancer, approval by the Secretary of any assignment will be 
required, and such purchaser will be bound by the terms of the lease and 
will assume in writing all the obligations thereunder.
    (d) With the consent of the Secretary, leases of tribal land to 
individual members of the tribe or to tribal housing authorities may 
contain provisions permitting the assignment of the lease without 
further consent or approval where a lending institution or an agency of 
the United States makes, insures or guarantees a loan to an individual 
member of the tribe or to a tribal housing authority for the purpose of 
providing funds for the construction of housing for Indians on the 
leased premises; provided, the leasehold has been pledged as security 
for the loan and the lender has obtained the leasehold by foreclosure or 
otherwise. Such leases may with the consent of the Secretary also 
contain provisions permitting the lessee to assign the lease without 
further consent or approval.

<R05>
Sec. 162.13  Payment of fees and drainage and irrigation charges.

    (a) Except as provided in part 174 of this chapter, any lease 
covering lands within an irrigation project or drainage district shall 
require the lessee to pay annually on or before the due date, during the 
term of the lease and in the amounts determined, all charges assessed 
against such lands. Such charges

[[Page 414]]

shall be in addition to the rental payments prescribed in the lease. All 
payments of such charges and penalties shall be made to the official 
designated in the lease to receive such payments.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided in this part or by the Secretary, fees 
based upon the annual rental payable under the lease shall be collected 
on each lease, sublease, assignment, transfer, renewal, extension, 
modification, or other instrument issued in connection with the leasing 
or permitting of restricted lands under the regulations in this part.
    (1) Except where all or any part of the expenses of the work are 
paid from tribal funds, in which event an additional or alternate 
schedule of fees may be established subject to the approval of the 
Secretary, the fee to be paid shall be as follows:

    Rental Percent
On the first $500 3
On the next $4,500 2
On all rental above $5,000 1
In no event shall the fee be less than $2.00 nor exceed $250.

    (2) In the case of percentage rental leases, the fee shall be 
calculated on the basis of the guaranteed minimum rental. Where rental 
consists of a stated annual cash rental in addition to a percentage 
rental, the estimated revenue anticipated from the percentage rental 
shall be mutually agreed upon solely for the purpose of fixing the fee. 
The fee to be collected in case of crop-share or other special 
consideration leases or permits shall be based on an estimate of the 
cash rental value of the acreage, or the estimated value of the lessor's 
share of the crops. No fees so collected shall be refunded.


<R05>
Sec. 162.14  Violation of lease.

    Upon a showing satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been a 
violation of the lease or the regulations in this part, the lessee shall 
be served with written notice setting forth in detail the nature of the 
alleged violation and allowing him ten days from the date of receipt of 
notice in which to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled. The 
surety or sureties shall be sent a copy of each such notice. If within 
the ten-day period, it is determined that the breach may be corrected 
and the lessee agrees to take the necessary corrective measures, he will 
be given an opportunity to carry out such measures and shall be given a 
reasonable time within which to take corrective action to cure the 
breach. If the lessee fails within such reasonable time to correct the 
breach or to furnish satisfactory reasons why the lease should not be 
cancelled, the lessee shall forthwith be notified in writing of the 
cancellation of the lease and demands shall be made for payment of all 
obligations and for possession of the premises. The notice of 
cancellation shall inform the lessee of his right to appeal pursuant to 
part 2 of this chapter. Where breach of contract can be satisfied by the 
payment of damages, the Secretary may approve the damage settlement 
between the parties to the lease, or where the Secretary has granted the 
lease, he may accept the damage settlement. With the consent of the 
Secretary, leases of tribal land to individual members of the tribe or 
to tribal housing authorities for the purpose of providing lands on 
which housing for Indians is to be constructed, may contain a provision 
prohibiting the cancellation or termination of the lease during the 
period that a loan, loan insurance, or loan guarantee is in effect 
without the approval of the lender or the agency of the United States 
which has made, insured or guaranteed the loan for the construction of 
housing on the leased premises.

<R05>
Sec. 162.15  Crow Reservation.

    (a) Notwithstanding the regulations in other sections of this part 
162, Crow Indians classified as competent under the Act of June 4, 1920 
(41 Stat. 751), as amended, may lease their trust lands and the trust 
lands of their minor children for farming or grazing purposes without 
the approval of the Secretary pursuant to the Act of May 26, 1926 (44 
Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80). 
However, at their election Crow Indians classified as competent may 
authorize the Secretary to lease, or assist in the leasing of such 
lands, and an appropriate notice of such action shall be made a

[[Page 415]]

matter of record. When this prerogative is exercised, the general 
regulations contained in this part 162 shall be applicable. Approval of 
the Secretary is required on leases signed by Crow Indians not 
classified as competent or made on inherited or devised trust lands 
owned by more than five competent devisees or heirs.
    (b) The Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of 
March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80), provides that no lease for farming or 
grazing purposes shall be made for a period longer than five years, 
except irrigable lands under the Big Horn Canal; which may be leased for 
periods of ten years. No such lease shall provide the lessee a 
preference right to future leases which, if exercised, would thereby 
extend the total period of encumbrance beyond the five or ten years 
authorized by law.
    (c) All leases entered into by Crow Indians classified as competent, 
under the above-cited special statutes, must be recorded at the Crow 
Agency. Such recording shall constitute notice to all persons. Under 
these special statutes, Crow Indians classified as competent are free to 
lease their property within certain limitations. The five-year (ten-year 
in the case of lands under the Big Horn Canal) limitation is intended to 
afford a protection to the Indians. The essence of this protection is 
the right to deal with the property free, clear, and unencumbered at 
intervals at least as frequent as those provided by law. If lessees are 
able to obtain new leases long before the termination of existing 
leases, they are in a position to set their own terms. In these 
circumstances lessees could perpetuate their leaseholds and the 
protection of the statutory limitations as to terms would be destroyed. 
Therefore, in implementation of the foregoing interpretation, any lease 
which, on its face, is in violation of statutory limitations or 
requirements, and any grazing lease executed more than 12 months, and 
any farming lease executed more than 18 months, prior to the 
commencement of the term thereof or any lease which purports to cancel 
an existing lease with the same lessee as of a future date and take 
effect upon such cancellation will not be recorded. Under a Crow tribal 
program, approved by the Department of the Interior, competent Crow 
Indians may, under certain circumstances, enter into agreements which 
require that, for a specified term, their leases be approved. 
Information concerning whether a competent Crow Indian has executed such 
an instrument is available at the office of the Superintendent of the 
Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Crow Agency, Montana. Any lease 
entered into with a competent Crow Indian during the time such 
instrument is in effect and which is not in accordance with such 
instrument will be returned without recordation.
    (d) Where any of the following conditions are found to exist, leases 
will be recorded but the lessee and lessor will be notified upon 
discovery of the condition:
    (1) The lease in single or counterpart form has not been executed by 
all owners of the land described in the lease,
    (2) There is, of record, a lease on the land for all or a part of 
the same term,
    (3) The lease does not contain stipulations requiring sound land 
utilization plans and conservation practices, or
    (4) There are other deficiencies such as, but not limited to, 
erroneous land descriptions, and alterations which are not clearly 
endorsed by the lessor.
    (e) Any adult Crow Indian classified as competent shall have the 
full responsibility for obtaining compliance with the terms of any lease 
made by him pursuant to this section. This shall not preclude action by 
the Secretary to assure conservation and protection of these trust 
lands.
    (f) Leases made by competent Crow Indians shall be subject to the 
right to issue permits and leases to prospect for, develop, and mine 
oil, gas, and other minerals, and to grant rights-of-way and easements, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. In the issuance or 
granting of such permits, leases, rights-of-way or easements due 
consideration will be given to the interests of lessees and to the 
adjustment of any damages to such interests. In the event of a dispute 
as to the amount

[[Page 416]]

of such damage, the matter will be referred to the Secretary whose 
determination will be final as to the amount of said damage.

Sec. 162.16  Fort Belknap Reservation.

    Not to exceed 20,000 acres of allotted and tribal lands 
(nonirrigable as well as irrigable) on the Fort Belknap Reservation in 
Montana may be leased for the culture of sugar beets and other crops in 
rotation for terms not exceeding 10 years.


<R05>
Sec. 162.17  Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Reservations, California.

    (a) Upon a determination by the Secretary that the owner or owners 
are not making beneficial use thereof, restricted lands on the Cabazon, 
Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations which are or may be 
irrigated from distribution facilities administered by the Coachella 
Valley County Water District in Riverside County, California, may be 
leased by the Secretary in accordance with the regulations in this part 
for the benefit of the owner or owners.
    (b) All leases granted or approved on restricted lands of the 
Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations shall be 
filed for record in the office of the country recorder of the county in 
which the land is located, the cost thereof to be paid by the lessee. A 
copy of each such lease shall be filed by the lessee with the Coachella 
Valley County Water District or such other irrigation or water district 
within which the leased lands are located. All such leases shall include 
a provision that the lessee, in addition to the rentals provided for in 
the lease, shall pay all irrigation charges properly assessed against 
the land which became payable during the term of the lease. Act of 
August 25, 1950 (64 Stat. 470); Act of August 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 968).


<R05>
Sec. 162.18  Colorado River Reservation.

    The Act of April 30, 1964 (78 Stat. 188), fixed the beneficial 
ownership of the Colorado River Reservation in the Colorado River Indian 
Tribes of the Colorado River Reservation and authorized the Secretary of 
the Interior to approve leases of said lands for such uses and terms as 
are authorized by the Act of August 9, 1955 (69 Stat. 539), as amended 
(25 U.S.C. 415, et seq.), including the same uses and terms as are 
permitted thereby on the Agua Caliente (Palm Springs), Dania, Navajo, 
and Southern Ute Reservations. Regulations in this part 162 govern 
leasing under the Act of August 9, 1955. Therefore, part 162 shall also 
govern the leasing of lands on the Colorado River Reservation: Provided, 
however, That application of this part 162 shall not extend to any lands 
lying west of the present course of the Colorado River and south of sec. 
12 of T. 5 S., R. 23 E., San Bernardino base and meridian in California 
and shall not be construed to affect the resolution of any controversy 
over the location of the boundary of the Colorado River Reservation; 
Provided further, That any of the described lands in California shall be 
subject to the provisions of this part 162 when and if determined to be 
within the reservation.

<R05>
Sec. 162.19  Grazing units excepted.

    Tribal or individually owned lands within range units established 
pursuant to part 166 of this chapter, general grazing regulations, shall 
not be leased and permits respecting such lands shall not be issued 
under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 162.20  San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations.

    (a) Purpose and scope. The Act of November 2, 1966 (80 Stat. 1112), 
provides statutory authority for long-term leasing on the San Xavier and 
Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, Ariz., in addition to that 
contained in the Act of August 9, 1955 (69 Stat. 539), as amended (25 
U.S.C. 415). When leases are made under the 1955 Act on the San Xavier 
or Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, the regulations in Secs. 162.1 
through 162.14 and in Sec. 162.19 apply. The purpose of this Sec. 162.20 
is to provide regulations for implementation of the 1966 Act. The 1966 
Act does not apply to

[[Page 417]]

leases made for purposes that are subject to the laws governing mining 
leases on Indian lands.
    (b) Duration of leases. Leases made under the 1966 Act for public, 
religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes 
may be made for terms of not to exceed 99 years. The terms of a grazing 
lease shall not exceed 10 years; the term of a farming lease that does 
not require the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of 
the land shall not exceed 10 years; and the term of a farming lease that 
requires the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of 
the land shall not exceed 40 years. No lease shall contain an option to 
renew which extends the total term beyond the maximum term permitted by 
this section.
    (c) Required covenant and enforcement thereof. Every lease under the 
1966 Act shall contain a covenant on the part of the lessee that he will 
not commit or permit on the leased land any act that causes waste or a 
nuisance or which creates a hazard to health of persons or to property 
wherever such persons or property may be.
    (d) Notification regarding leasing proposals. If the Secretary 
determines that a proposed lease to be made under the 1966 Act for 
public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business 
purposes will substantially affect the governmental interests of a 
municipality contiguous to the San Xavier Reservation or the Salt River 
Pima-Maricopa Reservation, as the case may be, he shall notify the 
appropriate authority of such municipality of the pendency of the 
proposed lease. The Secretary may, in his discretion, furnish such 
municipality with an outline of the major provisions of the lease which 
affect its governmental interests and shall consider any comments on the 
terms of the lease affecting the municipality or on the absence of such 
terms from the lease that the authorities may offer. The notice to the 
authorities of the municipality shall set forth a reasonable period, not 
to exceed 30 days, within which any such comments shall be submitted.
    (e) Applicability of other regulations. The regulations of 
Secs. 162.1 through 162.14 and in Sec. 162.19 shall apply to leases made 
under the 1966 Act except where such regulations are inconsistent with 
this Sec. 162.20.
    (f) Mission San Xavier del Bac. Nothing in the 1966 Act authorizes 
development that would detract from the scenic, historic, and religious 
values of the Mission San Xavier del Bac owned by the Franciscan Order 
of Friars Minor and located on the San Xavier Reservation.

    (2) A cash bond designating the approving officer to act as trustee 
under terms of an appropriate trust;
    (3) Negotiable U.S. Government securities supported by an 
appropriate trust instrument; or
    (4) An irrevocable letter of credit.


<R05>
Sec. 163.22  Payment for forest products.

    (a) The basis of volume determination for forest products sold shall 
be the Scribner Decimal C log rules, cubic volume, lineal measurement, 
piece count, weight, or such other form of measurement as the Secretary 
may authorize for use. With the exception of Indian tribal forest 
enterprises pursuant to Sec. 163.13 of this part, payment for forest 
products will be required in advance of cutting for timber, or removal 
for other forest products.
    (b) Upon the request of an Indian tribe, the Secretary may provide 
that the purchaser of the forest products of such tribe, which are 
harvested under a timber sale contract, permit, or other harvest sale 
document to make advanced deposits, or direct payments of the gross 
proceeds of such forest products, less any amounts segregated as forest 
management deductions pursuant to Sec. 163.25 of this part, into 
accounts designated by such Indian tribe. Such accounts may be in one or 
more of the following formats:
    (1) Escrow accounts at a tribally designated financial institution 
for receiving deposits with bids and advance deposits from which direct 
disbursements for timber harvested shall be made to tribes and forest 
management deductions accounts; or
    (2) Tribal depository accounts for receiving advance payments, 
installment payments, payments from Indian tribal forest enterprises, 
and/or disbursements from advance deposit accounts or escrow accounts.
    (c) The format must allow the Secretary to maintain trust 
responsibility through written verification that all required deposits, 
payments, and disbursements have been made.
    (d) Terms and conditions for payment of forest products under lump 
sum (predetermined volume) sales shall be specified in forest product 
contract documents.


<R05>
Sec. 163.23  Advance payment for timber products.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, and except in the 
case of lump sum (predetermined volume) sales, contracts for the sale of 
timber from allotted, trust or restricted Indian forest land shall 
provide for an advance payment of up to 25 percent of the stumpage 
value, calculated at the bid price, within 30 days from the date of 
approval and before cutting begins. Additional advance payments may be

[[Page 427]]

specified in contracts. However, no advance payment will be required 
that would make the sum of such payment and of advance deposits and 
advance payments previously applied against timber cut from each 
ownership in a sale exceed 50 percent of the bid stumpage value. Advance 
payments shall be credited against the timber of each ownership in the 
sale as the timber is cut and scaled at stumpage rates governing at the 
time of scaling. Advance payments are not refundable.
    (b) Advance payments may be required on tribal land. When required, 
advance payments will operate the same as provided for in Sec. 163.23(a) 
of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 163.24  Duration of timber contracts.

    After the effective date of a forest product contract, unless 
otherwise authorized by the Secretary, the maximum period which shall be 
allowed for harvesting the estimated volume of timber purchased, shall 
be five years.


<R05>
Sec. 163.25  Forest management deductions.

    (a) Pursuant to the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 413 and 25 U.S.C. 3105, 
a forest management deduction shall be withheld from the gross proceeds 
of sales of forest products harvested from Indian forest land as 
described in this section.
    (b) Gross proceeds shall mean the value in money or money's worth of 
consideration furnished by the purchaser of forest products purchased 
under a contract, permit, or other document for the sale of forest 
products.
    (c) Forest management deductions shall not be withheld where the 
total consideration furnished under a contract, permit or other document 
for the sale of forest products is less than $5,001.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 163.25(e) of this part, the amount of 
the forest management deduction shall not exceed the lesser amount of 
ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds or, the actual percentage in 
effect on November 28, 1990.
    (e) The Secretary may increase the forest management deduction 
percentage for Indian forest land upon receipt of a written request from 
a tribe supported by a resolution executed by the authorized tribal 
representatives. At the request of the authorized tribal representatives 
and at the discretion of the Secretary the forest management deduction 
percentage may be decreased to not less than one percent (1%) or the 
requirement for collection may be waived.
    (f) Forest management deductions are to be utilized to perform 
forest land management activities in accordance with an approved 
expenditure plan. Expenditure plans shall describe the forest land 
management activities anticipated to be undertaken, establish a time 
period for their completion, summarize anticipated obligations and 
expenditures, and specify the method through which funds are to be 
transferred or credited to tribal accounts from special deposit accounts 
established to hold amounts withheld as forest management deductions. 
Any forest management deductions that have not been incorporated into an 
approved expenditure plan by the end of the fiscal year following the 
fiscal year in which the deductions are withheld, shall be collected 
into the general funds of the United States Treasury pursuant to 25 
U.S.C. 413.
    (1) For Indian forest lands located on an Indian reservation, a 
written expenditure plan for the use of forest management deductions 
shall be prepared annually and approved by the authorized tribal 
representative(s) and the Secretary. The approval of the expenditure 
plan by the authorized tribal representatives constitutes allocation of 
tribal funds for Indian forest land management activities. Approval of 
the expenditure plan by the Secretary shall constitute authority for 
crediting of forest management deductions to tribal account(s). The full 
amount of any deduction collected by the Secretary plus any income or 
interest earned thereon shall be available for expenditure according to 
the approved expenditure plan for the performance of forest land 
management activities on the reservation from which the forest 
management deduction is collected.
    (2) Forest management deductions shall be handled in the same manner 
as described under Sec. 163.25(f)(1) of this part if the expenditure 
plan approved by an Indian tribe and the Secretary provides

[[Page 428]]

for the conduct of forest land management activities on Indian forest 
lands located outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation.
    (3) For public domain and Alaska Native allotments held in trust for 
Indians by the United States, forest management deductions may be 
utilized to perform forest land management activities on such lands in 
accordance with an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary.
    (g) Forest management deductions withheld pursuant to this section 
shall not be available to cover the costs that are paid from funds 
appropriated for fire suppression or pest control or otherwise offset 
federal appropriations for meeting the Federal trust responsibility for 
management of Indian forest land.
    (h) Within 120 days after the close of the tribal fiscal year, 
tribes shall submit to the Secretary a written report detailing the 
actual expenditure of forest management deductions during the past 
fiscal year. The Secretary shall have the right to inspect accounts, 
books, or other tribal records supporting the report.
    (i) Forest management deductions incorporated into an expenditure 
plan approved by the Secretary shall remain available until expended.
    (j) As provided in Sec. 163.25(f) of this part, only forest 
management deductions that have not been incorporated into an approved 
expenditure plan may be deposited to a U.S. Treasury miscellaneous 
receipt account. No amount collected as forest management deductions 
shall be credited to any Federal appropriation. No other forest 
management deductions or fees derived from Indian forest land shall be 
collected to be covered into the general funds of the United States 
Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 163.26  Forest product harvesting permits.

    (a) Except as provided in Secs. 163.13 and 163.27 of this part, 
removal of forest products that are not under formal contract, pursuant 
to Sec. 163.19, shall be under forest product harvesting permit forms 
approved by the Secretary. Permits will be issued only with the written 
consent of the beneficial Indian owner(s) or the Secretary, for harvest 
of forest products from Indian forest land, as authorized in Sec. 163.20 
of this part. To be valid, permits must be approved by the Secretary. 
Minimum stumpage rates at which forest products may be sold will be set 
at the time consent to issue the permit is obtained. Payment and bonding 
requirements will be stipulated in the permit document as appropriate.
    (b) Free use harvesting permits issued shall specify species and 
types of forest products to be removed. It may be stipulated that forest 
products removed under this authority cannot be sold or exchanged for 
other goods or services. The estimated value which may be harvested in a 
fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed 
$5,000. For the purpose of issuance of free use permits, individual 
shall mean an individual Indian or any organized group of Indians.
    (c) Paid permits subject to forest management deductions, as 
provided in Sec. 163.25 of this part, may be issued. Unless otherwise 
authorized by the Secretary, the stumpage value which may be harvested 
under paid permits in a fiscal year by any individual under this 
authority shall not exceed $25,000. For the purpose of issuance of paid 
permits, individual shall mean an individual or any operating entity 
comprised of more than one individual.
    (d) A Special Allotment Timber Harvest Permit may be issued to an 
Indian having sole beneficial interest in an allotment to harvest and 
sell designated forest products from his or her allotment. The special 
permit shall include provision for payment by the Indian of forest 
management deductions pursuant to Sec. 163.25 of this part. Unless 
waived by the Secretary, the permit shall also require the Indian to 
make a bond deposit with the Secretary as required by Sec. 163.21. Such 
bonds will be returned to the Indian upon satisfactory completion of the 
permit or will be used by the Secretary in his or her discretion for 
planting or other work to offset damage to the land or the timber caused 
by failure to comply with the provisions of the permit. As a condition 
to granting a special permit under authority of this paragraph, the 
Indian shall be required to provide evidence acceptable to the Secretary 
that

[[Page 429]]

he or she has arranged a bona fide sale of the forest products, on terms 
that will protect the Indian's interests.


<R05>
Sec. 163.27  Free-use harvesting without permits.

    With the consent of the beneficial Indian owners and the Secretary, 
Indians may harvest designated types of forest products from Indian 
forest land without a permit or contract, and without charge. Forest 
products harvested under this authority shall be for the Indian's 
personal use, and shall not be sold or exchanged for other goods or 
services.


<R05>
Sec. 163.28  Fire management measures.

    (a) The Secretary is authorized to maintain facilities and staff, 
hire temporary labor, rent fire fighting equipment, purchase tools and 
supplies, and pay for their transportation as needed, to maintain an 
adequate level of readiness to meet normal wildfire protection needs and 
extinguish forest or range fires on Indian land. No expenses for 
fighting a fire outside Indian lands may be incurred unless the fire 
threatens Indian land or unless the expenses are incurred pursuant to an 
approved cooperative agreement with another protection agency. The rates 
of pay for fire fighters and for equipment rental shall be the rates for 
fire fighting services that are currently in use by public and private 
wildfire protection agencies adjacent to Indian reservations on which a 
fire occurs, unless there are in effect at the time different rates that 
have been approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may also enter into 
reciprocal agreements with any fire organization maintaining protection 
facilities in the vicinity of Indian reservations or other Indian land 
for mutual aid in wildfire protection. This section does not apply to 
the rendering of emergency aid, or agreements for mutual aid in fire 
protection pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (69 Stat. 66).
    (b) The Secretary is authorized to conduct a wildfire prevention 
program to reduce the number of person-caused fires and prevent damage 
to natural resources on Indian land.
    (c) The Secretary is authorized to expend funds for emergency 
rehabilitation measures needed to stabilize soil and watershed on Indian 
land damaged by wildfire.
    (d) Upon consultation with the beneficial Indian owners, the 
Secretary may use fire as a management tool on Indian land to achieve 
land and/or resource management objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 163.29   Trespass.

    (a) Trespassers will be liable for civil penalties and damages to 
the enforcement agency and the beneficial Indian owners, and will be 
subject to prosecution for acts of trespass.
    (1) Cases in Tribal Court. For trespass actions brought in tribal 
court pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil 
penalties, remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this 
Sec. 163.29 of this part. All other aspects of a tribal trespass 
prosecution brought under these regulations will be that prescribed by 
the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction 
the trespass was committed, unless otherwise prescribed under federal 
law. Absent applicable tribal or federal law, the measure of damages 
shall be that prescribed by the law of the state in which the trespass 
was committed.
    (2) Cases in Federal Court. For trespass actions brought in Federal 
court pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil 
penalties, remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this 
Sec. 163.29. In the absence of applicable federal law, the measure shall 
be that prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or 
within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, or in the absence 
of tribal law, the law of the state in which it was committed.
    (3) Civil penalties for trespass include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Treble damages, whenever any person, without lawful authority 
injures, severs, or carries off from a reservation any forest product as 
defined in Sec. 163.1 of this part. Proof of Indian ownership of the 
premises and commission of the acts by the trespasser are prima facie 
evidence sufficient to support liability for treble damages, with no 
requirement to show willfulness or intent. Treble damages shall be based

[[Page 430]]

upon the highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials 
involved in the trespass.
    (ii) Payment of costs associated with damage to Indian forest land 
includes, but is not limited to, rehabilitation, reforestation, lost 
future revenue and lost profits, loss of productivity, and damage to 
other forest resources.
    (iii) Payment of all reasonable costs associated with the 
enforcement of these trespass regulations beginning with detection and 
including all processes through the prosecution and collection of 
damages, including but not limited to field examination and survey, 
damage appraisal, investigation assistance and reports, witness 
expenses, demand letters, court costs, and attorney fees.
    (iv) Interest calculated at the statutory rate prescribed by the law 
of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the 
trespass was committed, or in the absence of tribal law in the amount 
prescribed by federal law. Where tribal law or federal law does not 
supply a statutory interest rate, the rate of interest shall be 
statutory rate upon judgments as prescribed by the law of the state in 
which the trespass was committed. Interest shall be based on treble the 
highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials involved in the 
trespass, and calculated from the date of the trespass until payment is 
rendered.
    (b) Any cash or other proceeds realized from forfeiture of equipment 
or other goods or from forest products damaged or taken in the trespass 
shall be applied to satisfy civil penalties and other damages identified 
under Sec. 163.29(a) of this part. After disposition of real and 
personal property to pay civil penalties and damages resulting from 
trespass, any residual funds shall be returned to the trespasser. In the 
event that collection and forfeiture actions taken against the 
trespasser result in less than full recovery, civil penalties shall be 
distributed as follows:
    (1) Collection of damages up to the highest stumpage value of the 
trespass products shall be distributed pro rata between the Indian 
beneficial owners and any costs and expenses needed to restore the 
trespass land; or
    (2) Collections exceeding the highest stumpage value of the trespass 
product, but less than full recovery, shall be proportionally 
distributed pro rata between the Indian beneficial owners, the law 
enforcement agency, and the cost to restore the trespass land. Forest 
management deductions shall not be withheld where less than the highest 
stumpage value of the unprocessed forest products taken in trespass has 
been recovered.
    (c) Indian beneficial owners who trespass, or who are involved in 
trespass upon their own land, or undivided land in which such owners 
have a partial interest, shall not receive their beneficial share of any 
civil penalties and damages collected in consequence of the trespass. 
Any civil penalties and damages defaulted in consequence of this 
provision instead shall be distributed first toward restoration of the 
land subject of the trespass and second toward costs of the enforcement 
agency in consequence of the trespass, with any remainder to the forest 
management deduction account of the reservation in which the trespass 
took place.
    (d) Civil penalties and other damages collected under these 
regulations, except for penalties and damages provided for in 
Secs. 163.29(a)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this part, shall be treated as 
proceeds from the sale of forest products from the Indian forest land 
upon which the trespass occurred.
    (e) When a federal official or authorized tribal representative 
pursuant to Sec. 163.29(j) of this part has reason to believe that 
Indian forest products are involved in trespass, such individual may 
seize and take possession of the forest products involved in the 
trespass if the products are located on reservation. When forest 
products are seized, the person seizing the products must at the time of 
the seizure issue a Notice of Seizure to the possessor or claimant of 
the forest products. The Notice of Seizure shall indicate the date of 
the seizure, a description of the forest products seized, the estimated 
value of forest products seized, an indication of whether the forest 
products are perishable, and the name and authority of the person 
seizing the forest products. Where the official initiates seizure

[[Page 431]]

under these regulations only, the Notice of Seizure shall further 
include the statement that any challenge or objection to the seizure 
shall be exclusively through administrative appeal pursuant to part 2 of 
title 25, and shall provide the name and the address of the official 
with whom the appeal may be filed. Alternately, an official may exercise 
concurrent tribal seizure authority under these regulations using 
applicable tribal law. In such case, the Notice of Seizure shall 
identify the tribal law under which the seizure may be challenged, if 
any. A copy of a Notice of Seizure shall be given to the possessor or 
claimant at the time of the seizure. If the claimant or possessor is 
unknown or unavailable, Notice of Seizure shall be posted on the 
trespass property, and a copy of the Notice shall be kept with any 
incident report generated by the official seizing the forest products. 
If the property seized is perishable and will lose substantial value if 
not sold or otherwise disposed of, the representative of the Secretary, 
or authorized tribal representative where deferral has been requested, 
may cause the forest products to be sold. Such sale action shall not be 
stayed by the filing of an administrative appeal nor by a challenge of 
the seizure action through a tribal forum. All proceeds from the sale of 
the forest products shall be placed into an escrow account and held 
until adjudication or other resolution of the underlying trespass. If it 
is found that the forest products seized were involved in a trespass, 
the proceeds shall be applied to the amount of civil penalties and 
damages awarded. If it is found that a trespass has not occurred or the 
proceeds are in excess of the amount of the judgment awarded, the 
proceeds or excess proceeds shall be returned to the possessor or 
claimant.
    (f) When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are 
involved in trespass and that such products have been removed to land 
not under federal or tribal government supervision, the federal official 
or authorized tribal representative pursuant to Sec. 163.29(k) of this 
part responsible for the trespass shall immediately provide the 
following notice to the owner of the land or the party in possession of 
the trespass products:
    (1) That such products could be Indian trust property involved in a 
trespass; and
    (2) That removal or disposition of the forest products may result in 
criminal and/or civil action by the United States or tribe.
    (g) A representative of the Secretary or authorized tribal 
representative pursuant to Sec. 163.29(j) of this part will promptly 
determine if a trespass has occurred. The appropriate representative 
will issue an official Notice of Trespass to the alleged trespasser and, 
if necessary, the possessor or potential buyer of any trespass products. 
The Notice is intended to inform the trespasser, buyer, or the 
processor:
    (1) That a determination has been made that a trespass has occurred;
    (2) The basis for the determination;
    (3) An assessment of the damages, penalties and costs;
    (4) Of the seizure of forest products, if applicable; and
    (5) That disposition or removal of Indian forest products taken in 
the trespass may result in civil and/or criminal action by the United 
States or the tribe.
    (h) The Secretary may accept payment of damages in the settlement of 
civil trespass cases. In the absence of a court order, the Secretary 
will determine the procedure and approve acceptance of any settlements 
negotiated by a tribe exercising its concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to 
Sec. 163.29(j) of this part.
    (i) The Secretary may delegate by written agreement or contract, 
responsibility for detection and investigation of forest trespass.
    (j) Indian tribes that adopt the regulations set forth in this 
section, conformed as necessary to tribal law, shall have concurrent 
civil jurisdiction to enforce 25 U.S.C. 3106 and this section against 
any person.
    (1) The Secretary shall acknowledge said concurrent civil 
jurisdiction over trespass, upon:
    (i) Receipt of a formal tribal resolution documenting the tribe's 
adoption of this section; and
    (ii) Notification of the ability of the tribal court system to 
properly adjudicate forest trespass cases, including a

[[Page 432]]

statement that the tribal court will enforce the Indian Civil Rights Act 
or a tribal civil rights law that contains provisions for due process 
and equal protection that are similar to or stronger than those 
contained in the Indian Civil Rights Act.
    (2) Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction 
over trespass cases as set forth in Sec. 163.29(j)(1) of this part, the 
Secretary and tribe's authorized representatives will be jointly 
responsible to coordinate prosecution of trespass actions. The Secretary 
shall, upon timely request of the tribe, defer prosecution of forest 
trespasses to the tribe. Where said deferral is not requested, the 
designated Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry trespass official shall 
coordinate with the authorized forest trespass official of each tribe 
the exercise of concurrent tribal and Federal trespass jurisdiction as 
to each trespass. Such officials shall review each case, determine in 
which forums to recommend bringing an action, and promptly provide their 
recommendation to the Federal officials responsible for initiating and 
prosecuting forest trespass cases. Where an Indian tribe has acquired 
concurrent civil jurisdiction, but does not request deferral of 
prosecution, the federal officials responsible for initiating and 
prosecuting such cases may file and prosecute the action in the tribal 
court or forum.
    (3) The Secretary may rescind an Indian tribe's concurrent civil 
jurisdiction over trespass cases under this regulation if the Secretary 
or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the tribal court 
has not adhered to the due process or equal protection requirements of 
the Indian Civil Rights Act. If it is determined that said rescission is 
justified, the Secretary shall provide written Notice of the rescission, 
including the findings justifying the rescission and the steps needed to 
remedy the violations causing the rescission, to the chief judge of the 
tribal judiciary or other authorized tribal official should there be no 
chief judge. If said steps are not taken within 60 days, the Secretary's 
rescission of concurrent civil jurisdiction shall become final. The 
affected tribe(s) may appeal a Notice of Rescission under part 2 of 
title 25.
    (4) Nothing shall be construed to prohibit or in any way diminish 
the authority of a tribe to prosecute individuals under its criminal or 
civil trespass laws where it has jurisdiction over those individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 163.30  Revocable road use and construction permits for removal of commercial forest products.

    (a) In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 415 as amended, the Secretary may 
request tribes and/or other beneficial owners to sign revocable permits 
designating the Secretary as agent for the landowner and empowering him 
or her to issue revocable road use and construction permits to users for 
the purpose of removing forest products.
    (b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the 
Secretary may issue revocable road use and con- struction permits for 
removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the 
Secretary may act for individual owners when:
    (1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an 
interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis, and the 
Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, 
will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner, which cannot 
be adequately compensated for by monetary damages;
    (2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or those with an 
interest therein are unknown so long as the majority of owner(s) of 
interests whose whereabouts are known, consent to the grant;
    (3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or 
interest have not been determined, and the Secretary finds the grant 
will cause no substantial injury to the land or any land owner; or
    (4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the 
Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the consent of the 
majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will 
cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner(s), that cannot be 
adequately compensated for by monetary damages.

[[Page 433]]

    (c) Nothing in this section shall preclude acquisition of rights-of-
way over Indian lands, under 25 CFR part 169, or conflict with 
provisions of that part.

Sec. 163.31  Insect and disease control.

    (a) The Secretary is authorized to protect and preserve Indian 
forest land from disease or insects (Sept. 20, 1922, Ch. 349, 42 Stat. 
857). The Secretary shall consult with the authorized tribal 
representatives and beneficial owners of Indian forest land concerning 
control actions.
    (b) The Secretary is responsible for controlling and mitigating 
harmful effects of insects and diseases on Indian forest land and will 
coordinate control actions with the Secretary of Agriculture in 
accordance with 92 Stat. 365, 16 U.S.C. 2101.


<R05>
Sec. 163.32  Forest development.

    Forest development pertains to forest land management activities 
undertaken to improve the sustainable productivity of commercial Indian 
forest land. The program shall consist of reforestation, timber stand 
improvement projects, and related investments to enhance productivity of 
commercial forest land with emphasis on accomplishing on-the-ground 
projects. Forest development funds will be used to re-establish, 
maintain, and/or improve growth of commercial timber species and control 
stocking levels on commercial forest land. Forest development activities 
will be planned and executed using benefit-cost analyses as one of the 
determinants in establishing priorities for project funding.


<R05>
Sec. 163.33  Administrative appeals.

    Any challenge to action under 25 CFR part 163 taken by an approving 
officer or subordinate official exercising delegated authority from the 
Secretary shall be exclusively through administrative appeal or as 
provided in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 
(Pub. L. 93-638, as amended). Such appeal(s) shall be filed in 
accordance with the provisions of 25 CFR part 2, Appeals from 
administrative actions, except that an appeal of any action under part 
163 of this title shall:
    (a) Not stay any action unless otherwise directed by the Secretary; 
and
    (b) Define ``interested party'' for purposes of bringing such an 
appeal or participating in such an appeal as any person whose own direct 
economic interest is adversely affected by an action or decision.


<R05>
Sec. 163.34  Environmental compliance.

    Actions taken by the Secretary under the regulations in this part 
must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,

annually, or whose forest resource is determined by the Secretary to be 
of significant commercial timber value.
    (3) Category 3 includes significant woodland reservations comprised 
of an identifiable trust or restricted forest area of any size which is 
lacking a timberland component, and whose forest resource is determined 
by the Secretary to be of significant commercial woodland value.
    (c) A group of tribes that has either established or intends to 
establish a cooperative tribal forestry program to provide forest land 
management services to their reservations may apply and qualify for 
tribal forestry program financial support. For purposes of financial 
support under this provision, the cooperative tribal forestry program 
and the commercial forest acreage and annual allowable cut which it 
represents may be considered as a single reservation.
    (d) Before the beginning of each Federal fiscal year, tribes 
applying to qualify for forestry program financial support shall submit 
application packages to the Secretary which:
    (1) Document that a tribal forestry program exists or that there is 
an intent to establish such a program;

<R05>
Sec. 166.2  General authority.

    It is within the authority of the Secretary to protect individually 
owned and tribal lands against waste and to prescribe rules and 
regulations under

[[Page 445]]

which these lands may be leased or permitted for grazing. Improper use 
which threatens destruction of the range and soil resource is properly 
considered waste. With respect to reservations upon which the Indian 
Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984), is applicable, the 
action of the Secretary must follow the directions in section 6 of that 
Act which are: ``The Secretary of the Interior is directed to make rules 
and regulations for the operation and maintenance of Indian forestry 
units on the principle of sustained-yield management, to restrict the 
number of livestock grazed on Indian range units to the estimated 
carrying capacity of such ranges, and to promulgate such other rules and 
regulations as may be necessary to protect the range from deterioration, 
to prevent soil erosion, to assure full utilization of the range, and 
like purposes.'' It is also the Secretary's responsibility to improve 
the economic well being of the Indian people through proper and 
efficient resource use.


<R05>
Sec. 166.3  Objectives.

    It is the purpose of the regulations of this part to:
    (a) Preserve, through proper grazing management, the land, water, 
forest, forage, wildlife, and recreational values on the reservations 
and improve and build up these resources where they have deteriorated.
    (b) Promote use of the range resource by Indians to enable them to 
earn a living, in whole or in part, through the grazing of their own 
livestock.
    (c) Provide for the administration of grazing privileges in a manner 
which will yield the highest return consistent with sustained yield land 
management principles and the fulfillment of the rights and objectives 
of tribal governing bodies and individual land owners.


<R05>
Sec. 166.4  Regulations; scope; exceptions.

    The grazing regulations of this part apply to individually owned, 
tribal, and Government lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, except as superseded by special written instructions 
from the Commissioner in particular instances, or by provisions of any 
tribal constitution, bylaws, or charter, heretofore duly ratified or 
approved, or by any tribal action authorized thereunder. All forms 
necessary to carry out the purpose of the regulations of this part shall 
be approved by the Commissioner. Grazing lands not in range units 
established under this part may be leased pursuant to part 162 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 166.5  Establishment of range units.

    The conservation, development, and effective utilization of the 
range resource requires consolidation of small individual and tribal 
ownerships and the organization of the total range area into management 
units. This shall be done under the direction of the Superintendent, 
after consultation with the Indians, in a manner which will best meet 
the requirements of Indian needs, land ownership status, and proper land 
use. Any contiguous block of Indian and Government rangeland in excess 
of 2,560 acres shall be designated as one or more range units. Range 
units smaller than 2,560 acres may also be established under this 
procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 166.6  Grazing capacity.

    Subject to approval of the Area Director, the Superintendent shall 
prescribe the maximum number of livestock which may be grazed on each 
range unit and the season, or seasons, of use to achieve the objectives 
cited in Sec. 166.3. The grazing capacity so prescribed will take into 
consideration the implementation of tribal objectives and programs 
requiring grazeable land to support wildlife and other nonlivestock 
uses. Stocking rates shall be reviewed on a continuing basis and 
adjusted as conditions warrant.


<R05>
Sec. 166.7  Grazing on range units authorized by permit.

    All grazing use of range units shall be authorized by a grazing 
permit except Indians' use of their own land pursuant to Sec. 166.8. 
Permits on range units containing trust or restricted land which is 
entirely tribally owned, or is in combination with Government land, may 
be issued by the governing body, subject to approval by the 
Superintendent, or by the Superintendent pursuant to Sec. 166.9 (b). The 
Superintendent shall issue all permits on

[[Page 446]]

range units containing trust or restricted land which is entirely 
individually owned or is in combination with tribal and or Government 
land.

[34 FR 9383, June 14, 1969; 34 FR 11263, July 4, 1969. Redesignated at 
47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 166.8  Grazing exempt from permit.

    Adult tribal members of any tribe may, without approval of the 
Superintendent, graze livestock on their own individually owned grazing 
land or other grazing land for which they are responsible on behalf of 
those non compos mentis, on behalf of their minor children and on behalf 
of minor children or others to whom they stand in loco parentis when 
such children do not have a legal representative. The term ``graze 
livestock'' means the grazing of livestock which are either owned by 
those persons listed above, or if not owned, are under their direct 
management and supervision. Grazing of livestock under any other 
arrangement requires approval of the Superintendent.


<R05>
Sec. 166.9  Authority of the Superintendent to include land in grazing permits.

    (a) The Superintendent may include individually owned land in 
grazing permits on behalf of:
    (1) Orphaned minors;
    (2) Persons who are non compos mentis and without legal guardians;
    (3) Undetermined heirs or devisees of a deceased Indian owner;
    (4) Adults whose whereabouts are unknown;
    (5) Heirs or devisees, none of whom are using the land and who have 
not been able to agree upon the permitting of their land during a 3-
month period, and after notice from the Superintendent given by posting 
a general notice in all Post Offices on the reservation and with the 
tribal governing body;
    (6) Those Indian land owners listed in Sec. 166.8 who give the 
Superintendent written authority to grant grazing privileges; and
    (7) Any other Indian minor or person who is non compos mentis or 
otherwise under legal disability, if that person's guardian, 
conservator, or other fiduciary, appointed by a State court or by a 
tribal court or court of Indian offenses operating under an approved 
constitution or law and order code, gives the Superintendent written 
authority to grant grazing privileges.
    (b) The Superintendent may include tribal land in grazing permits on 
behalf of governing bodies who give written authority. When timely 
action is not taken by the governing body to give the Superintendent 
written authority, or to issue permits pursuant to Sec. 166.7 and the 
criteria prescribed in Sec. 166.10, the Superintendent may proceed to 
issue permits on tribal land, subject to veto of the governing body, in 
order to prevent resource waste or unreasonable economic loss to the 
tribe or its members. The Superintendent shall notify the governing body 
in writing of the action he proposes to take and allow a 60-day period 
during which the tribal veto may be exercised.
    (c) The Superintendent may include Government land in grazing 
permits provided such land is not already under revocable permit to the 
tribe, in which case, paragraph (b) of this section applies.


<R05>
Sec. 166.10  Allocation of grazing privileges.

    A tribal governing body may authorize the allocation of grazing 
privileges without competitive bidding on tribal and tribally controlled 
Government land to Indian corporations, Indian associations, and adult 
tribal members of the tribe represented by that governing body. The 
Superintendent may implement the governing body's allocation program by 
authorizing the allocation of grazing privileges on individually owned 
land. The eligibility requirements for allocations shall be prescribed 
by the governing body, subject to written concurrence of the 
Superintendent. Where timely action is not taken by the governing body 
to prescribe satisfactory requirements, the Superintendent shall notify 
it in writing that it has a 60-day period during which it may present 
requirements. Subject to the approval of the Area Director, the 
Superintendent shall prescribe the eligibility requirements after 
expiration of the 60-day period in

[[Page 447]]

the event satisfactory action is not taken by the governing body.

<R05>
Sec. 166.11  Competitive and negotiated sale of grazing privileges.

    (a) Grazing privileges not exempt from permit under Sec. 166.8 and 
not reserved for allocation under Sec. 166.10 shall be advertised for 
competitive public sale by the Superintendent except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Advertisements shall be:
    (1) Approved by the Area Director prior to publication;
    (2) Shall be for a 30-day period unless otherwise authorized by the 
Area Director;
    (3) Shall call for sealed bids;
    (4) May provide for oral auction subsequent to sealed bid opening at 
the discretion of the governing body; and
    (5) Shall limit the privilege of meeting high sealed bids of non-
Indians to adult tribal members, Indian corporations, and Indian 
associations, according to preferences determined by the governing body 
and concurred in writing by the Area Director.
    (b) The Area Director may authorize the issuance of grazing permits 
by negotiation when in his discretion no useful purpose would be served 
by advertisement. Negotiated permits shall be limited to the grazing 
capacity established pursuant to Sec. 166.6.

[34 FR 9383, June 14, 1969; 34 FR 11263, July 4, 1969. Redesignated at 
47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 166.12  Kind of livestock.

    (a) Tribal governing bodies may determine, subject to the grazing 
capacity prescribed by the Superintendent and Area Director the kind of 
livestock, e.g., cattle, sheep, etc., that may be grazed on range units 
composed entirely of tribal land or in combination with Government land.
    (b) The Superintendent shall designate the same kind of livestock to 
be grazed on range units composed entirely of individually owned land, 
or in combination with tribal and or Government land, as that determined 
by governing bodies pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, unless 
the principles of proper land management or efficient permit 
administration require otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 166.13  Establishment of grazing fees.

    (a) Tribal governing bodies may determine the minimum rental rate to 
be charged for the use of tribal lands (1) included in advertisements 
for public sale and (2) by allocation, except that allocated Indian 
permittees shall be required to pay not less than the reservation 
minimum rental rate established by the Area Director pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section for all non-Indian owned livestock which 
they may be authorized to graze on tribal lands. Prior to these 
determinations, the Superintendent shall provide the tribe with all 
available information including appraisal data concerning the value of 
grazing on tribal lands.
    (b) The Area Director shall establish a reservation minimum 
acceptable grazing rental rate. The reservation minimum rate shall apply 
to all grazing privileges permitted on individually owned lands, to non-
Indian owned livestock which allocated permittees may be authorized to 
graze on tribal lands, and to all tribal lands when the governing body 
fails to establish a rate pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rate 
established shall provide a fair annual return to the land owners.
    (c) Indian landowners, in giving the Superintendent written 
authority to grant grazing privileges on their individually owned land, 
may stipulate a minimum rate above the reservation minimum set by the 
Area Director if justified because of above average value. They may also 
stipulate a lower rate than the reservation minimum, subject to approval 
of the Superintendent when the permittee is a member of the landowner's 
immediate family.


<R05>
Sec. 166.14  Duration of grazing permits.

    (a) Tribal governing bodies may determine the duration of grazing 
permits on range units composed entirely of tribal land or in 
combination with Government land, subject to a maximum period of 5 years 
except when substantial development or improvement

[[Page 448]]

is required, in which case the maximum period shall be 10 years.
    (b) Subject to the same duration limits set forth in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Superintendent shall prescribe the same period of 
duration for permits on range units composed entirely of individually 
owned land, or in combination with tribal and/or Government land, as 
that determined by governing bodies pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section unless the principles of proper land management or efficient 
permit administration require otherwise.
    (c) Permits for a period in excess of 5 years shall provide for 
review of the grazing fees by the Superintendent at the end of the first 
5 years and for adjustment as necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 166.15  Assignment, modification, and cancellation of permits.

    (a) Grazing permits shall not be assigned, subpermitted, or 
transferred without the consent of the contracting parties, including 
the surety, and the approval of the Superintendent.
    (b) The Superintendent may revoke or withdraw all or any part of a 
grazing permit by cancellation or modification on 30 days' written 
notice for violation of the permit or because of termination of trust 
status of permitted land. In case of cancellation or modification 
because of trust termination the action shall be effected on the next 
annual anniversary date of the grazing permit following the date of 
notice.
    (c) The Superintendent may revoke or withdraw all or any part of a 
grazing permit by cancellation or modification on 180 days' written 
notice for allocated Indian use or for grazing exempt from permit 
pursuant to Sec. 166.8. Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the 
interested parties, such actions shall be effected on the annual 
anniversary date of the grazing permit following the date of notice 
except when such timeliness of notice is not possible, in which case 
deferment of the intended action shall not be required to extend beyond 
180 days from the date of the notice. Rental fees for grazing privileges 
taken for allocation shall not be less than those paid by the preceding 
permittee.


<R05>
Sec. 166.16  Conservation and land use provisions.

    Grazing operations shall be conducted in accordance with recognized 
principles of good range management. Stipulations or management plans 
necessary to accomplish this may be made a part of the grazing permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.17  Range improvements; ownership.

    Improvements placed on the permitted land shall be considered 
affixed to the land unless specifically excepted therefrom under the 
permit terms. Written permission to construct and to remove improvements 
must be secured from the Superintendent. The permit will specify the 
maximum time allowed for removal of improvements so excepted.


<R05>
Sec. 166.18  Payment of tribal fees and taxes.

    Fees and taxes exclusive of annual grazing fees, assessed by the 
tribe in connection with grazing permits and with the approval of the 
Commissioner or Secretary, shall be billed for by the tribe and paid 
annually in advance to the designated tribal official. Failure to make 
payment will subject the grazing permit to cancellation and may 
disqualify the permittee for future permits.


<R05>
Sec. 166.19  Special permit requirements and provisions.

    (a) All grazing permits shall contain the following provisions:
    (1) While the lands covered by the permit are in trust or restricted 
status, all of the permittee's obligations under the permit and the 
obligation of his sureties are to the United States as well as to the 
owner of the land.
    (2) Nothing contained in the permit shall operate to delay or 
prevent a termination of Federal trust responsibilities with respect to 
the land by the issuance of a fee patent or otherwise during the term of 
the permit.
    (3) The permittee agrees he will not use, cause, or allow to be used 
any part of the permitted area for any unlawful conduct or purpose.
    (4) The permit authorizes the grazing of livestock only and the 
permittee shall not utilize the permitted area for

[[Page 449]]

hay cutting, hunting, post or timber cutting, or any other use without 
written authorization from the responsible Indian or Federal authority.


<R05>
Sec. 166.20  Bonding and insurance requirements.

    (a) A performance bond satisfactory to the Superintendent may be 
required in an amount that will reasonably assure performance of the 
contractual obligations. A bond, when required, may be for the purpose 
of guarantying the estimated construction cost of any improvement to be 
placed on the land which will become the property of the landowner or to 
insure compliance with special or additional contractual obligations.
    (b) The permittee may be required to provide insurance in an amount 
adequate to protect any improvements on the permitted premises; and may 
also be required to furnish appropriate liability insurance and such 
other insurance as may be necessary to protect the landowner's interest.


<R05>
Sec. 166.21  Payment of annual grazing fees.

    Annual grazing fees for all grazing permits shall be paid in advance

<R05>
Sec. 166.23  On-and-off grazing privileges.

    The permittee may be allowed credit for the grazing capacity of 
other range lands not covered by the permit, but which are owned or 
controlled by him and grazed in common with the permitted lands as a 
part of the range unit. The grazing capacity will be determined by the 
Superintendent and shown on the grazing permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.24  Livestock trespass.

    (a) Acts prohibited on Indian trust, restricted or Government lands. 
The following acts are prohibited on Indian trust or restricted lands 
under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs:
    (1) The grazing upon or driving across any individually owned, 
tribal, or Government lands of any livestock without an approved grazing 
or crossing permit.
    (2) Allowing livestock to drift and graze on trust or restricted 
Indian lands without an approved permit.
    (3) The grazing or livestock upon trust or restricted Indian lands 
within an area closed to grazing of that class of livestock.
    (4) The grazing of livestock by permittee upon an area of trust or 
restricted Indian lands withdrawn from use for grazing purposes to 
protect it from damage by reason of the improper handling of livestock, 
after the receipt of notice from the Superintendent of such withdrawal, 
or refusal to remove livestock upon instructions from the Superintendent 
when an injury is being done to the Indian lands by reason of improper 
handling of livestock.
    (b) Unauthorized grazing. The owner of any livestock grazing in 
trespass on trust or restricted Indian lands is liable to a penalty of 
$1 per head for each animal thereof for each day of trespass (except in 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota where the penalty 
shall be $1 per head of cattle regardless of the number of days of 
trespass), together with the reasonable value of the forage consumed by 
their livestock and damages to property injured or destroyed, and for 
expenses incurred in impoundment and disposal. The Superintendent shall 
take action to collect all such penalties and damages, reimbursement for 
expenses incurred in impoundment and disposal,

[[Page 450]]

and seek injunctive relief when appropriate. All payments for such 
penalties and damages shall be credited to the landowners where the 
trespass occurs except that the value of forage or crops consumed or 
destroyed may be paid to the lessee of the lands not to exceed the 
rental paid, and reimbursement for expenses incurred in impoundment and 
disposal shall be credited as appropriate.
    (c) Notice and order to remove. (1) When it has been determined that 
a violation exists and the owner of the unauthorized livestock is known, 
written notice shall be served upon the alleged violator or his agent by 
certified mail with return receipt requested, or personal delivery and a 
copy of the notice shall be sent to any known lien holder. The notice 
shall set forth the act consituting the violation, the legal description 
of the land where the livestock were observed, the verification of 
brands in the State Brand Book, and the regulation alleged to have been 
violated. The notice shall also instruct the alleged violator to remove 
the livestock within a specified time, allow a specified time from 
receipt of the notice to show that there has been no violations, or to 
make settlement under Sec. 166.24(d). If the alleged violator fails to 
comply with the notice, the Superintendent may impound the livestock 
under Sec. 166.24(f).
    (2) When neither the owner of the unauthorized livestock nor his 
representative is known, the Superintendent may proceed to impound the 
livestock under Sec. 166.24(f).
    (d) Settlement. The amount due the Indian landowner and/or the 
United States in settlement for unauthorized grazing use shall be 
determined by the Superintendent as follows:
    (1) A penalty of $1 for each animal thereof for each day of 
trespass, except in the States of Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and 
South Dakota where the penalty shall be $1 for each animal without 
regard to the number of days of trespass.
    (2) A reasonable value of forage consumed based upon the average 
rate received per month for comparable grazing privileges on the 
reservation for the kind of livestock concerned, or the estimated 
commercial value for such privileges if no comparable grazing privileges 
are sold.
    (3) Damages to Indian or Government property injured or destroyed.
    (4) All expenses incurred in gathering, impounding, caring for, and 
disposing of livestock in cases which necessitate impoundment under 
Sec. 166.24(f).
    (5) Neither the imposition of any civil penalty nor any action by 
the Secretary of the Interior shall preclude either any civil action by 
the United States, an Indian, or an Indian tribe for damages caused by 
trespassing livestock or prosecution for any offense involved with such 
trespass.
    (e) Demand for payment. Where the livestock have been removed, but 
satisfactory settlement has not been made within the time prescribed 
under Sec. 166.24(c), a certified letter, return receipt requested, 
shall be sent or personally delivered to the livestock owner or his 
agent, and a copy of the letter shall be sent to any know lien holder. 
The letter shall demand immediate settlement and advise the violator 
that unless settlement is received within five working days from date of 
receipt, the case may be referred to the Department of Justice for 
appropriate action.
    (f) Impoundment and disposal. Unauthorized livestock remaining on 
trust or restricted Indian or Government lands which are not removed 
therefrom within the period prescribed in Sec. 166.24(c) may be 
impounded and disposed of by the Superintendent as provided herein:
    (1) A written notice of intent to impound shall be sent by certified 
mail, return receipt requested, or personally delivered to the owner, or 
his agent, and a copy of the notice shall be sent to any known lien 
holder. Any time after five days of delivery of the notice, the 
unauthorized livestock may be impounded.
    (2) Where the owner or his agent is unknown, or a known owner or his 
agent refuses to accept delivery of the notice, a notice of intent to 
impound shall be published in a local newspaper, posted at the nearest 
community building and tribal council headquarters, and at a post office 
near the Indian or Government lands involved. Any time after five days 
of posting of the notice,

[[Page 451]]

the unauthorized livestock may be impounded.
    (3) Unauthorized livestock that are owned by persons given notice 
under paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this section may be impounded 
without further notice any time within the 12-month period following the 
effective date of a notice given under this subsection.
    (4) Where there is imminent danger that trespassing livestock will 
severely injure a growing or harvestable crop or substantially destroy 
the range forage, the livestock may be impounded immediately.
    (g) Notice of public sale. Following the impoundment of unauthorized 
livestock, a notice of sale of impounded livestock shall be published in 
a local newspaper, posted at the nearest community building and tribal 
council headquarters, and at a post office near the Indian or Government 
lands involved. The notice will describe the livestock and specify the 
date, time and place of sale. The date set shall be at least five days 
after the publication and posting of such notice. Any known owners or 
agents and known lien holders shall be notified in writing by certified 
mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery of the sale, and 
the procedure by which the impounded livestock may be redeemed prior to 
the sale as described in Sec. 166.24(h).
    (h) Redemption. Any owner or known lien holder of the impounded 
livestock may redeem them at any time before the time set for the sale 
by submitting proof of ownership and the settlement of all obligations 
described in Sec. 166.24(d).
    (i) Sale. If the livestock are not redeemed before the time fixed 
for their sale, they shall be sold at public sale to the highest bidder. 
If a satisfactory bid is not received, the livestock may be reoffered 
for sale, condemned and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of. When 
livestock are sold by the Superintendent pursuant to these regulations, 
he shall furnish the purchaser a bill of sale or other written 
instrument evidencing the sale.
    (j) Distribution of proceeds. The net proceeds of the sale, after 
deduction of the prescribed penalty and the deduction of the necessary 
costs and expenses of the Secretary of the Interior as provided in 
Sec. 166.24(d), shall be paid to the owner of the animal upon 
satisfactory proof of ownership submitted within six months of the date 
of the sale. Net proceeds of the sale of an animal, not paid to the 
owner, shall be deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of 
the landowners where the trespass occurred.

<R05>
Sec. 167.1  Authority.

    It is within the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to 
protect Indian tribal lands against waste. Subject to regulations of 
this part, the right exists for Indian tribes to authorize the granting 
of permits upon their tribal lands and to prescribe by appropriate

[[Page 452]]

tribal action the conditions under which their lands may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 167.2  General regulations.

    Part 166 of this subchapter authorizes the Commissioner of Indian 
Affairs to regulate the grazing of livestock on Indian lands under 
conditions set forth therein. In accordance with this authority and that 
of the Navajo Tribal Council, the Central Grazing Committee and the 
District Grazing Committees, the grazing of livestock on the Navajo 
Reservation shall be governed by the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 167.3  Objectives.

    It is the purpose of the regulations in this part to aid the Navajo 
Indians in achievement of the following objectives:
    (a) The preservation of the forage, the land, and the water 
resources on the Navajo Reservation, and the building up of those 
resources where they have deteriorated.
    (b) The protection of the interests of the Navajo Indians from the 
encroachment of unduly aggressive and anti-social individuals who may or 
may not be members of the Navajo Tribe.
    (c) The adjustment of livestock numbers to the carrying capacity of 
the range in such a manner that the livestock economy of the Navajo 
Tribe will be preserved.
    (d) To secure increasing responsibility and participation of the 
Navajo people, including tribal participation in all basic policy 
decisions, in the sound management of one of the Tribe's greatest 
assets, its grazing lands, and to foster a better relationship and a 
clearer understanding between the Navajo people and the Federal 
Government in carrying out the grazing regulations.
    (e) The improvement of livestock through proper breeding practices 
and the maintenance of a sound culling policy. Buck and bull pastures 
may be established and maintained either on or off the reservation 
through District Grazing Committee and Central Grazing Committee action.


<R05>
Sec. 167.4  Regulations; scope; exceptions.

    The grazing regulations in this part apply to all lands within the 
boundaries of the Navajo Reservation held in trust by the United States 
for the Navajo Tribe and all the trust lands hereafter added to the 
Navajo Reservation. The regulations in this part do not apply to any of 
the area described in the Executive order of December 16, 1882, to 
individually owned allotted lands within the Navajo Reservation nor to 
tribal purchases, allotted or privately owned Navajo Indian lands 
outside the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Reservation.

1982]


<R05>
Sec. 167.5  Land management districts.

    The Commissioner of Indian Affairs has established and will retain 
the present land management districts within the Navajo Indian 
Reservation, based on the social and economic requirements of the Navajo 
Indians and the necessity of rehabilitating the grazing lands. District 
boundary changes may be made when deemed necessary and advisable by the 
District Grazing Committees, Central Grazing Committee and Tribal 
Council, with approval by the Superintendent, Area Director, and the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 167.6  Carrying capacities.

    (a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs on June 26, 1943, promulgated 
the authorized carrying capacity for each land management district of 
the Navajo Reservation.
    (b) Recommended adjustments in carrying capacities shall be referred 
by the Superintendent to District Grazing Committee, Central Grazing 
Committee, and the Navajo Tribal Council for review and recommendations 
prior to presentation to the Area Director and the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs for approval.
    (c) Upon the request of the District Grazing Committee, Central 
Grazing Committee and Navajo Tribal Council to the Superintendent; 
recommendations for future adjustments to the established carrying 
capacities shall be made by Range Technicians based on the best 
information available through annual utilization studies and range 
condition studies analyzed along with numbers of livestock and 
precipitation

[[Page 453]]

data. The recommendations of the Range Technicians shall be submitted to 
the Superintendent, the Area Director and the Commissioner of Indian 
Affairs.
    (d) Carrying capacities shall be stated in terms of sheep units 
yearlong, in the ratio of horses, mules, and burros 1 to 5; cattle 1 to 
4; goats 1 to 1. The latter figure in each case denotes sheep units. 
Sheep, goats, cattle, horses, mules, and burros one year of age or older 
shall be counted against the carrying capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 167.7  Records.

    The District Grazing Committee, the Superintendent, and his 
authorized representatives shall keep accurate records of all grazing 
permits and ownership of all livestock. Master files shall be maintained 
by the Superintendent or his authorized representatives.
    (a) The District Grazing Committee shall be responsibile for and 
assist in organizing the sheep and goat dipping and horse and cattle 
branding program and obtaining the annual live- stock count.
    (b) In order to obtain true records of ownership the permittee shall 
personally appear at the dipping vat or tallying point designated by the 
Grazing Committee with his or her sheep and goats and at branding and 
tallying points for cattle and horses. Should the permittee be unable to 
appear personally he or she shall designate a representative to act for 
and in his or her behalf. The sheep and goats will be dipped and the 
cattle and horses will be branded and recorded in the name of the 
permittee.
    (c) The Superintendent shall prepare and keep current a register 
containing the names of all permittees using the range, the number of 
each class of stock by age classes grazed annually and the periods 
during which grazing shall be permitted in each part thereof. An annual 
stock census will be taken to insure that the carrying capacity is not 
exceeded. All classes of livestock twelve months of age or over will be 
counted against range use and permitted number, except that yearling 
colts will not be counted against permitted numbers on all permits with 
less than six horses. (Cross Reference Sec. 167.9.)


<R05>
Sec. 167.8  Grazing rights.

    (a) The Superintendent shall determine grazing rights of bona fide 
live-stock owners based on recommendations of District Grazing 
Committees. Grazing rights shall be recognized for those permittees 
having ownership records as established in accordance with Sec. 167.7 or 
who have acquired grazing rights by marriage, inheritance, purchase or 
division of permits. Whenever the permitted number of sheep units within 
a district is less than the carrying capacity, new permits to the 
carrying capacity limit may be granted as provided in Sec. 167.9.
    (b) All enrolled members of the Navajo Tribe over 18 years of age 
are eligible to acquire and hold grazing permits. Minors under 18 years 
of age can get possession of grazing permits only through inheritance or 
gift, and in each case Trustees must be appointed by the Tribal Courts 
to manage the permits and livestock of such minors until they become 18 
years of age and can hold grazing permits in their own right.
    (c) No person can hold a grazing permit in more than one district on 
the Navajo Reservation.
    (d) Determination of rights to grazing permits involved in cases of 
divorce, separation, threatened family disruption, and permits of 
deceased permittees shall be the responsibility of the Navajo Court of 
Indian Offenses under existing laws, rules, and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 167.9  Grazing permits.

    (a) All livestock grazed on the Navajo Reservation must be covered 
by an authorized grazing permit issued by the Superintendent based upon 
the recommendations of the District Grazing Committee. All such grazing 
permits will be automatically renewed annually until terminated. 
District Grazing Committees shall act on all grazing permit changes 
resulting from negotiability within their respective Districts. The 
number of livestock that may be grazed under each permit shall be the 
number originally permitted plus or minus any changes as indicated

[[Page 454]]

by Transfer Agreements and Court Judgment Orders.
    (b) Any permittee who has five or more horses on his current permit 
will be required to apply any acquired sheep units in classes of stock 
other than horses. If the purchaser wishes more than his present number 
of horses, he must have his needs evaluated by the District Grazing 
Committee. Yearling colts will be counted against permitted number on 
all permits with six or more horses. Yearling colts will not be counted 
against permitted number on all permits with less than six horses. In 
hardship cases the District Grazing Committee may reissue horses removed 
from grazing permits through negotiability to permit holders who are 
without sufficient horses on their present permits to meet minimum 
needs.
    (c) No permittee shall be authorized to graze more than ten head of 
horses or to accumulate a total of over 350 sheep units.
    (d) Upon recommendation of the District Grazing Committee and with 
the approval of the Superintendent, grazing permits may be transferred 
from one permittee to another in accordance with instructions provided 
by the Advisory Committee of the Navajo Tribal Council, or may be 
inherited; provided that the permitted holdings of any individual 
permittee shall not exceed 350 sheep units or the equivalent thereof. 
Should inheritance or other acquisition of permits increase the holdings 
of any permittee to more than 350 sheep units, said permittee shall 
dispose of all livestock in excess of 350 sheep units not later than 
November 15 following date of inheritance or other acquisition, and that 
portion of his or her permit in excess of 350 sheep units within one 
year from date of inheritance.
    (e) By request of a permittee to sublet all or a part of his or her 
regular grazing permit to a member of his family or to any person who 
would receive such permit by inheritance, such subletting of permits may 
be authorized by the District Grazing Committee and the Superintendent 
or his authorized representative.


<R05>
Sec. 167.10  Special grazing permits.

    The problem of special grazing permits shall be settled by the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs working in cooperation with the Tribal Council, 
or any Committee designated by it, with a view to terminating these 
permits at a suitable date and with the least hardship to the Indians 
concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 167.11  Tenure of grazing permits.

    (a) All active regular grazing permits shall be for one year and 
shall be automatically renewed annually until terminated. Any Navajo 
eligible to hold a grazing permit as defined in Sec. 167.8 may become a 
livestock operator by obtaining an active grazing permit through 
negotiability or inheritance or both.
    (b) In many Districts, and portions of all districts, unused grazing 
permits or portions of grazing permits are beneficial in aiding range 
recovery. Each District Grazing Committee will handle each matter of 
unused grazing permit or portions of grazing permits on individual 
merits. Where ample forage is available operators will be encouraged to 
fill their permits with livestock or dispose of their unused permits 
through negotiability. In those areas where forage is in need of 
rehabilitation permittees will not be encouraged to stock to their 
permitted numbers until the range has sufficiently recovered to justify 
the grazing of additional livestock.


<R05>
Sec. 167.12  Grazing fees.

    Grazing fees shall not be charged at this time.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Grazing Committees were organized in May 1953. These committees 
have not had ample time to fully acquaint themselves or the stockmen in 
their respective districts with all of the various items of range 
administration and range management. Also the drought of several years 
has not broken. The Navajo Tribe therefore requests that the matter of 
establishing regulations regarding the adoption of grazing fees be 
deferred until such a time as a full understanding of the advantages of 
fees can be had by the majority of the stockmen in all Districts. The 
assessment of grazing fees will not aid materially in obtaining proper 
range use. At this time it is more important that other sections of 
these grazing regulations be adopted and enforced. Resolution of Navajo 
Tribal Council No. CJ-22-54 of June 9, 1954.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 455]]


<R05>
Sec. 167.13  Trespass.

    The owner of any livestock grazing in trespass in Navajo Tribal 
ranges shall be subject to action by the Navajo Court of Indian Offenses 
as provided in part 11 of this chapter, however, upon recommendations of 
the District Grazing Committee, first offenses may be referred to the 
Central Grazing Committee and the Superintendent or his authorized 
representative for proper settlement out of court. The following acts 
are considered as trespass:
    (a) Any person who sells an entire permit must dispose of all his 
livestock or be in trespass. Any person selling a portion of his permit 
must not run more stock than covered by his remaining permit, or be 
subject to immediate trespass.
    (b) All persons running livestock in excess of their permitted 
number must by April 25, 1959, either obtain permits to cover their 
total livestock numbers or reduce to their permitted number, or be in 
trespass. Additional time may be granted in unusual individual cases as 
determined and approved by the District Grazing Committee, General 
Grazing Committee, and the Superintendent or his authorized 
representative.
    (c) Failure to comply with the provisions in Sec. 167.9, shall be 
considered as trespass.
    (d) Any person who willfully allows his livestock to drift from one 
district to another shall be subject to trespass action. The grazing of 
livestock in customary use areas extending over District Boundary lines, 
when such customary use areas are defined and agreed upon by the 
District Grazing Committees involved, shall not be considered as willful 
trespass.
    (e) The owner of any livestock who violates the customary or 
established use units of other permittees shall be subject to trespass 
action.

<R05>
Sec. 167.14  Movement of livestock.

    Annually, prior to the normal lamb buying season, the Central 
Grazing Committee after consultation with District Grazing Committees 
shall issue regulations covering the buying period and the procedures 
and methods to be used in moving livestock to market. All movements of 
livestock other than trucking from buying areas to loading or shipping 
points must be authorized by Trailing Permits issued by the District 
Grazing Committees on the approved forms. Failure to comply with this 
section and with annual lamb buying regulations will be considered as 
trespass.


<R05>
Sec. 167.15  Control of livestock disease and introduction of livestock.

    (a) The District Grazing Committees with the approval of the 
Superintendent shall require livestock to be dipped, vaccinated, 
inspected and be restricted in movement when necessary to prevent the 
introduction and spread of contagious or infectious disease in the 
economic interest of the Navajo stock owners. Upon the recommendation of 
the District Grazing Committee livestock shall be dipped annually when 
such dipping is necessary to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. 
These annual dippings shall be completed on or before September 1st each 
year. Livestock, however, may be dipped at other times when necessary. 
The Superintendent or his authorized representative and the District 
Grazing Committee may also require the rounding up of cattle, horses, 
mules, etc., in each District for the purpose of inspection for disease, 
vaccinating, branding and other related operations.
    (b) No livestock shall be brought onto the Reservation without a 
permit issued by the Superintendent or his authorized representative 
following inspection, in order to safeguard Indian livestock from 
infections and contagious disease and to insure the introduction of good 
quality sires and breeding stock.
    (c) Any unusual disease conditions beyond the control measures 
provided herein shall be immediately reported by the District Grazing 
Committee to the Chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council and the 
Superintendent who

[[Page 456]]

shall attempt to obtain specialists and provide emergency funds to 
control and suppress the disease.


<R05>
Sec. 167.16  Fences.

    Favorable recommendation from the District Grazing Committee and a 
written authorization from the Superintendent or his authorized 
representative must be secured before any fences may be constructed in 
non-agricultural areas. The District Grazing Committee shall recommend 
to the Superintendent the removal of unauthorized existing fences, or 
fences enclosing demonstration areas no longer used as such, if it is 
determined that such fences interfere with proper range management or an 
equitable distribution of range privileges. All enclosures fenced for 
the purpose of protecting agricultural land shall be kept to a size 
commensurate with the needs for protection of agricultural land and must 
be enclosed by legal four strand barbed wire fence or the equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 167.17  Construction near permanent livestock water developments.

    (a) The District Grazing Committee shall regulate the construction 
of all dwellings, corrals and other structures within one-half mile of 
Government or Navajo Tribal developed permanent livestock waters such as 
springs, wells, and charcos or deep reservoirs.
    (b) A written authorization from the District Grazing Committee must 
be secured before any dwellings, corrals, or other structures may be 
constructed within one-half mile of Government or Navajo Tribal 
developed springs, wells and charcos or deep reservoirs.
    (c) No sewage disposal system shall be authorized to be built which 
will drain into springs or stream channels in such a manner that it 
would cause contamination of waters being used for livestock or human 
consumption.

only to lands partitioned to the Hopi Tribe within the former Joint Use 
Area.


<R05>
Sec. 168.4  Establishment of range units.

    The Area Director will use Soil and Range Inventory data to 
establish range units on the Hopi Partitioned Area to provide for a 
surface land management program to restore the land to its full grazing 
potential and maintain that potential to the maximum extent feasible. 
The establishment of range units on Hopi Partitioned Lands is subject to 
the concurrence of the Hopi Tribe in accordance with Sec. 168.17 of 
these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 168.5  Grazing capacity.

    (a) The Area Director shall prescribe the maximum number of each 
kind of livestock which may be grazed on land under his jurisdiction 
without inducing damage to vegetation or related resources on each range 
unit and the season or seasons of use to achieve the objectives of the 
land recovery program required by the Settlement Act.
    (b) The Area Director shall review the stocking rate upon which the

under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
    (a) Grazing permits to Hopi tribal members on their partitioned 
lands. The Area Director shall assign grazing privileges to the Hopi 
Tribe for lands within Hopi Partitioned Lands. The tribal government 
will then allocate use to their tribal members for permit periods not to 
exceed five years. Grazing use by Hopi tribal enterprises may be 
authorized. The Area Director will issue permits based on the 
determination of the Hopi tribal government.
    (b) Interim Grazing Permit for persons awaiting relocation. Navajo 
Tribal members who have maintained both a permanent residence on Hopi 
Partitioned lands; a livestock inventory since enumeration; and meet all 
the criteria listed in Sec. 168.1(o), shall be eligible for an interim 
grazing allocation on Hopi Partitioned Lands under the following terms 
and conditions:
    (1) The Area Director shall first verify that an applicant meets the 
criteria of the definition in Sec. 168.1(o) and will issue all permits.
    (2) The permitted number shall not exceed either (i) 10 SUYL (See 
Sec. 168.1(1)) for each eligible family member, or (ii) the grazing 
applicant's livestock inventory reduced by voluntary sales as adjusted 
by reproduction, in accordance with procedures developed by the Project 
Officer based upon the study by Stubblefield and Camfield, 1975 page 5. 
The determination of the person to whom permits will be issued and the 
number of livestock to be permitted will be based on information 
provided by the permit applicant and an assessment of the number of 
dependents residing in the immediate household.
    (3) The permit shall authorize grazing for a specific number and 
kind of animal(s) in a specified range unit. Interim grazing permits 
will not be issued in excess of one-half the authorized carrying 
capacity of the Hopi Partition area.
    (4) Subject to the provisions of Sec. 168.9(b), permits shall expire 
when the person awaiting relocation is relocated pursuant to the 
Settlement Act. No interim permit will be issued for a term greater than 
one year. Permits may be reissued upon application and redetermination 
of eligibility. All interim permits will expire at the end of the period 
provided for completion of relocation, Pub. L. 99-190. When a Navajo 
permit holder discontinues grazing livestock or reduces the number being 
grazed whether by reason of his relocating or for any other reason, his 
grazing permit will be cancelled or reduced and no permit will be issued 
in lieu thereof. The total number of authorized animal units grazed by 
the

[[Page 459]]

Navajo permit holders awaiting relocation will reduced by the number of 
animal units authorized under the cancelled or reduced permit.

    (b) The Hopi Tribe has established an annual grazing fee to be 
assessed all range users on Hopi Partitioned Lands. The annual Hopi 
grazing fee shall be paid in full in advance of the annual effective 
date of the permit, prior to the issuance of a grazing permit. All 
interim permits will expire at the end of the period provided for 
completion of relocation, Pub. L. 99-190. Failure of the permittee to 
make payment in full in advance will be cause to deny issuance of the 
grazing permit.

Sec. 169.2  Purpose and scope of regulations.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.2 of this chapter, the 
regulations in this part 169 prescribe the procedures, terms and

    (c) The Secretary may issue permission to survey with respect to, 
and he may grant rights-of-way over and across individually owned lands 
without the consent of the individual Indian owners when
    (1) The individual owner of the land or of an interest therein is a 
minor or a person non compos mentis, and the Secretary finds that such 
grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner, which 
cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages;
    (2) The land is owned by more than one person, and the owners or 
owner of a majority of the interests therein consent to the grant;
    (3) The whereabouts of the owner of the land or an interest therein 
are unknown, and the owners or owner of any interests therein whose 
whereabouts

[[Page 464]]

are known, or a majority thereof, consent to the grant;
    (4) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or an 
interest therein have not been determined, and the Secretary finds that 
the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any owner 
thereof;
    (5) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the 
Secretary finds it would be impracticable to obtain their consent, and 
also finds that the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land

Sec. 169.4  Permission to survey.

    Anyone desiring to obtain permission to survey for a right-of-way 
across individually owned, tribal or Government owned land must file a 
written application therefor with the Secretary. The application shall 
adequately describe the proposed project, including the purpose and 
general location, and it shall be accompanied by the written consents 
required by Sec. 169.3, by satisfactory evidence of the good faith and 
financial responsibility of the applicant, and by a check or money order 
of sufficient amount to cover twice the estimated damages which may be 
sustained as a result of the survey. With the approval of the Secretary, 
a surety bond may be substituted in lieu of a check or money order 
accompanying an application, provided the company issuing the surety 
bond is licensed to do business in the State where the land to be 
surveyed is located. The application shall contain an agreement to 
indemnify the United States, the owners of the land, and occupants of 
the land, against liability for loss of life, personal injury and 
property damage occurring because of survey activities and caused by the 
applicant, his employees, contractors and their employees, or 
subcontractors and their employees. When the applicant is an agency or 
instrumentality of the Federal or a State Government and is prohibited 
by law from depositing estimated damages in advance or agreeing to 
indemnification, the requirement for such a deposit and indemnification 
may be waived providing the applicant agrees in writing to pay damages 
promptly when they are sustained. An application filed by a corporation 
must be accompanied by a copy of its charter or articles of 
incorporation duly certified by the proper State official of the State 
where the corporation was organized, and a certified copy of the 
resolution or bylaws of the corporation authorizing the filing of the 
application. When the land covered by the application is located in a 
State other than that in which the application was incorporated, it must 
also submit a certificate of the proper State official that the 
applicant is authorized to do business in the State where the land is 
located. An application filed by an unincorporated partnership or 
association must be accompanied by a certified copy of the articles of 
partnership or association, or if there be none, this fact must be 
stated over the signature of each member of the partnership or 
association. If the applicant has previously filed with the Secretary an 
application accompanied by the evidence required in this section, a 
reference to the date and place of such filing, accompanied by proof of 
current financial responsibility and good faith, will be sufficient. 
Upon receipt of an application made in compliance with the regulations 
of this part 169, the Secretary may grant the applicant written 
permission to survey.


<R05>
Sec. 169.5  Application for right-of-way.

    Written application identifying the specific use requested shall be 
filed in duplicate with the Secretary. The application shall cite the 
statute or statutes under which it is filed and the width and length of 
the desired right-of-way, and shall be accompanied by satisfactory 
evidence of the good faith and financial responsibility of the 
applicant. An application filed by a corporation must be accompanied by 
a copy of its charter or articles of incorporation duly certified by the 
proper State official of the State where the corporation was organized, 
and a certified copy of the resolution or bylaws of the corporation 
authorizing the filing of the application. When the land covered by the 
application is located in a State other than that in which the applicant 
was incorporated, it must

[[Page 465]]

also submit a certificate of the proper State official that the 
applicant is authorized to do business in the State where the land is 
located. An application filed by an unincorporated partnership or 
association must be accompanied be a certified copy of the articles of 
partnership or association, or if there be none, this fact must be 
stated over the signature of each member of the partnership or 
association. If the applicant has previously filed with the Secretary an 
application accompanied by the evidence required by this section, a 
reference to the date and place of such filing will be sufficient. 
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the application shall be 
accompanied by a duly executed stipulation, in duplicate, expressly 
agreeing to the following:
    (a) To construct and maintain the right-of-way in a workmanlike 
manner.
    (b) To pay promptly all damages and compensation, in addition to the 
deposit made pursuant to Sec. 169.4, determined by the Secretary to be 
due the landowners and authorized users and occupants of the land on 
account of the survey, granting, construction and maintenance of the 
right-of-way.
    (c) To indemnify the landowners and authorized users and occupants 
against any liability for loss of life, personal injury and property 
damage arising from the construction, maintenance, occupancy or use of 
the lands by the applicant, his employees, contractors and their 
employees, or subcontractors and their employees.
    (d) To restore the lands as nearly as may be possible to their 
original condition upon the completion of construction to the extent 
compatible with the purpose for which the right-of-way was granted.
    (e) To clear and keep clear the lands within the right-of-way to the 
extent compatible with the purpose of the right-of-way; and to dispose 
of all vegetative and other material cut, uprooted, or otherwise 
accumulated during the construction and maintenance of the project.
    (f) To take soil and resource conservation and protection measures, 
including weed control, on the land covered by the right-of-way.
    (g) To do everything reasonably within its power to prevent and 
suppress fires on or near the lands to be occupied under the right-of-
way.
    (h) To build and repair such roads, fences, and trails as may be 
destroyed or injured by construction work and to build and maintain 
necessary and suitable crossings for all roads and trails that intersect 
the works constructed, maintained, or operated under the right-of-way.
    (i) That upon revocation or termination of the right-of-way, the 
applicant shall, so far as is reasonably possible, restore the land to 
its original condition.
    (j) To at all times keep the Secretary informed of its address, and 
in case of corporations, of the address of its principal place of 
business and of the names and addresses of its principal officers.
    (k) That the applicant will not interfere with the use of the lands 
by or under the authority of the landowners for any purpose not 
inconsistent with the primary purpose for which the right-of-way is 
granted.

When the applicant is the U.S. Government or a State Government or an 
instrumentality thereof and is prohibited by law from executing any of 
the above stipulations, the Secretary may waive the requirement that the 
applicant agree to any stipulations so prohibited.

<R05>
Sec. 169.6  Maps.

    (a) Each application for a right-of-way shall be accompanied by maps 
of definite location consisting of an original on tracing linen or other 
permanent and reproducible material and two reproductions thereof. The 
field notes shall accompany the application, as provided in Sec. 169.7. 
The width of the right-of-way shall be clearly shown on the maps.
    (b) A separate map shall be filed for each section of 20 miles of 
right-of-way, but the map of the last section may include any excess of 
10 miles or less.
    (c) The scale of maps showing the line of route normally should be 
2,000 feet to an inch. The maps may, however, be drawn to a larger scale 
when

[[Page 466]]

necessary and when an increase in scale cannot be avoided through the 
use of separate field notes, but the scale must not be increased to such 
extent as to make the maps too cumbersome for convenient handling and 
filing.
    (d) The maps shall show the allotment number of each tract of 
allotted land, and shall clearly designate each tract of tribal land 
affected, together with the sections, townships, and ranges in which the 
lands crossed by the right-of-way are situated.


<R05>
Sec. 169.7  Field notes.

    Field notes of the survey shall appear along the line indicating the 
right-of-way on the maps, unless the maps would be too crowded thereby 
to be easily legible, in which event the field notes may be filed 
separately on tracing linen in such form that they may be folded readily 
for filing. Where field notes are placed on separate tracing linen, it 
will be necessary to place on the maps only a sufficient number of 
station numbers so as to make it convenient to follow the field notes. 
The field notes shall be typewritten. Whether endorsed on the maps or 
filed separately, the field notes shall be sufficiently complete so as 
to permit the line indicating the right-of-way to be readily retraced on 
the ground from the notes. They shall show whether the line was run on 
true or magnetic bearings, and, in the latter case, the variation of the 
needle and date of determination must be stated. One or more bearings 
(or angular connections with public survey lines) must be given. The 10-
mile sections must be indicated and numbered on all lines of road 
submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 169.8  Public survey.

    (a) The terminal of the line of route shall be fixed by reference of 
course and distance to the nearest existing corner of the public survey. 
The maps, as well as the engineer's affidavit and the certificate, shall 
show these connections.
    (b) When either terminal of the line of route is upon unsurveyed 
land, it must be connected by traverse with an established corner of the 
public survey if not more than 6 miles distant from it, and the single 
bearing and distance from the terminal point to the corner computed and 
noted on the maps, in the engineer's affidavit, and in the certificate. 
The notes and all data for the computation of the traverse must be 
given.


<R05>
Sec. 169.9  Connection with natural objects.

    When the distance to an established corner of the public survey is 
more than 6 miles, this connection will be made with a natural object or 
a permanent monument which can be readily found and recognized, and 
which will fix and perpetuate the position of the terminal point. The 
maps must show the position of such mark, and course and distance to the 
terminus. There must be given an accurate description of the mark and 
full data concerning the traverse, and the engineer's affidavit and the 
certificate on the maps must state the connections.


<R05>
Sec. 169.10  Township and section lines.

    Whenever the line of survey crosses a township or section line of 
the public survey, the distance to the nearest existing corner shall be 
noted. The maps shall show these distances and the station numbers at 
the points of intersections. The field notes shall show these distances 
and the station numbers.


<R05>
Sec. 169.11  Affidavit and certificate.

    (a) There shall be subscribed on the maps of definite location an 
affidavit executed by the engineer who made the survey and a certificate 
executed by the applicant, both certifying to the accuracy of the survey 
and maps and both designating by termini and length in miles and 
decimals, the line of route for which the right-of-way application is 
made.
    (b) Maps covering roads built by the Bureau of Indian Affairs which 
are to be transferred to a county or State government shall contain an 
affidavit as to the accuracy of the survey, executed by the Bureau 
highway engineer in charge of road construction, and a certificate by 
the State or county engineer or other authorized State or county officer 
accepting the right-of-way and stating that he is satisfied as to the 
accuracy of the survey and maps.

<R05>
Sec. 169.12  Consideration for right-of-way grants.

    Except when waived in writing by the landowners or their 
representatives as defined in Sec. 169.3 and approved by the Secretary, 
the consideration for any right-of-way granted or renewed under this 
part 169 shall be not less than but not limited to the fair market value 
of the rights granted, plus severance damages, if any, to the remaining 
estate. The Secretary shall obtain and advise the landowners of the 
appraisal information to assist them (the landowner or landowners) in 
negotiations for a right-of-way or renewal.

<R05>
Sec. 169.13  Other damages.

    In addition to the consideration for a grant of right-of-way 
provided for by the provisions of Sec. 169.12, the applicant for a 
right-of-way will be required to pay all damages incident to the survey 
of the right-of-way or incident to the construction or maintenance of 
the facility for which the right-of-way is granted.


<R05>
Sec. 169.14  Deposit and disbursement of consideration and damages.

    At the time of filing an application for right-of-way, the applicant 
must deposit with the Secretary the total estimated consideration and 
damages, which shall include consideration for the right-of-way, 
severance damages, damages caused during the survey, and estimated 
damages to result from construction less any deposit previously made 
under Sec. 169.4. In no case shall the amount deposited as consideration 
for the right-of-way over any parcel be less than the amount specified 
in the consent covering that parcel. If in reviewing the application, 
the Secretary determines that the amounts deposited are inadequate to 
compensate the owners, the applicant shall increase the deposit to an 
amount determined by the Secretary to be adequate. The amounts so 
deposited shall be held in a ``special deposit'' account for 
distribution to or for the account of the landowners and authorized 
users and occupants of the land. Amounts deposited to cover damages 
resulting from survey and construction may be disbursed after the 
damages have been sustained. Amounts deposited to cover consideration 
for the right-of-way and severance damages shall be disbursed upon the 
granting of the right-of-way. Any part of the deposit which is not 
required for disbursement as aforesaid shall be refunded to the 
applicant promptly following receipt of the affidavit of completion of 
construction filed pursuant to Sec. 169.16.


<R05>
Sec. 169.15  Action on application.

    Upon satisfactory compliance with the regulations in this part 169, 
the Secretary is authorized to grant the right-of-way by issuance of a 
conveyance instrument in the form approved by the Secretary. Such 
instrument shall incorporate all conditions or restrictions set out in 
the consents obtained pursuant to Sec. 169.3. A copy of such instrument 
shall be promptly delivered to the applicant and thereafter the 
applicant may proceed with the construction work. Maps of definite 
location may be attached to and incorporated into the conveyance 
document by reference. In the discretion of the Secretary, one 
conveyance document may be issued covering all of the tracts of land 
traversed by the right-of-way, or separate conveyances may be made 
covering one or several tracts included in the application. A duplicate 
original copy of the conveyance instrument, permanent and reproducible 
maps, a copy of the application and stipulations, together with any 
other pertinent documents shall be transmitted by the Secretary to the 
office of record for land documents affecting the land covered by the 
right-of-way, where they will be recorded and filed.


<R05>
Sec. 169.16  Affidavit of completion.

    Upon the completion of the construction of any right-of-way, the 
applicant shall promptly file with the Secretary an affidavit of 
completion, in duplicate, executed by the engineer and certified by the 
applicant. The Secretary shall transmit one copy of the affidavit to the 
office of record mentioned in Sec. 169.15. Failure to file an affidavit 
in accordance with this section shall subject the right-of-way to 
cancellation in accordance with Sec. 169.20.

[[Page 468]]


<R05>
Sec. 169.17  Change of location.

    If any change from the location described in the conveyance 
instrument is found to be necessary on account of engineering 
difficulties or otherwise, amended maps and field notes of the new 
location shall be filed, and a right-of-way for such new route or 
location shall be subject to consent, approval, the ascertainment of 
damages, and the payment thereof, in all respects as in the case of the 
original location. Before a revised conveyance instrument is issued, the 
applicant shall execute such instruments deemed necessary by the 
Secretary extinguishing the right-of-way at the original location. Such 
instruments shall be transmitted by the Secretary to the office of 
record mentioned in Sec. 169.15 for recording and filing.


<R05>
Sec. 169.18  Tenure of approved right-of-way grants.

    All rights-of-way granted under the regulations in this part 169 
shall be in the nature of easements for the periods stated in the 
conveyance instrument. Except as otherwise determined by the Secretary 
and stated in the conveyance instrument, rights-of-way granted under the 
Act of February 5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323-328), for railroads, 
telephone lines, telegraph lines, public roads and highways, access 
roads to homesite properties, public sanitary and storm sewer lines 
including sewage disposal and treatment plants, water control and use 
projects (including but not limited to dams, reservoirs, flowage 
easements, ditches, and canals), oil, gas, and public utility water 
pipelines (including pumping stations and appurtenant facilities), 
electric power projects, generating plants, switchyards, electric 
transmission and distribution lines (including poles, towers, and 
appurtenant facilities), and for service roads and trails essential to 
any of the aforestated use purposes, may be without limitation as to 
term of years; whereas, rights-of-way for all other purposes shall be 
for a period of not to exceed 50 years, as determined by the Secretary 
and stated in the conveyance instrument.

<R05>
Sec. 169.19  Renewal of right-of-way grants.

    On or before the expiration date of any right-of-way heretofore or 
hereafter granted for a limited term of years, an application may be 
submitted for a renewal of the grant. If the renewal involves no change 
in the location or status of the original right-of-way grant, the 
applicant may file with his application a certificate under oath setting 
out this fact, and the Secretary, with the consent required by 
Sec. 169.3, may thereupon extend the grant for a like term of years, 
upon the payment of consideration as set forth in Sec. 169.12. If any 
change in the size, type, or location of the right-of-way is involved, 
the application for renewal shall be treated and handled as in the case 
of an original application for a right-of-way.


<R05>
Sec. 169.20  Termination of right-of-way grants.

    All rights-of-way granted under the regulations in this part may be 
terminated in whole or in part upon 30 days written notice from the 
Secretary mailed to the grantee at its latest address furnished in 
accordance with Sec. 169.5(j) for any of the following causes:
    (a) Failure to comply with any term or condition of the grant or the 
applicable regulations;
    (b) A nonuse of the right-of-way for a consecutive 2-year period for 
the purpose for which it was granted;
    (c) An abandonment of the right-of-way.

If within the 30-day notice period the grantee fails to correct the 
basis for termination, the Secretary shall issue an appropriate 
instrument terminating the right-of-way. Such instrument shall be 
transmitted by the Secretary to the office of record mentioned in 
Sec. 169.15 for recording and filing.

<R05>
Sec. 169.21  Condemnation actions involving individually owned lands.

    The facts relating to any condemnation action to obtain a right-of-
way over individually owned lands shall be reported immediately by 
officials of

[[Page 469]]

the Bureau of Indian Affairs having knowledge of such facts to 
appropriate officials of the Interior Department so that action may be 
taken to safeguard the interests of the Indians.


<R05>
Sec. 169.22  Service lines.

    (a) An agreement shall be executed by and between the landowner or a 
legally authorized occupant or user of individually owned land and the 
applicant before any work by the applicant may be undertaken to 
construct a service line across such land. Such a service line shall be 
limited in the case of power lines to a voltage of 14.5 kv. or less 
except lines to serve irrigation pumps and commercial and industrial 
uses which shall be limited to a voltage not to exceed 34.5 kv. A 
service line shall be for the sole purpose of supplying the individual 
owner or authorized occupant or user of land, including schools and 
churches, with telephone, water, electric power, gas, and other 
utilities for use by such owner, occupant, or user of the land on the 
premises.
    (b) A similar agreement to that required in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be executed by the tribe or legally authorized occupant or 
user of tribal land and the applicant before any work by the applicant 
may be undertaken for the construction of a service line across tribal 
land. A service line shall be for the sole purpose of supplying an 
occupant or user of tribal land with any of the utilities specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. No agreement under this paragraph shall 
be valid unless its execution shall have been duly authorized in advance 
of construction by the governing body of the Indian tribe whose land is 
affected, unless the contract under which the occupant or user of the 
land obtained his rights specifically authorizes such occupant or user 
to enter into service agreements for utilities without further tribal 
consent.
    (c) In order to encourage the use of telephone, water, electric 
power, gas and other utilities and to facilitate the extension of these 
modern conveniences to sparsely settled Indian areas without undue costs 
the agreement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall only be 
required to include or have appended thereto, a plat or diagram showing 
with particularity the location, size, and extent of the line. When the 
plat or diagram is placed on a separate sheet it shall bear the 
signature of the parties. In case of tribal land, the agreement shall be 
accompanied by a certified copy of the tribal authorization when 
required.
    (d) An executed copy of the agreement, together with a plat or 
diagram, and in the case of tribal land, an authenticated copy of the 
tribal authorization, when required, shall be filed with the Secretary 
within 30 days after the date of its execution. Failure to meet this 
requirement may result in the removal of improvements placed on the land 
at the expense of the party responsible for the placing of such 
improvements and subject such party to the payment of damages caused by 
his unauthorized act.

June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 859; 25 U.S.C. 312--318); the Act of March 3, 
1875 (18 Stat. 482; 43 U.S.C. 934); and the Act of March 3, 1909 (35 
Stat. 781), as amended by the Act of May 6, 1910 (36 Stat. 349; 25 
U.S.C. 320), authorize grants of rights-of-way across tribal, 
individually owned and Government-owned land, except in the State of 
Oklahoma, for railroads, station buildings, depots, machine shops, side 
tracks, turnouts, and water stations; for reservoirs, material or 
ballast pits needed to the construction, repair, and maintenance of 
railroads; and for the planting and growing of trees to protect railroad 
lines. Rights-of-way granted under the above acts shall be subject to 
the provisions of this section as well as other pertinent sections of 
this part 169. Except when otherwise determined by the Secretary, 
rights-of-way for the above purposes granted under the Act of February 
5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323-328), shall also be subject to the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) Rights-of-way for railroads shall not exceed 50 feet in width on 
each side of the centerline of the road, except where there are heavy 
cuts and fills,

[[Page 470]]

when they shall not exceed 100 feet in width on each side of the road. 
The right-of-way may include grounds adjacent to the line for station 
buildings, depots, machine shops, side tracks, turnouts, and water 
stations, not to exceed 200 feet in width by a length of 3,000 feet, 
with no more than one station to be located within any one continuous 
length of 10 miles of road.
    (c) Short spurs and branch lines may be shown on the map of the main 
line, separately described by termini and length. Longer spurs and 
branch lines shall be shown on separate maps. Grounds desired for 
station purposes may be indicated on the map of definite location but 
separate plats must be filed for such grounds. The maps shall show any 
other line crossed, or with which connection is made. The station number 
shall be shown on the survey thereof at the point of intersection. All 
intersecting roads must be represented in ink of a different color from 
that used for the line for which application is made.
    (d) Plats of railroad station grounds shall be drawn on a scale of 
400 feet to an inch, and must be filed separately from the line of 
route. Such plats shall show enough of the line of route to indicate the 
position of the tract with reference thereto. Each station ground tract 
must be located with respect to the public survey as provided in 
Sec. 169.8 and all buildings or other structures shall be platted on a 
scale sufficiently large to show clearly their dimensions and relative 
positions.
    (e) If any proposed railroad is parallel to, and within 10 miles of, 
a railroad already built or in course of construction, it must be shown 
wherein the public interest will be promoted by the proposed road. Where 
the Interstate Commerce Commission has passed on this point, a certified 
copy of its findings must be filed with the application.
    (f) The applicant must certify that the road is to be operated as a 
common carrier of passengers and freight.
    (g) The applicant shall execute and file, in duplicate, a 
stipulation obligating the company to use all precautions possible to 
prevent forest fires and to suppress such fires when they occur, to 
construct and maintain passenger and freight stations for each 
Government townsite, and to permit the crossing, in a manner 
satisfactory to the Government officials in charge, of the right-of-way 
by canals, ditches, and other projects.
    (h) A railroad company may apply for sufficient land for ballast or 
material pits, reservoirs, or tree planting to aid in the construction 
or maintenance of the road. The authority to use any land for such 
purposes shall terminate upon abandonment or upon failure to use the 
land for such purposes for a continuous period of 2 years.


<R05>
Sec. 169.24  Railroads in Oklahoma.

    (a) The Act of February 28, 1902 (32 Stat. 43), authorizes right-of-
way grants across tribal and individually owned land in Oklahoma. 
Rights-of-way granted under that act shall be subject to the provisions 
of this section as well as other pertinent sections of this part 169. 
Except when otherwise determined by the Secretary, railroad rights-of-
way in Oklahoma granted under the Act of February 5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 
25 U.S.C. 323-328), shall also be subject to the provisions of this 
section.
    (b) One copy on tracing linen of the map of definite location 
showing the line of route and all lands included within the right-of-way 
must be filed with the Secretary. When tribal lands are involved, a copy 
of the map must also be filed with the tribal council.
    (c) Before any railroad may be constructed or any lands taken or 
condemned for any of the purposes set forth in section 13 of the Act of 
February 28, 1902 (32 Stat. 47), full damages shall be paid to the 
Indian owners.
    (d) After the maps have been filed, the matter of damages shall be 
negotiated by the applicant directly with the Indian owners. If an 
amicable settlement cannot be reached, the amount to be paid as 
compensation and damages shall be fixed and determined as provided in 
the statute. If court proceedings are instituted, the facts shall be

Sec. 169.25  Oil and gas pipelines.

    (a) The Act of March 11, 1904 (33 Stat. 65), as amended by the Act 
of March 2,

[[Page 471]]

1917 (39 Stat. 973; 25 U.S.C. 321), authorizes right-of-way grants for 
oil and gas pipelines across tribal, individually owned and Government-
owned land. Rights-of-way granted under that act shall be subject to the 
provisions of this section as well as other pertinent sections of this 
part 169. Except when otherwise determined by the Secretary, rights-of-
way granted for such purposes under the Act of February 5, 1948 (62 
Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323-328) shall also be subject to the provisions of 
this section.
    (b) Rights-of-way, granted under aforesaid Act of March 11, 1904, as 
amended, for oil and gas pipelines, pumping stations or tank sites shall 
not extend beyond a term of 20 years and may be extended for another 
period of not to exceed 20 years following the procedures set out in 
Sec. 169.19 of this part.
    (c) All oil or gas pipelines, including connecting lines, shall be 
buried a sufficient depth below the surface of the land so as not to 
interfere with cultivation. Whenever the line is laid under a road or 
highway, the right-of-way for which has been granted under an approved 
application pursuant to an act of Congress, its construction shall be in 
compliance with the applicable Federal and State laws; during the period 
of construction, at least one-half the width of the road shall be kept 
open to travel; and, upon completion, the road or highway shall be 
restored to its original condition and all excavations shall be 
refilled. Whenever the line crosses a ravine, canyon, or waterway, it 
shall be laid below the bed thereof or upon such superstructure as will 
not interfere with the use of the surface.
    (d) The size of the proposed pipeline must be shown in the 
application, on the maps, and in the engineer's affidavit and 
applicant's certificate. The application and maps shall specify whether 
the pipe is welded, screw-joint, dresser, or other type of coupling. 
Should the grantee of an approved right-of-way desire at any time to lay 
additional line or lines of pipe in the same trench, or to replace the 
original line with larger or smaller pipe, written permission must first 
be obtained from the Secretary and all damages to be sustained by the 
owners must be paid in advance in the amount fixed and determined by the 
Secretary.
    (e) Applicants for oil or gas pipeline rights-of-way may apply for 
additional land for pumping stations or tank sites. The maps shall show 
clearly the location of all structures and the location of all lines 
connecting with the main line. Applicants for lands for pumping stations 
or tank sites shall execute and file a stipulation agreeing as follows:
    (1) Upon abandonment of the right-of-way to level all dikes, fire-
guards, and excavations and to remove all concrete masonry foundations, 
bases, and structural works and to restore the land as nearly as may be 
possible to its original condition.
    (2) That a grant for pumping station or tank site purposes shall be 
subservient to the owner's right to remove or authorize the removal of 
oil, gas, or other mineral deposits; and that the structures for pumping 
station or tank site will be removed or relocated if necessary to avoid 
interference with the exploration for or recovery of oil, gas, or other 
minerals.
    (f) Purely lateral lines connecting with oil or gas wells on 
restricted lands may be constructed upon filing with the Secretary a 
copy of the written consent of the Indian owners and a blueprint copy of 
a map showing the location of the lateral. Such lateral lines may be of 
any diameter or length, but must be limited to those used solely for the 
transportation of oil or gas from a single tract of tribal or 
individually owned land to another lateral or to a branch of the main 
line.
    (g) The applicant, by accepting a pipeline right-of-way, thereby 
agrees that the books and records of the applicant shall be open to 
inspection by the Secretary at all reasonable times, in order to obtain 
information pertaining in any way to oil or gas produced from tribal or 
individually owned lands or other lands under the jurisdiction of the 
Secretary.

telegraph lines and offices, for poles and lines for communication 
purposes, and for radio, television, and other forms of communication 
transmitting, relay, and receiving structures and facilities. Rights-of-
way granted under these acts shall be subject to the provisions of this 
section as well as other pertinent sections of this part 169. Except 
when otherwise determined by the Secretary, rights-of-way granted for 
such purposes under the Act of February 5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 
323--328), shall also be subject to the provisions of this section.
    (b) A right-of-way granted under the said Act of March 4, 1911, as 
amended, shall be limited to a term not exceeding 50 years from the date 
of the issuance of such grant.
    (c) No right-of-way shall be granted for a width in excess of 50 
feet on each side of the centerline, unless special requirements are 
clearly set forth in the application which fully justify a width in 
excess of 50 feet on each side of the centerline.
    (d) Applicants engaged in the general telephone and telegraph 
business may apply for additional land for office sites. The maps 
showing the location of proposed office sites shall be filed separately 
from those showing the line of route, and shall be drawn to a scale of

<R05>
Sec. 169.27  Power projects.

    (a) The Act of March 4, 1911 (36 Stat. 1253), as amended by the Act 
of May 27, 1952 (66 Stat. 95; 43 U.S.C. 961), authorizes right-of-way 
grants across tribal, individually owned and Government-owned land for 
electrical poles and lines for the transmission and distribution of 
electrical power. Rights-of-way granted under that act shall be subject 
to the provisions of this section as well as other pertinent sections of 
this part 169. Except when otherwise determined by the Secretary, 
rights-of-way granted for such purposes under the Act of February 5, 
1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323--328) shall also be subject to the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) All applications, other than those made by power-marketing 
agencies of the Department of the Interior, for authority to survey, 
locate, or commence construction work on any project for the generation 
of electric power, or the transmission or distribution of electrical 
power of 66 kV or higher involving Government-owned lands shall be 
referred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for 
Water and Power Resources or such other agency as may be designated for 
the area involved, for consideration of the relationship of the proposed 
project to the power development program of the United States. Where the 
proposed project will not conflict with the program of the United 
States, the Secretary, upon notification to the effect, may then proceed 
to act upon the application. In the case of necessary changes respecting 
the proposed location, construction, or utilization of the project in 
order to eliminate conflicts with the power development program of the 
United States, the Secretary shall obtain from the applicant written 
consent to or compliance with such requirements before taking further 
action on the application.
    (c) A right-of-way granted under the said Act of March 4, 1911, as 
amended, shall be limited to a term not exceeding 50 years from the date 
of the issuance of such grant.

[[Page 473]]

    (d) Rights-of-way for power lines shall be limited to those widths 
which can be justified and in no event shall exceed a width of 200 feet 
on each side of the centerline.
    (e) The applicant shall make provision, or bear the reasonable cost 
(as may be determined by the Secretary) of making provision, for 
avoiding inductive interference between any project transmission line or 
other project works constructed, operated, or maintained by it on the 
right-of-way authorized under the grant and any radio installation, 
telephone line, or other communication facilities now or hereafter 
constructed and operated by the United States or any agency thereof. 
This provision shall not relieve the applicant from any responsibility 
or requirement which may be imposed by other lawful authority for 
avoiding or eliminating inductive interference.
    (f) An applicant for a right-of-way for a transmission line across 
Government-owned lands having a voltage of 66 kV or more must, in 
addition to the stipulation required by Sec. 169.5, execute and file 
with its application a stipulation agreeing to accept the right-of-way 
grant subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The applicant agrees that, in the event it becomes necessary for 
the United States to acquire the applicant's transmission line or 
facilities constructed on or across such right-of-way, the United States 
reserves the right to acquire such line or facilities at a sum to be 
determined upon by a representative of the applicant, a representative 
of the Secretary of the Interior, and a third representative to be 
selected by the other two for the purpose of determining the value of 
such property thus to be acquired by the United States.
    (2) To allow the Department of the Interior to utilize for the 
transmission of electrical power any surplus capacity of the line in 
excess of the capacity needed by the holder of the grant for the 
transmission of electrical power in connection with the applicant's 
operations, or to increase the capacity of the line at the Department's 
expense and to utilize the increased capacity for the transmission of 
electrical power. Utilization by the Department of surplus or increased 
capacity shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
    (i) When the Department desires to utilize surplus capacity thought 
to exist in a line, notification will be given to the applicant and the 
applicant shall furnish to the Department within 30 days a certificate 
stating whether the line has any surplus capacity not needed by the 
applicant for the transmission of electrical power in connection with 
the applicant's operations, and, if so, the extent of such surplus 
capacity.
    (ii) In order to utilize any surplus capacity certified by the 
applicant to be available, or any increased capacity provided by the 
Department at its own expense, the Department may interconnect its 
transmission facilities with the applicant's line in a manner 
conformable to approved standards of practice for the interconnection of 
transmission circuits.
    (iii) The expense of interconnection will be borne by the 
Department, and the Department will at all times provide and maintain 
adequate switching, relaying, and protective equipment so as to insure 
that the normal and efficient operation of the applicant's line will not 
be impaired.
    (iv) After any interconnection is completed, the applicant shall 
operate and maintain its line in good condition; and, except in 
emergencies, shall maintain in a closed position all connections under 
the applicant's control between the applicant's line and the 
interconnecting facilities provided by the Department.
    (v) The interconnected power systems of the Department and the 
applicant will be operated in parallel.
    (vi) The transmission of electrical power by the Department over the 
applicant's line will be effected in such manner and quantity as will 
not interfere unreasonably with the applicant's use and operation of the 
line in accordance with the applicant's normal operating standards, 
except that the Department shall have the exclusive right to utilize any 
increased capacity of the line which has been provided at the 
Department's expense.
    (vii) The applicant will not be obligated to allow the transmission 
over

[[Page 474]]

its line by the Department of electrical power to any person receiving 
service from the applicant on the date of the filing of the application 
for a grant, other than persons entitled to statutory preference in 
connection with the distribution and sale of electrical power by the 
Department.
    (viii) The Department will pay to the applicant an equitable share 
of the total monthly cost of maintaining and operating the part of the 
applicant's line utilized by the Department for the transmission of 
electrical power, the payment to be an amount in dollars representing 
the same proportion of the total monthly operation and maintenance cost 
of such part of the line as the maximum amount in kilowatts of the power 
transmitted on a scheduled basis by the Department over the applicant's 
line during the month bears to the total capacity in kilowatts of that 
part of the line. The total monthly cost may include interest and 
amortization, in accordance with the system of accounts prescribed by 
the Federal Power Commission, on the applicant's net total investment 
(exclusive of any investment by the Department) in the part of the line 
utilized by the Department.
    (ix) If, at any time subsequent to a certification by the applicant 
that surplus capacity is available for utilization by the Department, 
the applicant needs for the transmission of electrical power in 
connection with its operations the whole or any part of the capacity of 
the line theretofore certified as being surplus to its needs, the 
applicant may modify or revoke the previous certification by giving the 
Secretary of the Interior 30 months' notice, in advance, of the 
applicant's intention in this respect. After the revocation of a 
certificate, the Department's utilization of the particular line will be 
limited to the increased capacity, if any, provided by the Department at 
its expense.
    (x) If, during the existence of the grant, the applicant desires 
reciprocal accommodations for the transmission of electrical power over 
the interconnecting system of the Department to its line, such 
reciprocal accommodations will be accorded under terms and conditions 
similar to those prescribed in this paragraph with respect to the 
transmission by the Department of electrical power over the applicant's 
line.
    (xi) The terms and conditions prescribed in this paragraph may be 
modified at any time by means of a supplemental agreement negotiated 
between the applicant and the Secretary of the Interior or his designee.
    (g) Applicants may apply for additional lands for generating plants 
and appurtenant facilities. The lands desired for such purposes may be 
indicated on the maps showing the definite location of the right-of-way, 
but separate maps must be filed therefor. Such maps shall show enough of 
the line of route to indicate the position of the tract with respect to 
said line. The tract shall be located with respect to the public survey 
as provided in Sec. 169.8, and all buildings or other structures shall 
be platted on a scale sufficiently large to show clearly their 
dimensions and relative positions.

<R05>
Sec. 170.3  Construction and improvement.

    Subject to the availability of appropriations for Indian reservation 
roads and bridges and any other contribution of State or Indian tribal 
lands, the Commissioner shall plan, survey, design and construct roads 
on the Federal-Aid Indian Road System to provide an adequate system of 
road facilities serving Indian lands.


<R05>
Sec. 170.4  Approval of road construction activities.

    The Secretary of Transportation or his authorized representative 
shall approve the location, type, and design of all projects on the 
Federal-Aid Indian Road System before any construction expenditures are 
made. All such construction shall be under the general supervision of 
the Secretary of Transportation or his authorized representative.

(23 U.S.C. 208)


<R05>
Sec. 170.4a  Selection of road construction projects.

    The Commissioner, who is responsible for the planning, surveys and 
design, shall keep the appropriate local tribal officials informed of 
all technical information relating to the project alternatives of 
proposed road developments. The Commissioner shall recommend to the 
tribe those proposed road projects having the greatest need as 
determined by the comprehensive transportation analysis. Tribes shall

granting any necessary right-of-way are governed by part 169 of this 
chapter. Tribal consent as required under Sec. 169.3(a) may be made by 
public dedication where proper tribal authority exists. Before any work 
is undertaken for the construction of road projects, the Commissioner 
shall obtain the written consent of the Indian landowners. Where an 
Indian has an interest in tribal land by virtue of a land use 
assignment, such consent shall be obtained from both the landholder of 
the assignment and the Indian tribe. Right-of-way easements are to be on 
a form approved by the Commissioner.
    (b) If it appears that the road might be transferred to the tribe, 
the county or the State within 10 years, then before such construction 
is undertaken, right-of-way easements for the project shall be obtained 
in favor of the United States, its successors and assigns, with the 
right to construct, maintain, and repair improvements thereon and 
thereover, for such purposes and with the further right in the United 
States, its successors and assigns, to transfer the right-of-way 
easements by assignment, grant or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 170.5a  Employment of Indians.

    The Bureau of Indian Affairs road program shall be administered in 
such a way as to provide training and employment of Indians. The 
Commissioner may contract with tribes and Indian-owned construction 
companies, or the Commissioner may purchase materials, obtain equipment 
and employ Indian labor in the construction and maintenance of roads.

(36 Stat. 861; 78 Stat. 241, 253; 78 Stat. 257; 25 U.S.C. 47; 42 U.S.C. 
2000e(b), 2000e-2(i); 23 U.S.C. 208(c))


<R05>

bridges is basically a function of the local Government. Subject to the 
availability of funds, the Commissioner shall maintain, or cause to be 
maintained, those approved roads on the Federal-Aid Indian Road System. 
The Commissioner may also maintain roads not on the Federal-Aid Indian 
Road System if such roads meet the definition of ``Indian reservation 
road and bridges'' and are approved for maintenance by the Commissioner. 
No funds authorized under 23 U.S.C. 208 are available for the 
maintenance of roads.

[[Page 477]]


<R05>
Sec. 170.6a  Contributions from tribes.

    The Commissioner may enter into agreements with an Indian tribe for 
a contribution from its tribal funds for the construction or maintenance

<R05>
Sec. 170.8  Use of roads.

    (a) Free public use is required on roads eligible for construction 
and maintenance with Federal funds under this part. When required for 
public safety, fire prevention or suppression, or fish or game 
protection, or to prevent damage to unstable roadbed, the Commissioner 
may restrict the use of them or may close them to public use.
    (b) The Commissioner shall conduct engineering and traffic analysis 
in accordance with established traffic engineering practices and 
determine the necessary maximum speed limit, maximum vehicular weight 
limit and other needed regulatory signs for roads which he maintains. 
The Commissioner shall make recommendations to local Government 
officials, who are authorized to enact and enforce ordinances on Indian 
lands, of his determination of the needed regulatory signs. Such 
regulatory signs as are authorized by established ordinances shall be 
erected by the Commissioner. At locations under the jurisdiction of the 
Court of Indian Offenses the Commissioner shall erect such regulatory 
signs as he determines are needed.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 170.10  Purpose and objectives.

    The regulations in this subpart govern the calling and conducting of 
public hearings on Bureau of Indian Affairs road projects beginning with 
road projects scheduled to begin construction in Fiscal Year 1975, and 
thereafter. In order to promote coordination and comprehensive planning 
of construction activities on Indian reservations, the objectives for 
conducting public hearings on proposed road projects are to:
    (a) Inform interested persons of the road proposals which affect 
them and allow such persons to express their views at those stages of a 
project's development when the flexibility to respond to these views 
still exists.
    (b) Insure that road locations and designs are consistent with the 
reservations' objectives and with applicable Federal regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 170.11  Criteria.

    A public hearing shall be held for each project that:
    (a) Is a new route being constructed,
    (b) Would significantly change the layout or function of connecting

<R05>
Sec. 171.1  Administration.

    (a) The Agency Superintendent, Project Engineer or such official as 
authorized by the Area Director is the Officer-in-Charge of those Indian 
Irrigation Projects or units operated or subject to administration by 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whether or not each project or unit is 
specifically mentioned in this part. The Officer-in-Charge is fully 
authorized to administer, carry out, and enforce these regulations 
either directly or through employees designated by him. Such enforcement 
includes the refusal to deliver water.
    (b) The Officer-in-Charge is authorized to apply to irrigation 
subsistence units or garden tracts only those regulations in this part 
which in his judgment would be applicable in view of the size of the 
units and the circumstances under which they are operated.
    (c) The Officer-in-Charge is responsible for performing such work 
and taking any action which in his judgment is necessary for the proper 
operation, maintenance and administration of the irrigation project or 
unit. In making such judgments, the Officer-in-Charge consults with 
water users and their representatives, and with tribal council 
representatives, and seeks advice on matters of program priorities and 
operational policies. The Officer-in-Charge will be guided by the basic 
requirement that the operation will be so administered as to provide the 
maximum possible benefits from the project's or unit's constructed 
facilities. The operations will insure safe, economical, beneficial, and 
equitable use of the water supply and optimum water conservation.
    (d) The Secretary of the Interior reserves the right to exercise at 
any time all rights, powers, and privileges given him by law, and 
contracts with irrigation districts within Indian Irrigation Projects. 
Close cooperation between the Indian tribal councils, the project water 
users and the Officer-in-Charge is necessary and will be to the 
advantage of the entire project.
    (e) The Area Director, or his delegated representative, is 
authorized to fix as well as to announce, by notice published in the 
Federal Register, the annual operation and maintenance assessment rates 
for the irrigation projects or units within his area of responsibility. 
In addition to the rates, the notices will include such information as 
is pertinent to the assessment, payment, and collections of the charges 
including penalties and duty of water.
    (f) The rates will be based on a carefully prepared estimate of the 
cost of the normal operation and maintenance of the project. Normal 
operation and maintenance is defined for this purpose as the average per 
acre cost of all activities involved in delivering irrigation water and 
maintaining the facilities.
    (g) San Carlos Irrigation Project, Arizona. The administration, 
rights obligations and responsibilities for the operation and 
maintenance of this project are set forth in the Repayment Contract 
dated June 8, 1931 as supplemented or amended, between the San Carlos 
Irrigation and Drainage District and the United States as authorized by 
the Act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 475-476) and the Secretarial Order of 
June 15, 1938, title ``Order Defining Joint, District and Indian Works 
of the San Carlos Federal Irrigation Project: Turning over Operation and 
Maintenance of District Works to the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage 
District.'' The

[[Page 480]]

regulations appearing in this subchapter apply only to the Indian lands 
works and in the San Carlos Irrigation Project unless specified 
otherwise, and should not be interpreted or construed as amending or 
modifying the District Contract or the Secretarial Order.

<R05>
Sec. 171.2  Irrigation season.

    The irrigation season, when water shall be available for irrigation, 
will be established by the Officer-in-Charge.


<R05>
Sec. 171.3  Domestic and stock water.

    Domestic or stock water will not be carried in the project's or 
unit's irrigation system when in the judgment of the Officer-in-Charge 
such practice will:
    (a) Interfere with the operation and maintenance of the system.
    (b) Be detrimental to or endanger the canal, lateral system and/or 
related structures.
    (c) Adversely affect the stored water supply for irrigation.


<R05>
Sec. 171.4  Farm units.

    For the purpose of delivery of water and the administration of the 
project or unit, a farm unit is defined as follows:
    (a) For the Blackfeet, Crow, Fort Belknap, and Fort Peck Irrigation 
Projects, Montana, and the Colville Irrigation Project, Washington.
    (1) Forty (40) or more contiguous acres of land in single ownership 
with the exception that those original Indian allotments containing less 
than 40 irrigable acres of the same subdivision of the public land 
survey shall also be considered farm units.
    (2) Forty (40) or more contiguous acres of Indian-owned land under 
lease to one party.
    (3) Forty (40) contiguous acres in multiple ownership within the 
same forty (40) acre subdivision of the public land survey.
    (b) For the Fort Hall Irrigation Project, Idaho:
    (1) Twenty (20) or more contiguous acres of land in single ownership 
covered by one or more water rights contracts.
    (2) Twenty (20) or more contiguous acres of Indian-owned land under 
lease to one party or being farmed by one Indian.
    (3) Ten (10) or more contiguous acres of subdivided land in multiple 
ownership.
    (c) For the Flathead Irrigation Project, Montana: A contiguous area 
of land in single ownership containing not less than one forty (40) acre 
subdivision of the public land survey, or the original allotment as 
established by the Secretary of the Interior and as recorded or amended 
in the records of the Bureau of Land Management. In the case of leased 
land, it is defined as a contiguous area under a single lease. For 
Bureau of Land Management regulations pertaining to Flathead Project, 
see 43 CFR 2211.8, Flathead Irrigation District, Montana.
    (d) For the Wapato Irrigation Project (all units), Washington:
    (1) Eighty (80) or more contiguous acres in single ownership at the 
time of the establishment of the delivery system, or when subsequent 
changes of ownership result in larger tracts under single ownership and 
the owner requests that this land be treated as a farm unit, whether 
covered by one or more water right contracts.
    (2) Eighty (80) or more contiguous acres of Indian-owned land under 
lease to one person or being farmed by one Indian.
    (3) Eighty (80) contiguous acres in multiple ownership: Provided, 
That such acreage shall be within the same eight (80) acre subdivision 
of the U.S. public land survey.
    (4) In all cases where an original Indian allotment consisted of 
less than eighty (80) contiguous acres, such original Indian allotment, 
whether (i) under single or multiple ownership and/or covered by one or 
more water right contracts, (ii) under lease to the same or different 
lessees, or (iii) farmed by one or more Indians, shall be treated as a 
farm unit.
    (e) For all other projects or units: An original allotment, 
homestead, an assignment of unallotted tribal lands, or a contiguous, 
development lease area.

[[Page 481]]


<R05>
Sec. 171.5  Delivery points.

    (a) Project operators will deliver irrigation water to one point on 
the boundary of each farm unit within the irrigation project. The 
Officer-in-Charge may establish additional delivery points when in his 
judgment it is impractical for the landowner to irrigate his farm unit 
from the one delivery point for such reasons as topography, isolation, 
or cost. When irrigation water is supplied from wells, the delivery 
point may be established at the well head. Where portions of a farm unit 
lie at an elevation too high to be watered by gravity flow from the 
normal elevation of water in the project distribution system, no change 
will be made in the water level elevation of the project system so as to 
place water on such land. Where such land has been included in the 
project, the landowner may install and operate pumping equipment at his 
own expense to raise the water to such included land from a point 
designated by the Officer-in-Charge and in accordance with his 
specifications. If the landowner so installs pumping equipment and pays 
the construction and maintenance charges, the project will deliver the 
same amount of water per acre for this land as the project delivers at 
the delivery point for other lands on the project.
    (b) If a farm unit for which a project delivery point has been 
established is subsequently subdivided into smaller units by the owner 
or owners of the farm unit, the following provisions apply:
    (1) A plat or map of the subdivision must be recorded and a copy 
filed with the Officer-in-Charge. The plat or map must show how the 
irrigation water is to be delivered to the irrigable acres in the 
subdivision.
    (2) No further extensions or alterations in the project's system 
will be provided officials to serve the subdivided units, except as 
agreed to by the Officer-in-Charge and at the landowner's expense.
    (3) Any additional construction necessary to deliver irrigation 
water to these units must be mutually worked out between the original 
owner of the farm units and the new owners of the subdivided unit at 
their expense.
    (4) The project will not bear any responsibility for the operation 
and maintenance of such internal systems, or the division of irrigation 
water after it is delivered to the established project delivery points.
    (c) Where project points of delivery have been established for farm 
units which are to be combined under lease or ownership into a singular 
farm unit to be irrigated by means of a sprinkler of more efficient 
system, the Officer-in-Charge may approve the removal or relocation of 
project delivery facilities. Such reorganization shall be at the expense 
of the landowners or lessees in conformance with established project 
standards and a time schedule which will not disrupt water delivery 
service to others on the system.
    (d) Where a reorganization has been approved and established as in 
Sec. 171.5(c), any reversion requiring reestablishment of removed or 
relocated project delivery facilities must be approved by the Officer-
in-Charge and conform to established project standards and time 
schedules which will not disrupt water delivery service to other water 
users on the system. All expenses incurred shall be the responsibility 
of the landowners or lessees.


<R05>
Sec. 171.6  Distribution and apportionment of water.

    (a) The Officer-in-Charge will establish the method of and 
procedures for the delivery and distribution of the available irrigation 
water supply. He will endeavor to apportion the water at all times on a 
fair and equitable basis between all project water users entitled to the 
receipt of irrigation water.
    (b) Any person who interferes with the flow of water in or from the 
project's storage, carriage or lateral systems or opens or closes or in 
any other way changes the position of a headgate or any other water 
control structure without specific authority from the Officer-in-Charge 
or his designated representative will be subject to prosecution. Cutting 
a canal or lateral bank for the purpose of diverting water or placing an 
obstruction in such facilities in order to change the flow of water 
through a headgate will be considered a violation of this section.

[[Page 482]]

    (c) San Carlos Irrigation Project, Arizona--(1) The portion of the 
project's common water supply available for the Indian lands will be 
distributed subject to beneficial use in equal per acre amounts to each 
acre under irrigation and cultivation, insofar as possible.
    (2) All water users (Indian and non-Indian) will be notified at the 
beginning of the irrigation season of the amount of stored and pumped 
water available. An apportionment of this water will be recommended by 
the Officer-in-Charge of the irrigation project to the approval of the 
Area Director. Subsequent apportionments may be made if and when 
additional water is available.
    (3) If it is determined by the Officer-in-Charge that there is water 
in excess of demands and available storage facilities, he will promptly 
notify all water users that such water is available. This water shall 
not be charged against the water apportionment of the land on which it 
is used.
    (d) Uintah Irrigation Project, Utah--(1) Water will be delivered to 
all lands under the Lakefork, Uintah and Whiterocks Rivers in accordance 
with the provisions of the decree of the Federal Court in the cases of 
the ``United States v. Dry Gulch Irrigation Company, et al.,'' and the 
``United States v. Cedarview Irrigation Company, et al.,'' which decrees 
fix the maximum duty of three (3) acre-feet per acre for the period from 
March 1 to November 1 of each year. The rate of delivery will be 
substantially in accordance with the following schedule except that it 
may be modified by the Officer-in-Charge at such times as changed 
climatic conditions and the water supply indicate that such modification 
would be beneficial to the project.

    (2) The rotation method will be used in distributing the water 
diverted from the Lakefork, Uintah and Whiterocks Rivers. Rotation 
schedules will be prepared under direction of the Officer-in-Charge and 
will be put into effect each season as soon as it is determined what 
acreage is to be irrigated. A written copy of the water schedule will be 
delivered to each water user showing the time that his turn starts on 
each tract and the duration of each turn.
    (3) In the event a rotation system is adopted for lands receiving 
water from the Duchesne River, the same procedure will be used as for 
the lands under the Lakefork, Uintah and Whiterocks Rivers. The Officer-
in-Charge will advise all water users sufficiently in advance of the 
time the rotation schedule will go into effect.
    (e) Wapato Irrigation Project, Washington--(1) To protect adjoining 
lands against seepage and erosion by the excess use of water on the 
bench lands of the Wapato-Satus Unit, the maximum delivery of water to 
the bench lands shall not exceed 4.5 acre-feet per acre per season.
    (2) The rate of delivery to lands of the Satus 2 and Satus 3 
subunits shall not exceed one (1) cubic foot per second for each 50 
irrigated acres.
    (3) The measurement and distribution of water for the lands on the 
Ahtanum Unit shall take place at the mutually advantageous points on the 
Ahtanum Main or Lower Canals. The conveyance of the water from these 
points of distribution to the irrigable acres of the farm units shall be 
entirely by and at the expense of the individual operators of the farms. 
However, when several such users join together to use one single channel 
for the conveyance of their water to the points of final diversion, they 
shall be jointly responsible for the channel of conveyance

[[Page 483]]

and the apportionment of the water to their respective farm units.


<R05>
Sec. 171.7  Application for and record of deliveries of irrigation water.

    (a) Except when rotation schedules have been established and are 
being followed, water users in requesting the delivery of water will so 
notify the Officer-in-Charge or his designated representative by such 
means and with such advance notice as may be required by system 
operations and as established by the Officer-in-Charge. The request 
shall indicate the time the water is to be delivered, the period of time 
it will be used, the rate of flow desired, and where the water will be 
used.
    (b) It is the responsibility of the ditchriders during the 
irrigation season to maintain records showing the beginning and ending 
time of each water delivery, the amount of such delivery, and the 
estimated acreage irrigated. Such records are to be filed at the 
irrigation project office at the end of the season.
    (c) Water users on the Indian portion of the San Carlos Indian 
Irrigation Project will submit their requests for water to the 
Superintendent, Pima Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 171.8  Surface drainage.

    (a) The water users will be responsible for all waste water 
resulting from their irrigation practices and for its conveyance to 
project canals, drains, wasteways or natural drainage channels. Any 
expenses involved in doing this will be borne by the water user. Waste 
water may be emptied into project constructed ditches only at points 
designated by and in a manner approved by the Officer-in-Charge. In 
those situations involving two or more landowners and/or water users, it 
is their responsibility to work out a satisfactory arrangement among 
themselves for the conveyance of their waste water to project ditches or 
natural drainage channels.
    (b) Waste water shall not be permitted to flow upon or collect in 
road or project rights-of-way. Failure to comply with this requirement 
could result in the Officer-in-Charge refusing the further delivery of 
water.


<R05>
Sec. 171.9  Structures.

    (a) All structures, including bridges or other crossings, which are 
necessary as a part of the project's irrigation and drainage system will 
be installed and maintained by the project.
    (b) During the construction of a new irrigation project or the 
extension of an existing project, bridges, crossings or other structures 
may be built by the Officer-in-Charge for private use where justified by 
severance agreements or other practical considerations. Title to these 
structures may or may not be vested in the United States depending upon 
the agreement with the landowner. Structures built partially or wholly 
in lieu of severance damages may be required to be maintained by the 
landowner even though title remains with the United States.
    (c) After a project is completed, additional structures crossing or 
encroaching on project canal, lateral or drain rights-of-way which are 
needed for private use may be constructed privately in accordance with 
plans approved by the Officer-in-Charge or by the project. In either 
case the cost of installing such structures will not be at the project's 
expense. Such structures will be constructed and maintained under 
revocable permits on proper forms issued by the Officer-in-Charge of the 
irrigation project to the party or parties desiring such structures.
    (d) It it is determined that a crossing constructed for and by the 
project is no longer needed for operation and maintenance of the system. 
It should be removed. However, if a private party, corporation, State, 
or other Federal entity desires to use the crossing, it may be 
transferred to such entity by the Officer-in-Charge under a permit which 
relieves the United States from any further liability or responsibility 
for the crossing, including its maintenance. The following provisions 
pertain:
    (1) Permits issued in such situations shall stipulate what is 
granted, and accepted by the permittee on the condition that the repair 
and maintenance of the structure shall be the duty of the permittee or 
his successors without cost to the irrigation project.

[[Page 484]]

    (2) The permit shall further provide that if any such structure is 
not regularly used for a period of one year or is not properly 
maintained, the Officer-in-Charge may notify the person responsible for 
the structure's maintenance either to remove it or to correct any unsafe 
conditions within a period of 90 days.
    (3) If the structure is not removed or the unsafe condition 
corrected within the time allowed, it may be removed by the Officer-in-
Charge, the cost of such removal to be paid by the party responsible for 
the maintenance of the structure.


<R05>
Sec. 171.10  Fencing.

    Fences across project rights-of-way will not be constructed without 
the approval of the Officer-in-Charge. The granting of such approval 
shall be dependent upon proper installation so as not interfere with the 
flow of water or the passage of project operators and equipment. In case 
an unauthorized fence is installed, the landowner shall be notified to 
remove it. If it is not removed within a reasonable period of time or 
satisfactory arrangements made with the Officer-in-Charge, it may be 
removed by project personnel at the landowner's expense.


<R05>
Sec. 171.11  Obstructions.

    No obstructions of any kind including service or farm ditches, will 
be permitted upon project rights-of-way. Due notice will be given to an 
operator or landowner to remove any obstructions. If not removed within 
a reasonable period of time after notice is given, an obstruction will 
be removed by project forces at the expense of the operator or 
landowner.


<R05>
Sec. 171.12  Rights-of-way.

    (a) Rights-of-way reserved for the project's irrigation system are 
of sufficient width to permit passage and use of equipment necessary for

    (a) The Officer-in-Charge is authorized to furnish irrigation water 
for leaching purposes without the payment of operation and maintenance 
charges to any Indian trust land, or patent in fee land covered by a 
repayment contract, as an aid to improve land within the project that is 
impregnated by alkali or in the development of new project land.

[[Page 485]]

    (b) Delivery of such water will depend upon the availability of 
water and the preparation of a definite plan of operation by the land 
operator satisfactory to the Officer-in-Charge. In addition, the 
operator shall agree to meet such reasonable leaching and cropping 
activities as shall be prescribed by the Officer-in-Charge.
    (c) If prompt and beneficial use of the leaching water is not made 
by or before July 1 of the season for which it is granted, the Officer-
in-Charge may declare the leaching permit forfeited. The normal water 
charges will be considered as assessed and any delinquency enforced as 
though no leaching privilege had been granted.

<R05>
Sec. 171.16  Excess water.

    (a) General. On those irrigation projects where a water duty or 
water quota has been established each water user will be notified when 
his quota of water, as covered by the basic assessment and as announced 
in the public notice, has been delivered. In such cases, additional 
irrigation water, if available, may be delivered providing the water 
user so requests it and agrees to pay for the excess water in accordance 
with the excess water provisions as set forth in the public notice.
    (b) Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, Montana. (1) After an 
agreement has been reached by the Commissioners of the irrigation 
district and the Officer-in-Charge as to the duty of water on individual 
tracts where water users claim excess requirements above the duty of 
water established for the project on account of porous or gravelly 
soils, the Officer-in-Charge is authorized to increase the quantity of 
water to be delivered to such tracts.
    (2) The amount of water delivered in such cases will not exceed four 
(4) acre feet per assessable acre except in the Moiese Division where 
the amount shall not exceed six (6) acre feet providing there is 
sufficient water available in Lower Crow Reservoir without having to 
draw on the water supply for the Mission Valley Division.
    (3) The charge for such water shall be at the same general rate as 
established for project land not having such a porous or gravely 
condition.


<R05>
Sec. 171.17  Delivery of water.

    (a) Irrigation water will not be delivered until the annual 
operation and maintenance assessments are paid in accordance with the 
established annual rate schedule as set forth in the public notice 
issued by the Area Director. Under the following special circumstances, 
this rule may be waived and water delivered to:
    (1) Trust and restricted lands farmed by the Indian owner when the 
Superintendent has certified that the operator is financially unable to 
pay the assessment and he has made arrangements to pay such assessments 
from the proceeds received from the sale of crops or from any other 
source of income. In such cases the unpaid charges will stand as a first 
lien against the land until paid but without penalty on account of 
delinquency.
    (2) Non-Indian lands on which there is an approved deferred payment 
contract executed under the provisions of the Act of June 22, 1936 (49 
Stat, 1803).
    (3) Land on which an adjustment or cancellation of unpaid 
assessments has been recommended and final action is pending.
    (b) Water will not be delivered to Indian trust or restricted land 
that are under lease approved by the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative acting under delegated authority until the 
lessee has paid the annual assessed operation and maintenance charges.
    (c) No water will be delivered to Indian trust land under a lease 
that has been negotiated by an Indian owner until the owner has paid the 
annual assessed operation and maintenance charges or has made 
satisfactory arrangements for their payment with the Superintendent who 
has so notified the Officer-in-Charge.
    (d) Water will not be delivered to any lands within an irrigation 
district which has executed a repayment contract with the United States 
until all irrigation charges, as assessed, are paid

[[Page 486]]

in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts and the 
public notice as issued by the Area Director.
    (e) All irrigation districts may make such rules and regulations as 
they may find necessary in regard to the delivery of the water to water 
users within the district who are delinquent in their payments to the 
district of assessed irrigation charges. Such rules and regulations will 
be adhered to by the Officer-in-Charge when it appears to be in the best 
interests of the United States and the district to do so.
    (f) Water will not be delivered to lands that are subject to 
construction assessments not paid in accordance with part 134 of this 
chapter.
    (g) Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, Montana--(1) Secretarial 
Water Right holders. (i) For all acres recognized by the Secretary of 
the Interior as entitled to a ``Secretarial Water Right'', the Officer-
in-Charge is authorized to carry such water in the project's carriage 
and distribution system and deliver it: Providing, That landowner 
holding such a right requests it and his land is so located that the 
water can be delivered without undue expense to the project. Before this 
service is provided, the landowner must also agree to pay a minimum of 
fifty (50) percent of up to a maximum of one hundred (100) percent of 
the annual operation and maintenance charges as assessed against project 
lands in the same general area as his. Under such agreement the project 
will not be obligated to deliver more than that allowed for each acre of 
land under the Secretary's private water right findings less a 
proportionate share of the project's normal losses in transporting the 
water from the point of entry into the project's system to the point of 
delivery.
    (ii) ``Secretarial Water rights'' are defined as those rights 
allocated to Indian allotments by the Assistant Secretary of the 
Interior by his approval on November 25, 1921, of the findings of the 
Commission appointed by him to investigage the ``private rights'' on the 
Flathead Indian Reservation. Authority: Sec. 9, Act of May 29, 1908 (35 
Stat. 449).
    (2) Pump lands--Flathead Irrigation Project. (i) The Officer-in-
Charge is authorized to deliver irrigation water to lands (pump lands) 
within a project farm unit that are too high to be served from the 
project's gravity flow system: Providing, The holder of legal title to 
the lands so requests it in writing and agrees to have such land 
designated by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative as a part of the irrigation project. Land so designated 
shall be subject to the assessment and payment of the pro rata per acre 
share of the project's construction, operation and maintenance costs the 
same as all other lands within the irrigation project in the same 
general area. In addition, such ``pump lands'' shall be obligated to pay 
an additional assessment on an annual basis as determined by the 
Officer-inCharge to defray the cost of pumping the water from the 
Flathead River for those lands in the Mission Valley Division, and from 
the Little Bitterroot Lake for lands in the Camas Division.
    (ii) At the time he submits the request, the landowner must also 
agree in writing to include the ``pump lands'' in an existing irrigation 
district or a district that may be subsequently formed pursuant to the 
laws of the State of Montana. This will not apply to Indian trust or 
restricted lands as such lands cannot be included within an irrigation 
district.
    (iii) A request for the inclusion of ``pump lands'' into the project 
will not be considered until the Officer-in-Charge determines that there 
is sufficient project water available to serve these lands without 
adversely affecting in any way the water entitlement of the designated 
project lands for which the project was designed and constructed.
    (iv) All costs incidental to the pumping and distribution of the 
delivered water from the project farm unit delivery point to the ``pump 
lands'' shall be borne by the landowner.


<R05>
Sec. 171.18  Service or farm ditches.

    The service or farm ditches into which water is delivered from 
project canals or laterals must have ample capacity and be maintained by 
the water user in proper condition to receive water and convey it to the 
place of use with a minimum of loss. Water delivery

[[Page 487]]

will be refused to such ditches not satisfactorily maintained. Project 
irrigation water shall be put to beneficial use.


<R05>
Sec. 171.19  Operation and maintenance assessments.

    (a) Operation and maintenance assessments will be levied against the 
acreage within each allotment, farm unit or tribal unit that is 
designated as assessable and to which irrigation water can be delivered 
by the project operators from the constructed works whether water is 
requested or not, unless specified otherwise in this section.
    (1) Colville Indian Irrigation Project, Washington. Operation and 
maintenance assessments will be levied against all patent in fee and 
Indian trust lands to which water can be delivered for irrigation and 
for which an application for water has been made by the water user and 
approved by the Superintendent.
    (2) Wapato Irrigation Project-Toppenish-Simcoe Unit, Washington. 
Operation and maintenance assessments will be levied against all lands 
which can be irrigated from the constructed works for which application 
for water is made annually and approved by the Project Engineer.
    (b) Subdivided farm units--(1) General. (i) Where farm units, as 
defined in Sec. 171.4 have been subdivided into smaller units, the Area 
Director or such official as he may so delegate may, at his discretion, 
fix a higher operation and maintenance rate for such subdivided acreage 
than the rate fixed for the acreage in the original farm unit. In such 
cases the higher rate will also be announced in the annual public 
notice.
    (ii) In the event higher rates are fixed for a subdivided farm unit, 
the individual owners thereof may obtain for their lands the same rate 
as fixed for acreages within farm units not so divided by joining in a 
written contract with the other owners within the subdivided unit. Under 
such a contract, the various owners will appoint an agent in whom shall 
be vested full power and authority to enter into a contract with the 
Area Director, hereafter referred to as the Contracting Officer, or such 
official as he may so authorize, covering the water rights for the 
entire area of the several small acreages: Provided, however, Such 
contract must not represent less acreage than that included in the 
original farm unit unless a smaller unit has been established by project 
regulation as eligible for a subdivision contract; And provided further, 
That whether the contract involves acreage in one or more farm units, it 
must represent contiguous acreages.
    (iii) The contract between the agent of the owners of the small 
tracts and the Contracting Officer shall be executed on or before 
February 1 of the year preceding the next irrigation season. The agent 
shall at the time of the execution of this contract, on a form approved 
by the Secretary of the Interior, furnish a certified copy of the 
contract executed by the several landowners of the subdivided tract 
appointing the agent to act in their behalf.
    (iv) Any owner of a tract within a subdivided unit, with the written 
consent of the owners of a majority of the acreage, under a contract as 
set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, may voluntarily 
withdraw from the contract by filing a written notice of his intent to 
withdraw with the Contracting Officer on or before February 1 of the 
year, such withdrawal is to be effective, together with the consent of 
the owners of the majority of the acreage endorsed thereon; Provided, 
That, the remaining acreage is contiguous; such withdrawal does not 
reduce the remaining acreage under the contract to less than the acreage 
included in the original farm unit before it was subdivided or less than 
the minimum acreage established on a project as eligible for a 
subdivision contract; and all irrigation charges due under said contract 
have been paid. Upon the receipt of said notice, the Contracting 
Officer, if the notice meets the requirements as herein provided, shall 
note his approval thereon and send a copy thereof to the agent of the 
landowners. Thereafter the land of the withdrawing owner shall no longer 
be subject to the contract.
    (v) If one or more owners under a contract desire to withdraw, and 
if, by so doing, it would reduce the total remaining contiguous acreage 
under the contract to less than the total acreage included in the 
original farm unit, or

[[Page 488]]

the minimum eligible acreage established on the project, the contract 
can be terminated. However, before such a termination can be approved, a 
written notice from the owners of the majority of the acreage must be 
filed with the Contracting Officer indicating their consent to and 
requesting his approval of the termination. The notice must be filed on 
or before February 1 of the year the termination is to become effective, 
and must include the payment of any irrigation charges then due under 
the existing contract. Upon the receipt of the written notice, the 
contracting Officer shall note his approval thereon provided that the 
requirements set forth herein are satisfied. A copy of the approved 
notice will be given to the agent of the landowners concerned.
    (2) Fort Hall Irrigation Project. The Superintendent, Fort Hall 
Agency, is authorized to approve contracts as set forth in this section 
as well as withdrawals or termination of such contracts. However, no 
contracts will be entered into if the total contiguous acreage is less 
than 10 acres.
    (3) Wapato Irrigation Project. The Project Engineer is authorized to 
approve contracts as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, as well 
as withdrawals or termination of such contracts. However, no contracts 
will be entered into if the total contiguous acreage is less than 40 
acres.


<R05>
Sec. 171.20  Water users' ledgers.

    (a) Water users' ledgers will be maintained by the Officer-in-Charge 
on all irrigation projects or units where irrigation assessments are 
levied and collected. Separate entries shall be made in the ledger for 
each farm tract, and bills issued to the owner or owners of record. When 
payment is received, it will be credited to the proper ledger account.
    (b) When Indian trust or restricted land is leased and the Officer-
in-Charge has been so advised by the Superintendent, irrigation bills 
will be submitted to the lessee. Upon receipt of payment, it will be 
credited to the Indian owner or owners of record in the ledger account.

them to agree among themselves as to the five or less of them who shall 
acquire the tract. If agreement among the owners is obtained, those 
individuals who are to acquire the tract shall then file an application 
to purchase it. The matter of reaching agreement among the owners is the 
sole responsibility of said owners and not the responsibility of the 
Department of the Interior and/or the Bureau of Indian Affairs to 
participate in the negotiations between the owners. If the former owners 
fail to reach such an agreement, all applications for the tract shall be 
rejected.

Sec. 178.4  Notice to former owners.

    After publication of these regulations, there shall be published in 
the Federal Register notice that certain described lands and interests 
in lands have been transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the 
Secretary and are available for repurchase by the former owners pursuant 
to section 3(b) of the Act. Upon transfer of administrative jurisdiction 
over lands that may thereafter be declared excess to the needs of the 
Department of the Air Force and acceptance by the Secretary, notice of 
such transfer shall be published in the Federal Register. No attempt 
shall be made to notify each individual former non-Indian owner 
personally, but the transfer of jurisdiction to the Secretary may be 
further publicized by the publishing of notice in a local newspaper of 
general circulation.


<R05>
Sec. 178.5  Special notice to former Indian owners.

    (a) The Superintendent shall notify the former Indian owners, in 
writing, at their last known addresses of their right to repurchase the 
tracts formerly owned by them in those instances where the tracts are 
outside of the boundaries of the Monument and are outside of the 
boundaries of the area of the Gunnery Range retained by the Department 
of the Air Force. Such notice shall include (1) the legal description; 
(2) the purchase price thereof; (3) the minimum amount of down payment 
required; (4) a recital that balance of purchase price may be paid in 20 
annual installments; (5) the annual rate of interest on unpaid balance; 
(6) information whether title is to be taken in trust or in fee; and (7) 
the date by which the executed application to purchase must be received 
in the office of the Superintendent. A form of application for execution 
by the former owners shall accompany said notice, said application to 
include the legal description of the land, purchase price and other 
pertinent information.
    (b) In those instances where the tracts of land or portions thereof 
are within the boundaries of the area of the Gunnery Range retained by 
the Department of the Air Force, the Superintendent shall notify the 
former Indian owners, in writing, at their last known addresses that 
they may elect to purchase available tracts of land in lieu of the lands 
formerly owned by them, said lieu lands to be of substantially the same 
value as the tracts originally owned by them. Such notice shall also 
advise said former owners that they may, as an alternative, elect to 
purchase the tracts formerly owned by them at such time as the tracts 
may be declared excess to the needs of the Department of the Air Force 
and transferred to the Secretary of the Interior. As to this 
alternative, no promise or prediction may be made as to when, or 
whether, the land may eventually become surplus to the needs of the 
Department of the Air Force, and the notice shall specifically so state. 
Such notice shall include (1) the legal description of the land formerly 
owned by them; (2) the purchase price of the lieu land which price shall 
be computed on the same basis as though the original tract were 
available; (3) the minimum amount of down payment required; (4) a 
recital that balance of purchase price may be paid in 20 annual 
installments; (5) the annual rate of interest on unpaid balance; (6) 
information whether title is to be taken in trust or in fee; and (7) the 
date by which election to purchase lieu lands or wait until lands 
formerly owned by them are declared excess must be received in the 
office of the Superintendent. The notice shall be accompanied by a form 
for execution by the former owner whereby said owner elects to purchase 
lieu lands or to repurchase the tract formerly owned by said owner when 
it is declared excess.

[[Page 500]]

    (c) In those instances where a tract of land or portion thereof is 
within the boundaries of the Monument, the Superintendent shall notify 
the former Indian owner, in writing, at his last known address that he 
may elect to acquire a life estate in such tract or portion thereof at 
no cost but subject to the restrictions on use referred to under 
``Conveyance Documents'' (Sec.  257.7). Such notice shall include the 
legal description of the lands formerly owned by him upon which he may 
acquire a life estate. The notice shall also inform the former owner 
that he may elect to purchase any available tract of land in lieu of the 
lands formerly owned by him, said lieu lands to have substantially the 
same values as the tract originally owned by him. Such notice shall 
include (1) the purchase price of the lieu land which price shall be 
computed on the same basis as though the original tract were available 
for purchase; (2) the minimum amount of down payment required; (3) a 
recital that balance of purchase price may be paid in 20 annual 
installments; (4) the annual rate of interest on unpaid balance; (5) 
information whether title is to be taken in trust or in fee; and (6) the 
date by which the election to acquire the life estate or lieu lands must 
be received in the Office of the Superintendent. Such notice shall be 
accompanied by a form for execution by the former owner whereby said 
owner elects to acquire a life estate in the lands formerly owned by 
said owner or elects to purchase lieu lands.


<R05>
Sec. 178.6  Applications by former owners.

    (a) Applications by former Indian owners to purchase lands formerly 
owned by them, or to purchase lieu lands, or to take a life estate in a 
tract of land within the Monument area should be made on forms furnished 
by the Superintendent and filed within the period specified in section 
3(b) (5) of the Act. Such applications shall be filed in the Office of 
the Superintendent.
    (b) A former non-Indian owner may file application to purchase land 
pursuant to section 3(b) of the Act within 1 year from the date notice 
is published in the Federal Register that the land he formerly owned has 
been declared excess to the needs of the Department of the Air Force and 
has been transferred to the Secretary. Such application shall be filed 
in the Office of the Superintendent. The applicant shall furnish proof 
of his ownership or the ownership of his predecessor in interest at the 
time of the acquisition of the land by the United States. Upon receipt 
of an application to purchase and proof of ownership the Superintendent 
shall cause the land to be appraised and thereafter he shall inform the 
applicant in writing of the fair market value of the tract which shall 
be the purchase price, the minimum amount of down payment required, that 
the balance of the purchase price may be paid in 20 annual installments, 
and the annual rate of interest on the unpaid balance.


<R05>
Sec. 178.7  Conveyance documents.

    (a) Where there is an election by a former Indian owner of a tract 
of land within the monument boundary to acquire a life estate in such 
tract at no cost the following types of provisions and restrictions 
shall be applicable to the use thereof:
    (1) Agricultural uses are permitted. Only those commercial 
activities associated with normal agricultural operations would be 
allowed.
    (2) Construction or reconstruction of any roads to the property, 
including locations and materials used, are subject to approval by the 
National Park Service.
    (3) Mining activities of all kinds are prohibited inasmuch as the 
United States retains all mineral rights.
    (4) Residential and other facilities necessary for, or incidental 
to, ranching and other agricultural purposes are permitted. This 
includes, but is not limited to, barns, sheds, fences, stock dams, wells 
utilizing surface or subsurface water, and other needed access accessory 
structures.
    (5) The cutting of native trees, except for firewood for the 
personal use of the grantee, his family or assignee, is prohibited 
unless determined by the National Park Service to be essential to the 
permitted use of the tract.
    (6) All improvements and structures are subject to removal upon 
termination of the life estate or they shall

[[Page 501]]

be deemed to become the property of the United States. The family or 
assignee of the grantee shall have a reasonable time to vacate the 
premises upon termination of the life estate and may harvest annual 
crops planted during the tenure of the estate.
    (7) Water rights owned by the United States in the premises remain 
vested in the United States, but the grantee has a right to reasonable 
use of the water.
    (8) Grantee must observe and adhere to all applicable Federal, 
State, and local laws and regulations, including Federal laws and 
regulations for the protection of the black-footed ferret and other 
wildlife in the Monument. The United States reserves the right to enter 
upon the conveyed lands to assure such compliance and for the exercise 
of any other rights and privileges reserved to it.
    (9) The conveyed premises must be kept in a neat and orderly 
condition and no waste or injury may be committed to the land. Pollution 
of water on or adjacent to the property is prohibited.
    (10) Reasonable precautions must be taken to prevent, suppress, and 
extinguish forest, brush, grass, and other fires on the property.
    (11) Grantee may not claim damages for injury by or against the 
United States which might be directly attributable to existence of the 
Monument.
    (12) Other provisions deemed necessary by the National Park Service 
in individual circumstances may be included in the conveyance document.
    (b) When title to the land being acquired is to be taken in trust 
for the purchaser and the purchase is effected by deferred payments as 
authorized in section 3(b)(2) of the Act, a sale contract shall be 
executed by the purchaser and the Secretary. The down payment shall be 
not less than $100 or 20 per centum of the purchase price, whichever is 
less. The purchaser shall be entitled to a credit of a pro rata share of 
the grazing fees collected by the United States for use of the land 
during the grazing year in which the sale contract is executed, which 
credit shall be applied as all or a part of the down payment for the 
land being purchased. In the event the proportionate share of the 
grazing fees credited to the purchaser is less than the required down 
payment, the purchaser shall pay the balance of the down payment in 
cash, or by certified check, cashier's check, money order, or U.S. 
Treasury check, payable to the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the time the 
sale contract is executed. Upon execution of the contract by the 
Secretary, a deed shall be prepared and executed by the Secretary 
conveying title to the land to the United States in trust for the 
purchaser. When the sale contract and deed are executed, the balance of 
the proportionate share of the grazing fees, if any, due the purchaser 
shall be paid to him and the down payment shall be deposited in the U.S. 
Treasury to the credit of the United States as general fund receipts. 
All subsequent installment payments shall be deposited in a like manner 
to the credit of the United States. The sale contract shall include (1) 
the legal description of the land; (2) the purchase price; (3) the 
amount of down payment; (4) the amount of annual principal installment 
payments; (5) the annual rate of interest on unpaid balance; (6) the due 
dates of annual installments; (7) a recital that the unpaid balance is a 
lien against the land and against all rents, bonuses and royalties 
received therefrom; (8) a recital that a delinquency of 90 days in 
making annual installment payments will subject the contract to 
foreclosure with loss of all payments theretofore made thereon; and (9) 
a recital that upon payment being made in full the deed to the United 
States in trust for the purchaser will be delivered to the purchaser.
    (c) If title to the tract is acquired in a trust status and full 
payment therefor is made by the purchaser at the time the application 
for purchase is approved, the title shall be conveyed to the United 
States of America in trust for the purchaser by a deed executed by the 
Secretary.
    (d) If the purchaser is to acquire the tract in a fee status and the 
purchase is effected by deferred payments as authorized in section 
3(b)(2) of the Act, the title shall be conveyed to the purchaser in a 
fee status by a deed executed by the Secretary. The purchaser shall 
execute a mortgage naming the United States as mortgagee and shall

[[Page 502]]

execute promissory notes for the annual installment payments with the 
annual rate of interest set forth therein. The deed and mortgage shall 
be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county in 
which the land is situated, the recording costs to be borne by the 
purchaser. Upon payment of the full amount of the mortgage a 
satisfaction of mortgage shall be executed by the Secretary and 
delivered to the purchaser who shall be responsible for recordation 
thereof in the office of the register of deeds.
    (e) If the purchaser is to acquire the tract in a fee status and 
full payment therefor is made by the purchaser at the time the 
application for purchase is approved, the title shall be conveyed to 
said purchaser in a fee status by a deed executed by the Secretary. The 
purchaser shall be responsible for recordation of the deed in the office 
of the register of deeds of the county in which the land is situated.
    (f) Each deed executed pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section shall contain a provision that if the tract is offered for 
sale by the purchaser within a period of 10 years from the date of said 
deed, the tribe shall be notified in writing that the tract is being 
offered for sale and of the terms of the offer and said tribe shall have 
a period of 60 days to exercise a right of first refusal to purchase 
such tract upon the terms set forth in the notice.
    (g) All sale documents referred to in this section shall be recorded 
in the office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs having custody of the land 
title records of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation pursuant to 25 CFR 
part 150.


<R05>
Sec. 178.8  Selection of lieu lands.

    (a) Lieu lands which may be selected for purchase by former Indian 
owners whose lands are within the boundaries of the area retained for 
use by the Department of the Air Force or are within the boundaries of 
the Monument are defined as (1) those lands heretofore acquired by the 
United States for use of the Air Force Gunnery Range which are outside 
the boundaries of the Monument and outside the boundaries of the area 
retained for use by the Department of the Air Force which are not 
selected for repurchase by former owners within 1 year from date of 
publication of the notice prescribed in section 3(b)(5) of the Act, and 
(2) all of the submarginal lands acquired by the United States under 
authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and subsequent 
relief acts, within the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, except those 
submarginal lands within the area retained for use by the Department of 
the Air Force or within the Monument, administrative jurisdiction over 
which was transferred to the Secretary of the Interior by Executive 
Order No. 7368, dated April 15, 1938.
    (b) The former Indian owners whose lands are within the boundaries 
of the area retained for use by the Department of the Air Force or are 
within the boundaries of the Monument may elect to purchase lieu lands 
of substantially the same value pursuant to section 4(b) and section 
4(c) of the Act. Inasmuch as identification of all of the lands from 
which lieu selections may be made cannot be determined until the time 
has expired for former owners of lands outside of the area used by the 
Department of the Air Force and outside the boundaries of the Monument 
to purchase the tracts formerly owned by them, former owners who have 
filed an election to purchase lieu lands within 1 year from the date of 
publication of the notice prescribed in section 3(b)(5) of the Act, 
shall be deemed to have filed a timely application to purchase 
notwithstanding the fact that a specific tract of land has not been 
designated in said election.
    (c) Upon the expiration of 1 year from date of publication of the 
notice prescribed in section 3(b)(5) of the Act, the Superintendent 
shall prepare a complete list of all lands available from which 
selections of lieu lands may be made. The Superintendent shall also 
prepare a list of all former owners who elected to purchase lieu lands, 
numbering them consecutively without regard as to date of receipt of 
such election. The numbers shall then be placed on separate uniform 
slips of paper and placed in a bowl. The numbers will then be withdrawn 
from the bowl and a record made of the order in which they were 
withdrawn. The owner of the first number withdrawn shall be afforded the 
first opportunity to select lieu

[[Page 503]]

lands. The owners of lands represented by the following numbers will be 
afforded an opportunity to select lieu lands in the priority in which 
their numbers were drawn.
    (d) When all selections of lieu lands have been made as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, the Secretary shall determine the 
comparability of the lands originally owned and the lieu selections. If 
the lieu selections are not substantially the same value as the lands 
originally owned, the owners shall be afforded an opportunity to make 
other selections which are substantially the same value.
    (e) To determine whether the former Indian owned land and the 
selected lieu land in each case are of substantially the same value, the 
consideration paid by the United States for each tract may be accepted 
as indicative of the value of each tract at the time it was acquired. If 
information as to the price paid for any specific tract is not 
available, or if for any reason it is concluded that the consideration 
paid by the United States for the land is not acceptable evidence as to 
value for this purpose, the Secretary shall cause the tracts to be 
appraised to determine their comparability. The appraisals of lands 
shall be made on the basis of current market values. The lands shall be 
considered to be substantially the same value if the differences in 
values do not exceed 10 percent of the greater value.


<R05>
Sec. 178.9  Lands formerly held subject to restrictions against alienation.

    Former Indian owners who held title to the lands which were acquired 
for the gunnery range subject to restrictions against alienation without 
the approval of the Secretary of the Interior shall be conveyed title to 
the reacquired lands in a trust status in the same manner as though they 
had held trust title to the lands taken.

<R05>
Sec. 179.4  Distribution of principal and income.

    In all cases where the document creating the life estate does not

regulations are applicable to lands or interests in lands the title to 
which is held in trust by the United States or is subject to a 
restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. These 
regulations are intended to ensure that Indian mineral owners desiring 
to have their resources developed are assured that they will be 
developed in a manner that maximizes their best economic interests and 
minimizes any adverse environmental impacts or cultural impacts 
resulting from such development.
    (b) The regulations in this part shall be subject to amendment at 
any time by the Secretary of the Interior. No regulation that becomes 
effective after the date of approval of any lease or permit shall 
operate to affect the duration of the lease or permit, rate of royalty, 
rental, or acreage unless agreed to by all parties to the lease or 
permit.
    (c) The regulations of the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of 
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Minerals Management 
Service that are referenced in Secs. 211.4, 211.5, and 211.6 are 
supplemental to the regulations in this part, and apply to parties 
holding leases or permits for development of Indian mineral resources 
unless specifically stated otherwise in this part or in such other 
Federal regulations.
    (d) Nothing in the regulations in this part is intended to prevent 
Indian tribes from exercising their lawful governmental authority to 
regulate the conduct of persons, businesses, operations or mining within 
their territorial jurisdiction.
    (e) The regulations in this part do not apply to leasing and 
development governed by regulations in 25 CFR Parts 213 (Members of the 
Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma), 226 (Osage), or 227 (Wind River 
Reservation).

                    Subpart B--How to Acquire Leases


<R05>
Sec. 211.20  Leasing procedures.

    (a) Indian mineral owners may, with the approval of the 
superintendent or area director, lease their land for mining purposes. 
No oil and gas lease shall be approved unless it has first been offered 
for bidding at an advertised lease sale in accordance with this section. 
Leases for minerals other than oil and gas shall be advertised for bids 
as prescribed in this section unless the Secretary grants the Indian 
mineral owners written permission to negotiate for lease. Application 
for leases shall be made to the superintendent having jurisdiction over 
the lands.
    (b) Indian mineral owners may request that the Secretary prepare and 
advertise or negotiate (if the requirements of this section have been 
met) mineral leases on their behalf. If requested by an applicant 
interested in acquiring rights to Indian-owned minerals, the Secretary 
shall promptly notify the Indian mineral owner, and advise the owner in 
writing of the alternatives available, including the right to decline to 
lease. If the Indian mineral owner decides to have the leases 
advertised, the Secretary shall consult with the Indian mineral owner 
concerning the appropriate royalty rate and rental. The Secretary may 
then undertake the responsibility to advertise and lease in accordance 
with the following procedures:
    (1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for 
bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of 
both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one 
local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days 
in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the 
reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific 
description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific 
description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the 
superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of 
the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to 
each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. 
Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements of 
lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate 
superintendent or area director for future reference.
    (2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to the responsible 
bidder offering the highest bonus. The Secretary, after consultation 
with the Indian mineral owner, shall establish the rental and royalty 
rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and shall not be 
subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the 
Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that 
acceptance of the lease bid by the Indian mineral owner is required.

[[Page 512]]

    (3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, 
payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not 
less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that 
bid is not accepted.
    (4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) 
working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.
    (5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after 
notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the 
bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of 
the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and 
file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall 
also file the lease in completed form at that time. However, for good 
reasons, the Secretary may grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day 
increments for filing of the lease and all required bonds, provided that 
additional extension requests are submitted and approved prior to the 
expiration of the original thirty (30) days or the previously granted 
extension. Failure on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable 
actions necessary to comply with the foregoing shall result in 
forfeiture of the required payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for 
the use and benefit of the Indian mineral owner.
    (6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder 
fails to complete all requirements necessary for the approval of the 
lease, or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best 
interest of the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the 
Secretary may re-advertise the lease for sale, or, subject to the 
consent of the Indian mineral owner, the lease may be let through 
private negotiations.
    (c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the 
results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the 
consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained.
    (d) The Indian mineral owner may also submit negotiated leases to 
the Secretary for review and approval.
Sec. 211.21  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 211.22  Leases for subsurface storage of oil or gas.

    (a) The Secretary, with the consent of the Indian mineral owners, 
may approve storage leases, or modifications, amendments, or extensions 
of existing leases, on Indian lands to provide for the subsurface 
storage of oil or gas, irrespective of the lands from which production 
is initially obtained. The storage lease, or modification, amendment, or 
extension to an existing lease, shall provide for the payment of such 
storage fee or rental on such oil or gas as may be determined adequate 
in each case, or, in lieu thereof, for a royalty other than that 
prescribed in the oil and gas lease when such stored oil and gas is 
produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously produced.
    (b) The Secretary, with consent of the Indian mineral owners, may 
approve a provision in an oil and gas lease under which storage of oil 
and gas is authorized, for continuance of the lease at least for the 
period of such storage use and so long thereafter as oil or gas not 
previously produced is produced in paying quantities.
    (c) Applications for subsurface storage of oil or gas shall be filed 
in triplicate with the authorized officer and shall disclose the 
ownership of the lands involved, the parties in interest, the storage 
fee, rental, or royalty offered to be paid for such storage, and all 
essential information showing the necessity for such project. Enough 
copies of the final agreement signed by the Indian mineral owners and 
other parties in interest shall be submitted for the approval of the 
Secretary to permit retention of five copies by the Department after 
approval.

the discretion of the Secretary.
    (c) An operator may file a $150,000 bond for full nationwide 
coverage to cover all geothermal or oil and gas leases, permits, or 
assignments without geographic or acreage limitation to which the 
operator is or may become a party. Nationwide bonds are subject to 
approval in the discretion of the Secretary.
    (d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by:
    (1) Certificate of deposit issued by a financial institution, the 
deposits of which are federally insured, explicitly granting the 
Secretary full authority to demand immediate payment in case of default 
in the performance of the provisions and conditions of the lease or

Sec. 211.26  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 211.27  Duration of leases.

    (a) All leases shall be for a term not to exceed a primary term of 
lease duration of ten (10) years and, absent specific lease provisions 
to the contrary, shall continue as long thereafter as the minerals

lessee or the lessee's designee has commenced actual drilling by 
midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease with a 
drilling rig designed to reach the total proposed depth, and drilling is 
continued with reasonable diligence until the well is completed to 
production or abandoned. However, in no case shall such drilling hold 
the lease longer than 120 days past the primary term of lease duration 
without actual production of oil, gas, or geothermal resources. 
Provided, that this extension does not allow a lease to continue past 
the 10-year statutory limitation. Drilling which meets the requirements 
of this section and occurs within a unit or communitization agreement to 
which the lease is committed shall be considered as if it occurs on the 
leasehold itself. If there is a conflict between the commencement clause 
and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement clause will 
control.
    (c) A solid minerals lease which stipulates that it shall continue 
in full force and effect beyond the expiration of the primary term of 
lease duration if mining operations have commenced during the primary 
term (commencement clause), shall be valid and hold the lease beyond the 
primary term of lease duration if the lessee or the lessee's designee 
has by midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease 
commenced actual removal of mineral materials intended for sale and upon 
which royalties will be paid. If there is a conflict between the 
commencement clause and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement 
clause will control.

Sec. 211.28  Unitization and communitization agreements, and well spacing.

    (a) For the purpose of promoting conservation and efficient 
utilization of minerals, the Secretary may approve a cooperative unit, 
drilling or other development plan on any leased area upon a 
determination that approval is advisable and in the best interest of the 
Indian mineral owner. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative 
unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the 
development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single 
unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the 
agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, 
unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of 
agreements that allocate costs and benefits.
    (b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or 
cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is 
specifically required in the lease. However, the Secretary shall consult 
with the Indian mineral owner prior to making a determination concerning 
a cooperative agreement or well spacing plan.
    (c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply 
with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be 
filed with the superintendent or area director.
    (d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the 
mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be 
notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the 
superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating 
that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the 
superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice 
requirement.
    (e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and 
all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the 
superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the 
first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area proposed 
to be covered by the cooperative agreement.
    (f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval 
of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by 
the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first 
production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved 
before the lease expiration date.
    (g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement 
shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands 
committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be 
effective on the date the agreement is effective.
    (h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program 
approved by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 211.29  Exemption of leases and permits made by organized tribes.

    The regulations in this part may be superseded by the provisions of 
any tribal constitution, bylaw or charter issued pursuant to the Indian 
Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 461-479), 
the Alaska Act of May 1, 1936 (49 Stat. 1250; 48 U.S.C. 362,258a), or 
the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1967; 25 
U.S.C., and Sup., 501-509), or by ordinance, resolution, or other action 
authorized under such constitution, bylaw or charter; Provided, that 
such tribal law may not supersede the requirements of Federal statutes 
applicable to Indian mineral leases. The regulations in this part, in so 
far as they are not so superseded, shall apply to leases and permits 
made by organized tribes if the validity of the lease or permit depends 
upon the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

<R05>
Sec. 211.40  Manner of payments.

    Unless otherwise specifically provided for in a lease, once 
production has been established, all payments shall be made to the MMS 
or such other party as may be designated, and shall be made at such time 
as provided in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. Prior to 
production, all bonus and rental payments, shall be made to the 
superintendent or area director.

[[Page 516]]


<R05>
Sec. 211.41  Rentals and production royalty on oil and gas leases.

    (a) A lessee shall pay, in advance, beginning with the effective 
date of the lease, an annual rental of $2.00 per acre or fraction of an 
acre or such other greater amount as prescribed in the lease. This 
rental shall not be credited against production royalty nor shall the 
rental be prorated or refunded because of surrender or cancellation.
    (b) The Secretary shall not approve leases with a royalty rate less 
than 16-\2/3\ percent of the amount or value of production produced and 
sold from the lease unless a lower royalty rate is agreed to by the 
Indian mineral owner and is found to be in the best interest of the 
Indian mineral owner. Such approval may only be granted by the area 
director if the approving official is the superintendent and by the 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs if the approving official is the 
area director.
    (c) Value of lease production for royalty purposes shall be 
determined in accordance with applicable lease provisions and 
regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. If the valuation 
provisions in the lease are inconsistent with the regulations in 30 CFR 
chapter II, subchapters A and C, the lease provisions shall govern.
    (d) If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's 
requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then 
the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for any desired 
school or other buildings belonging to the tribe, by making his own 
connections to a regulator installed, connected to the well and 
maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay 
royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's 
risk at all times.


<R05>
Sec. 211.42  Annual rentals and expenditures for development on leases other than oil and gas, and geothermal resources.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, a lease for 
minerals other than oil, gas and geothermal resources shall provide for 
a yearly development expenditure of not less than $20 per acre. All such 
leases shall provide for a rental payment of not less than $2.00 for 
each acre or fraction of an acre payable on or before the first day of 
each lease year.
    (b) Within twenty (20) days after the lease year, an itemized 
statement, in duplicate, of the expenditure for development under a 
lease for minerals other than oil and gas shall be filed with the 
superintendent or area director. The lessee must certify the statement 
under oath.


<R05>
Sec. 211.43  Royalty rates for minerals other than oil and gas.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the minimum 
rates for leases of minerals other than oil and gas shall be as follows:
    (1) For substances other than coal, the royalty rate shall be 10 
percent of the value of production produced and sold from the lease at 
the nearest shipping point.
    (2) For coal to be strip or open pit mined the royalty rate shall be 
12\1/2\ percent of the value of production produced and sold from the 
lease, and for coal removed from an underground mine, the royalty rate 
shall be 8 percent of the value of production produced and sold from the 
lease.
    (3) For geothermal resources, the royalty rate shall be 10 percent 
of the amount or value of steam, or any other form of heat or energy 
derived from production of geothermal resources under the lease and sold 
or utilized by the lessee. In addition, the royalty rate shall be 5 
percent of the value of any byproduct derived from production of 
geothermal resources under the lease and sold or utilized or reasonably 
susceptible of sale or utilization by the lessee, except that the 
royalty for any mineral byproduct shall be governed by the appropriate 
paragraph of this section.
    (b) A lower royalty rate shall be allowed if it is determined to be 
in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. Approval of a lower 
rate may only be granted by the area director if the approving official 
is the superintendent or by the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, 
if the approving official is the area director.

[[Page 517]]


<R05>
Sec. 211.44  Suspension of operations.

    (a) After the expiration of the primary term of the lease the 
Secretary may approve suspension of operations for remedial purposes 
which are necessary for continued production, to protect the resource, 
the environment, or for other good reasons. Provided, that such remedial 
operations are conducted in accordance with 43 CFR part 3160, subpart 
3165 and under such stipulations and conditions as may be prescribed by 
the Secretary and are conducted with reasonable diligence. Any 
suspension shall not relieve the lessee from liability for the payment 
of rental and other payments as required by lease provisions.
    (b) An application for permission to suspend operations or 
production for economic or marketing reasons on a lease capable of 
production after the expiration of the primary term of lease duration 
must be accompanied by the written consent of the Indian mineral owner, 
an economic analysis, and an executed amendment by the parties to the 
lease setting forth the provisions pertaining to the suspension of 
operations and production. Such application shall be treated as a 
negotiated change to lease provisions, and as such, shall be subject to 
review and approval by the Secretary.
Sec. 211.45  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 211.46  Inspection of premises, books and accounts.

    Lessees shall allow the Indian mineral owner, the Indian mineral 
owner's representatives, or any authorized representative of the 
Secretary to enter all parts of the leased premises for the purpose of 
inspection and audit. Lessees shall keep a full and correct account of 
all operations and submit all related reports required by the lease and 
applicable regulations. Books and records shall be available for 
inspection during regular business hours.


<R05>
Sec. 211.47  Diligence, drainage and prevention of waste.

    The lessee shall:
    (a) Exercise diligence in mining, drilling and operating wells on 
the leased lands while minerals production can be secured in paying 
quantities;
    (b) Protect the lease from drainage (if oil and gas or geothermal 
resources are being drained from the lease premises by a well or wells 
located on lands not included in the lease, the Secretary reserves the 
right to impose reasonable and equitable terms and conditions to protect 
the interest of the Indian mineral owner of the lands, such as payment 
of compensatory royalty for the drainage);
    (c) Carry on operations in a good and workmanlike manner in 
accordance with approved methods and practices;
    (d) Have due regard for the prevention of waste of oil or gas or 
other minerals, the entrance of water through wells drilled by the 
lessee to other strata, to the destruction or injury of the oil or gas, 
other mineral deposits, or fresh water aquifers, the preservation and 
conservation of the property for future productive operations, and the 
health and safety of workmen and employees;
    (e) Securely plug all wells and effectively shut off all water from 
the oil or gas-bearing strata before abandoning them;
    (f) Not construct any well pad location within 200 feet of any 
structures or improvements without the Indian surface owner's written 
consent;
    (g) Carry out, at the lessee's expense, all reasonable orders and 
requirements of the authorized officer relative to prevention of waste;
    (h) Bury all pipelines crossing tillable lands below plow depth 
unless other arrangements are made with the Indian surface owner; and
    (i) Pay the Indian surface owner all damages, including damages to 
crops, buildings, and other improvements of the Indian surface owner 
occasioned by the lessee's operations as determined by the 
superintendent.


<R05>
Sec. 211.48  Permission to start operations.

    (a) No exploration, drilling, or mining operations are permitted on 
any Indian lands before the Secretary has granted written approval of a 
mineral lease or permit pursuant to the regulations in this part.
    (b) After a lease or permit is approved, written permission must be 
secured from the Secretary before any

[[Page 518]]

operations are started on the leased premises, in accordance with 
applicable rules and regulations in 25 CFR part 216; 30 CFR chapter II, 
subchapters A and C; 30 CFR part 750 (Requirements for Surface Coal 
Mining and Reclamation Operations on Indian Lands), 43 CFR parts 3160, 
3260, 3480, 3590, and Orders or Notices to Lessees (NTLs) issued 
thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 211.49  Restrictions on operations.

    Leases issued under the provisions of the regulations in this part 
shall be subject to such restrictions as to time or times for well 
operations and production from any leased premises as the Secretary 
judges may be necessary or proper for the protection of the natural 
resources of the leased land and in the interest of the lessor.
Sec. 211.50  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 211.51  Surrender of leases.

    A lessee may, with the approval of the Secretary, surrender a lease 
or any part of it, on the following conditions:
    (a) All royalties and rentals due on the date the request for 
surrender is received must be paid;
    (b) The superintendent, after consultation with the authorized 
officer, must be satisfied that proper provisions have been made for the 
conservation and protection of the property, and that all operations on 
the portion of the lease surrendered have been properly reclaimed, 
abandoned, or conditioned, as required;
    (c) If a lease has been recorded, the lessee must submit a release 
along with the recording information of the original lease so that, 
after acceptance of the release, it may be recorded;
    (d) If a lessee requests to surrender an entire lease or an entire 
undivided portion of a lease document, the lessee must deliver to the 
superintendent or area director the original lease documents; Provided, 
that where the request is made by an assignee to whom no copy of the 
lease was delivered, the assignee must deliver to the superintendent or 
area director only its copy of the assignment;
    (e) If the lease (or a portion thereof being surrendered) is owned 
in undivided interests, all lessees owning undivided interests in the 
lease must join in the request for surrender;
    (f) No part of any advance rental shall be refunded to the lessee, 
nor shall any subsequent surrender or termination of a lease relieve the 
lessee of the obligation to pay advance rental if advance rental became 
due prior to the date the request for surrender was received by the 
superintendent or area director;
    (g) If oil, gas, or geothermal resources are being drained from the 
leased premises by a well or wells located on lands not included in the 
lease, the Secretary reserves the right, prior to acceptance of the 
surrender, to impose reasonable and equitable terms and conditions to 
protect the interests of the Indian mineral owners of the lands 
surrendered. Such terms and conditions may include payment of 
compensatory royalty for any drainage; and
    (h) Upon expiration or surrender of a solid mineral lease the lessee 
shall deliver the leased premises in a condition conforming to the 
approved reclamation plan. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, the 
machinery necessary to operate the mine is the property of the lessee. 
However, the machinery may not be removed from the leased premises 
without the written permission of the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 211.52  Fees.

    Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each permit, lease, 
sublease, or other contract, or assignment, thereof shall be accompanied 
by a filing fee of $75.00 at the time of filing.


<R05>
Sec. 211.53  Assignments, overriding royalties, and operating agreements.

    (a) Approved leases or any interest therein may be assigned or 
transferred only with the approval of the Secretary. The Indian mineral 
owner must also consent if approval of the Indian mineral owner is 
required in the lease. If consent is not required, then the Secretary 
shall notify the Indian mineral owner of the proposed assignment. To 
obtain the approval of the Secretary the assignee must be qualified to 
hold the lease under existing rules and regulations and shall furnish a 
satisfactory bond conditioned for the

[[Page 519]]

faithful performance of the covenants and conditions of the lease.
    (b) No lease or interest therein or the use of such lease shall be 
assigned, sublet, or transferred, directly or indirectly, by working or 
drilling contract, or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary.
    (c) Assignments of leases, and stipulations modifying the provisions 
of existing leases, which stipulations are also subject to the approval 
of the Secretary, shall be filed with the superintendent within five (5) 
working days after the date of execution. Upon execution of satisfactory 
bonds by the assignee the Secretary may permit the release of any bonds 
executed by the assignor. Upon execution of satisfactory bonds the 
assignee accepts all the assignor's responsibilities and prior 
obligations and liabilities of the assignor (including but not limited 
to any underpaid royalties and rentals) under the lease.
    (d) Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of 
production shall not be considered as interests in the leases as such 
provision is used in this section. Agreements creating overriding 
royalties or payments out of production, or agreements designating 
operators are hereby authorized and the approval of the Secretary shall 
not be required with respect thereto, but such agreements shall be 
subject to the condition that nothing in such agreements shall be 
construed as modifying any of the obligations of the lessee, including, 
but not limited to, obligations imposed by requirements of the MMS for 
reporting, accounting, and auditing; obligations for diligent 
development and operation, protection against drainage and mining in 
trespass, compliance with oil and gas, geothermal, and mining 
regulations (25 CFR part 216; 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, and 3590; 
and those applicable rules found in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and 
C) and the requirements for Secretarial approval before abandonment of 
any oil and gas or geothermal well or mining operation. All such 
obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free 
of any such overriding royalties or payments. The existence of 
agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, 
whether or not actually paid, shall not be considered as justification 
for the approval of abandonment of any oil and gas or geothermal well or 
mining operation. Nothing in this paragraph revokes the requirement for 
approval of assignments and other instruments which is required in this 
section, but any overriding royalties or payments out of production 
created by the provisions of such assignments or instruments shall be 
subject to the condition stated in this section. Agreements creating 
overriding royalties or payments out of production, or agreements 
designating operators shall be filed with the superintendent unless 
incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed pursuant 
to this section.


<R05>
Sec. 211.54  Lease or permit cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs notice of noncompliance.

    (a) If the Secretary determines that a permittee or lessee has 
failed to comply with the terms of the permit or lease; the regulations 
in this part; or other applicable laws or regulations; the Secretary 
may:
    (1) Serve a notice of noncompliance specifying in what respect the 
permittee or lessee has failed to comply with the requirements 
referenced in this paragraph, and specifying what actions, if any, must 
be taken to correct the noncompliance; or
    (2) Serve a notice of proposed cancellation of the lease or permit. 
The notice of proposed cancellation shall set forth the reasons why 
lease or permit cancellation is proposed and shall specify what actions, 
if any, must be taken to avoid cancellation.
    (b) The notice of noncompliance or proposed cancellation shall 
specify in what respect the permittee or lessee has failed to comply 
with the requirements referenced in paragraph (a), and shall specify 
what actions, if any, must be taken to correct the noncompliance.
    (c) The notice shall be served upon the permittee or lessee by 
delivery in person or by certified mail to the permittee or lessee at 
the permittee's or lessee's last known address. When certified mail is 
used, the date of service shall be deemed to be when the notice is 
received or five (5) working days

[[Page 520]]

after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (d) The lessee or permittee shall have thirty (30) days (or such 
longer time as specified in the notice) from the date that the notice is 
served to respond, in writing, to the official or the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs office that issued the notice.
    (e) If a permittee or lessee fails to take any action that is 
prescribed in the notice of proposed cancellation, fails to file a 
timely written response to the notice, or files a written response that 
does not, in the discretion of the Secretary, adequately justify the 
permittee's or lessee's actions, then the Secretary may cancel the lease 
or permit, specifying the basis for the cancellation.
    (f) If a permittee or lessee fails to take corrective action or to 
file a timely written response adequately justifying the permittee's or 
lessee's actions pursuant to a notice of noncompliance, the Secretary 
may issue an order of cessation of operations. If the permittee or 
lessee fails to comply with the order of cessation, or fails to timely 
file an appeal of the order of cessation pursuant to paragraph (h), the 
Secretary may issue an order of lease or permit cancellation.
    (g) Cancellation of a lease or permit shall not relieve the lessee 
or permittee of any continuing obligations under the lease or permit.
    (h) Orders of cessation or of lease or permit cancellation issued 
pursuant to this section may be appealed under 25 CFR part 2.
    (i) This section does not limit any other remedies of the Indian 
mineral owner as set forth in the lease or permit.
    (j) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of 
the authorized officer or the MMS official to take any enforcement 
action authorized pursuant to statute or regulation.
    (k) The authorized officer, MMS official, and the superintendent 
and/or area director should consult with one another before taking any 
enforcement actions.


<R05>
Sec. 211.55  Penalties.

    (a) In addition to or in lieu of cancellation under Sec. 211.54, 
violations of the terms and conditions of any lease, or the regulations 
in this part, or failure to comply with a notice of noncompliance or a 
cessation order issued by the Secretary, or, in the case of solid 
minerals the authorized officer, may subject a lessee or permittee to a 
penalty of not more than $1,000 per day for each day that such a 
violation or noncompliance continues beyond the time limits prescribed 
for corrective action.
    (b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the lessee or 
permittee either personally or by certified mail to the lessee or 
permittee at the lessee's or permittee's last known address. The date of 
service by certified mail shall be deemed to be the date when received 
or five (5) working days after the date mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the 
proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the lessee or permittee 
of the lessee's or permittee's right to either request a hearing within 
thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. 
Hearings shall be held before the superintendent and/or area director 
whose findings shall be conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant 
to 25 CFR part 2.
    (d) If the lessee or permittee served with a notice of proposed 
penalty requests a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the 
violations or noncompliance set forth in the notice continue beyond the 
time limits prescribed for corrective action. The Secretary may issue a 
written suspension of the requirement to correct the violations pending 
completion of the hearings provided by this section only upon a 
determination, at the discretion of the Secretary, that such a 
suspension will not be detrimental to the lessor and upon submission and 
acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss 
or damage. The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost 
of correcting the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed 
amounts plus accrued penalties and interest.
    (e) Payment in full of penalties more than ten (10) days after a 
final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the

[[Page 521]]

lessee or permittee to late payment charges. Late payment charges shall 
be calculated on the basis of a percentage assessment rate of the amount 
unpaid per month for each month or fraction thereof until payment is 
received by the Secretary. In the absence of a specific lease provision 
prescribing a different rate, the interest rate on late payments and 
underpayments shall be a rate applicable under Sec. 6621(a)(2) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the 
amount of payment not received and only for the number of days the 
payment is late.
    (f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:
    (1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the 
authorized officer, the director's representative or the MMS official to 
impose penalties for violations of applicable regulations pursuant to 43 
CFR part 3160, and 43 CFR Groups 3400 and 3500, 30 CFR part 750, or 30 
CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C;
    (2) Replacing or superseding any penalty provision in the terms and 
conditions of a lease or permit approved by the Secretary pursuant to 
this part; or
    (3) Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of lease 
or permit terms for which the authorized officer, director's 
representative or MMS official, have either statutory or regulatory 
authority to assess a penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 211.56  Geological and geophysical permits.

    Permits to conduct geological and geophysical operations on Indian 
lands which do not conflict with any mineral leases entered into 
pursuant to this part, may be approved by the Secretary with the consent 
of the Indian mineral owner under the following conditions:
    (a) The permit must describe the area to be explored, the duration, 
and the consideration to be paid the Indian owner;
    (b) The permit will not grant the permittee any option or preference 
rights to a lease or other development contract, or authorize the 
production of, or removal of oil and gas, geothermal resources, or other 
minerals, except samples for assay and experimental purposes, unless 
specifically so stated in the permit; and
    (c) Copies of all data collected pursuant to operations conducted 
under the permit shall be forwarded to the Secretary and the Indian 
mineral owner, unless otherwise provided in the permit. Data collected 
under a permit may be held by the Secretary as privileged and 
proprietary information for the time prescribed in the permit. Where no 
time period is prescribed in the permit, the Secretary may release such 
information after six (6) years, with the consent of the Indian mineral 
owner.


<R05>
Sec. 211.57  Forms.

    Leases, bonds, permits, assignments, and other instruments relating 
to mineral leasing shall be on forms, prescribed by the Secretary, that 
may be obtained from the superintendent or area director. The provisions 
of a standard lease or permit may be changed, deleted, or added to by 
written agreement of all parties with the approval of the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 211.58  Appeals.

    Appeals from decisions of Bureau of Indian Affairs officers under 
this part may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2.

Sec. 212.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part govern leases for the development 
of individual Indian oil and gas, geothermal and solid mineral 
resources. These regulations are applicable to lands or interests in 
lands the title to which is held, for any individual Indian, in trust by 
the United States or is subject to restriction against alienation 
imposed by the United States. These regulations are intended to ensure 
that Indian mineral owners desiring to have their resources developed 
are assured that they will be developed in a manner that maximizes their 
best economic interests and minimizes any adverse environmental impacts 
or cultural impacts resulting from such development.
    (b) The regulations in this part shall be subject to amendment at 
any time by the Secretary of the Interior. No regulation that becomes 
effective after the date of approval of any lease or permit shall 
operate to affect the duration of the lease or permit, rate of royalty, 
rental, or acreage unless agreed to by all parties to the lease or 
permit.
    (c) Nothing in the regulations in this part is intended to prevent 
Indian tribes from exercising their lawful governmental authority to 
regulate the conduct of persons, businesses, operations or mining within 
their territorial jurisdiction.
    (d) The regulations of the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of 
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Minerals Management 
Service that are referenced in Secs. 212.4, 212.5, and 212.6 of this 
part are supplemental to these regulations, and apply to parties holding 
leases or permits for development of Indian mineral resources unless 
specifically stated otherwise in this part or in such other Federal 
regulations.
    (e) The regulations in this part do not apply to leasing and 
development governed by regulations in 25 CFR part 213 (Members of the 
Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma), 226 (Osage), or 227 (Wind River 
Reservation).

<R04>
                    Subpart B--How to Acquire Leases


<R05>
Sec. 212.20  Leasing procedures.

    (a) Application for leases shall be made to the superintendent 
having jurisdiction over the lands.
    (b) Indian mineral owners may request the Secretary to prepare, 
advertise and negotiate mineral leases on their behalf. Leases for 
minerals shall be advertised for bids as prescribed in this section 
unless one or more of the Indian mineral owners of a tract sought for 
lease request the Secretary to negotiate for a lease on their behalf 
without advertising. Unless the Secretary decides that negotiation of a 
mineral lease is in the best interests of the Indian mineral owners, he 
shall use the following procedure for leasing:
    (1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for 
bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of 
both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one 
local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days 
in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the 
reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific 
description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific 
description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the 
superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of 
the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to 
each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. 
Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements on 
lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate 
agency or area office for future reference.
    (2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to a responsible bidder 
offering the highest bonus. The Secretary shall establish the rental and 
royalty rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and will not be 
subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the 
Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that 
acceptance of the lease bid by or on behalf of the Indian mineral owner 
is required. The requirements under Sec. 212.21 are applicable to the 
acceptance of a lease bid.
    (3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, 
payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not 
less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that 
bid is not accepted.
    (4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) 
working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.
    (5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after 
notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the 
bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of 
the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and 
file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall 
also file the lease in completed form, signed by the Indian mineral 
owner(s), at that time. However, for good reasons, the Secretary may 
grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day increments for filing of the 
lease and all required bonds, provided that additional extension 
requests are submitted and approved prior to the expiration of the 
original thirty (30) days or the previously granted extension. Failure 
on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable actions necessary to 
comply with the foregoing shall result in forfeiture of the required 
payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for the use and benefit of the 
Indian mineral owner.
    (6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder 
fails to complete all requirements necessary for approval of the lease, 
or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best interest of 
the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the Secretary may re-
advertise the tract for sale, or subject to the consent of the Indian 
mineral owner, a lease may be let through private negotiations.

[[Page 526]]

    (c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the 
results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the 
consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained. The requirements 
under Sec. 212.21 are applicable to the approval of a mineral lease.


<R05>
Sec. 212.21  Execution of leases.

    (a) The Secretary shall not execute a mineral lease on behalf of an 
Indian mineral owner, except when such owner is deceased and the heirs 
to or devisee of the estate have not been determined, or if determined, 
some or all of them cannot be located. Leases involving such interests 
may be executed by the Secretary, provided that the mineral interest 
shall have been offered for sale under the provisions of section 
212.20(b) (1) through (6).
    (b) The Secretary may execute leases on behalf of minors and persons 
who are incompetent by reason of mental incapacity; Provided, that there 
is no parent, guardian, conservator, or other person who has lawful 
authority to execute a lease on behalf of the minor or person with 
mental incapacity.
    (c) If an owner is a life tenant, the procedures set forth in 25 CFR 
part 179 (Life Estates and Future Interests), shall apply.

<R05>
Sec. 212.28  Unitization and communitization agreements, and well spacing.

    (a) For the purpose of promoting conservation and efficient 
utilization of minerals, the Secretary may approve a cooperative unit, 
drilling or other development plan on any leased area upon a 
determination that approval is advisable and in the best interest of the 
Indian mineral owner. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative 
unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the 
development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single 
unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the 
agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, 
unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of 
agreements that allocate costs and benefits.
    (b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or 
cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is 
specifically required in the lease.
    (c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply 
with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be 
filed with the superintendent or area director.
    (d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the 
mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be 
notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the 
superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating 
that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the 
superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice 
requirement.
    (e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and 
all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the 
superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the 
first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area

[[Page 527]]

proposed to be covered by the cooperative agreement.
    (f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval 
of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by 
the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first 
production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved 
before the lease expiration date.
    (g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement 
shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands 
committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be 
effective on the date the agreement is effective.
    (h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program 
approved by the authorized officer.
Sec. 212.29  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 212.30  Removal of restrictions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any mineral lease to the 
contrary, the removal of all restrictions against alienation shall 
operate to divest the Secretary of all supervisory authority and 
responsibility with respect to the lease. Thereafter, all payments 
required to be made under the lease shall be made directly to the 
owner(s).
    (b) In the event restrictions are removed from a part of the land 
included in any lease approved by the Secretary, the entire lease shall 
continue to be subject to the supervision of the Secretary until such 
times as the holder of the lease and the unrestricted Indian owner 
submits to the Secretary satisfactory evidence that adequate 
arrangements have been made to account for the mineral resources of the 
restricted land separately from those of the unrestricted. Thereafter, 
the unrestricted portion shall be relieved from the supervision of the 
Secretary, the lease, the regulations of this part, and all other 
applicable laws and regulations.
Secs. 212.31-212.32  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 212.33  Terms applying after relinquishment.

    All leases for individual Indian lands approved by the Secretary 
under this part shall contain provisions for the relinquishment of 
supervision and provide for operations of the lease after such 
relinquishment. These leases shall contain provisions that address the 
following issues:
    (a) Provisions of relinquishment. If the Secretary relinquishes 
supervision at any time during the life of the lease instrument as to 
all or part of the acreage subject to the lease, the Secretary shall 
give the Indian mineral owner and the lessee thirty (30) days written 
notice prior to the termination of supervision. After notice of 
relinquishment has been given to the lessee, the lease shall be subject 
to the following conditions:
    (1) All rentals and royalties thereafter accruing shall be paid 
directly to the lessor or the lessor's successors in title, or to a 
trustee appointed under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) If, at the time supervision is relinquished by the Secretary, 
the lessee has made all payments then due and has fully performed all 
obligations on the lessee's part to be performed up to the time of such 
relinquishment, the bond given to secure the performance of the lease, 
on file in the appropriate agency or area office, shall be of no further 
force or effect.
    (3) Should relinquishment affect only part of the lease, then the 
lessee may continue to conduct operations on the land covered by the 
lease as an entirety; Provided, that the lessee shall pay, in the manner 
prescribed by the lease and regulations for the benefit of lessor, the 
same proportion of all rentals and royalties due under the provisions of 
this part as the acreage retained under the supervision of the Secretary 
bears to the entire acreage of the lessee, and shall pay the remainder 
of the rentals and royalties directly to the remaining lessors or 
successors in title or said trustee as the case may be, as provided in 
paragraph (a) (1) of this section.
    (b) Division of fee. If, after the execution of the lease and after 
the Secretary relinquishes supervision thereof, the fee of the leased 
land is divided into separate parcels held by different

[[Page 528]]

owners, or if the rental or royalty interest is divided in ownership, 
the obligations of the lessee shall not be modified in any manner except 
as specifically provided by the provisions of the lease. Notwithstanding 
such separate ownership, the lessee may continue to conduct operations 
on said premises as an entirety. Each separate owner shall receive such 
proportion of all rental and royalties accruing after the vesting of its 
title as the acreage of the fee, or rental or royalty interest, bears to 
the entire acreage covered by the lease; or to the entire rental or 
royalty interest as the case may be. If at any time after departmental 
supervision of the lease is relinquished, in whole or in part, to 
rentals and royalties, whether said parties are so entitled by virtue of 
undivided interest or by virtue of ownership of separate parcels of the 
land covered, the lessee may elect to withhold the payment of further 
rentals or royalties (except as the portion due the Indian lessor while 
under restriction), until all of said parties shall agree upon and 
designate a trustee in writing and in a recordable instrument to receive 
all payments due thereunder on behalf of said parties and their 
respective successors in title. Payments to said trustee shall 
constitute lawful payments, and the sole risk of an improper or unlawful 
distribution of said funds by said trustee shall rest upon the parties 
naming said trustee and their said respective successors in title.


<R05>
Sec. 212.34  Individual tribal assignments excluded.

    (a) A lessee shall pay, in advance, beginning with the effective 
date of the lease, an annual rental of $2.00 per acre or fraction of an 
acre or such other greater amount as prescribed in the lease. This 
rental shall not be credited against production royalty nor shall the 
rental be prorated or refunded because of surrender or cancellation.
    (b) The Secretary shall not approve leases with a royalty rate less 
than 16-\2/3\ percent of the amount or value of production produced and 
sold from the lease unless a lower royalty rate is agreed to by the 
Indian mineral owner and is found to be in the best interest of the 
Indian mineral owner. Such approval may only be granted by the area 
director if the approving official is the superintendent and the 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs if the approving official is the 
area director.
    (c) Value of lease production for royalty purposes shall be 
determined in accordance with applicable lease provisions and 
regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. If the valuation 
provisions in the lease are inconsistent with the regulations in 30 CFR 
chapter II, subchapters A and C, the lease provisions shall govern.

of the Indian owner under the following conditions:
    (1) The permit must describe the area to be explored, the duration 
and the consideration to be paid the Indian owner;
    (2) The permit may not grant the permittee any option or preference 
rights to a lease or other development contract, authorize the 
production of, or removal of oil and gas, or geothermal resources, or 
other minerals except samples for assay and experimental purposes, 
unless specifically so stated in the permit; and
    (3) Copies of all data collected pursuant to operations conducted 
under the permit shall be forwarded to the Secretary and made available 
to the Indian mineral owner, unless otherwise provided in the permit. 
Data collected under a permit shall be held by the Secretary as 
privileged and proprietary information for the time prescribed in the 
permit. Where no time period is prescribed in the permit, the Secretary 
may, in the discretion of the Secretary, release such information after 
six (6) years.
    (b) A permit may be granted by the Secretary without 100 percent 
consent of the individual mineral owners if:
    (1) The minerals are owned by more than one person, and the owners 
of a majority of the interest therein consent to the permit;
    (2) The whereabouts of one or more owners of the minerals or an 
interest therein is unknown, and all the remaining owners of the 
interests consent to the permit;
    (3) The heirs or devisee of a deceased owner of the land or an 
interest therein have not been determined, and the Secretary finds that 
the permit activity will cause no substantial injury to the land or any 
owner thereof; or
    (4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the 
Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain their consent, and 
also finds that the permit activity will cause no substantial injury to 
the land or any owner thereof.
    (c) A lessee does not need a permit to conduct geological and 
geophysical operations on Indian lands, if provided for

[[Page 530]]

in the lessee's mineral lease, where the Indian mineral owner is also 
the surface land owner. In instances where the Indian mineral owner is 
not the surface owner, the lessee must obtain any additional necessary 
permits or rights of ingress or egress from the surface occupant.

Sec. 213.1  Definitions.

    Area Director. The term ``Area Director'' in this part refers to the 
officer in charge of the Five Civilized Tribes Indian Agency.
    Supervisor. The term ``supervisor'' in this part refers to a 
representative of

[[Page 531]]

the Secretary of the Interior under direction of the Director of the 
U.S. Geological Survey, authorized and empowered to supervise and direct 
operations under oil and gas or other mining leases, to furnish 
scientific and technical information and advice, to ascertain and record 
the amount and value of production, and to determine and record rentals 
and royalties due and paid.

                          How To Acquire Leases


<R05>
Sec. 213.2  Applications for leases.

    Applications for leases should be made to the Area Director.


<R05>
Sec. 213.3  No Government employee shall acquire leases.

    No lease, assignment thereof, or interest therein will be approved 
to any employee or employees of the U.S. Government, whether connected 
with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or otherwise, and no employee of the 
Department of the Interior shall be permitted to acquire any interest in 
such leases covering restricted Indian lands by ownership of stock in 
corporations having leases or in any other manner.

(R.S. 2078; 25 U.S.C. 68)


<R05>
Sec. 213.4  Sale of oil and gas leases.

    (a) At such times and in such manner as he may deem appropriate, the 
Area Director shall publish notices at least thirty days prior to the 
sale, unless a shorter period is authorized by the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs, that oil and gas leases on specific tracts, each of 
which shall be in a reasonably compact body, will be offered to the 
highest responsible bidder for a bonus consideration, in addition to 
stipulated rentals and royalties. Each bid must be accompanied by a 
cashier's check, certified check, or postal money order, payable to the 
payee designated in the invitation to bid, in an amount not less than 25 
percent of the bonus bid. Within 30 days after notification of being the 
successful bidder, said bidder must remit the balance of the bonus, the 
first year's rental, and his share of the advertising costs, and shall 
file with the Area Director the lease in completed form. The Area 
Director may, for good and sufficient reasons, extend the time for the 
completion and submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be 
granted for remitting the balance of monies due. If the successful 
bidder fails to pay the full consideration within said period, or fails 
to file the completed lease within said period or extension thereof, or 
if the lease is disapproved through no fault of the lessor or the 
Department of the Interior, 25 percent of the bonus bid will be 
forfeited for the use and benefit of the Indian lessor.
    (b) In cases where any part of the bonus bid for a lease is paid 
directly to the Indian lessor, upon his signing the lease, the lessee 
must procure and file with the lease an affidavit of the lessor, sworn 
to before a U.S. Commissioner, Postmaster, Area Director, local 
representative of the Area Director, county or district judge, Federal 
judge or clerk of a Federal court, showing the amount of bonus so paid, 
and the balance thereof must be paid into the office of the Area 
Director upon filing the lease. Where possible lessees are requested to 
take the lessor to the nearest United States field clerk who will render 
all proper assistance in the execution of leases, and before whom the 
bonus affidavit may be executed in cases where any part of bonus 
consideration is paid directly to the lessor. Where leases are executed 
by guardians, under order of court, the affidavit of lessor may be 
executed before a notary public.
    (c) All notices or advertisements of sales of oil and gas leases 
shall reserve to the Secretary of the Interior the right to reject all 
bids when in his judgment the interests of the Indians will be best 
served by so doing, and that if no satisfactory bid is received, or if 
the accepted bidder fails to complete the lease or if the Secretary of 
the Interior shall determine that it is unwise in the interests of the 
Indians to accept the highest bid, the Secretary may readvertise such 
lease for sale, or if deemed advisable, with the consent of the Indian 
owners, a lease may be made by private negotiations. The successful 
bidder or bidders will be required to pay his or their share of the 
advertising costs. Amounts received from unsuccessful bidders will be 
returned; but when no bid is accepted on

[[Page 532]]

a tract, the costs of advertising will be assessed against the applicant 
who requested that said tract be advertised.

<R05>
Sec. 213.5  Term of oil and gas leases.

    Oil and gas mining leases which require the approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior may be made for periods of 10 years from the 
date of approval of lease by the Secretary of the Interior and as much 
longer thereafter as oil and/or gas is produced in paying quantities.


<R05>
Sec. 213.6  Leases for minerals other than oil and gas.

    Uncontested mining leases for minerals other than oil and gas shall 
be made on forms \1\ prescribed by the Department, for a period of 15 
years with the right of renewal on such terms as the superintendent may 
prescribe, and shall be subject only to approval by the Area Director. 
See provisions of the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 408). Any 
persons aggrieved by any decision or order of the Area Director 
approving, rejecting, or disapproving any such lease may appeal from the 
same to the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days from the date of 
such decision or order.

Sec. 213.8  Filing of lease deemed constructive notice.

    The filing of any lease in the office of the Area Director shall be

(such as field clerk, postmaster, U.S. Commissioner, etc.).


<R05>
Sec. 213.11  Minor lessors.

    Where the lessor is a minor, certified copies of letters of 
guardianship and court orders approving leases must be filed.


<R05>
Sec. 213.12  Leases executed by guardians of minors.

    Leases executed by guardians of minors under order of court for a 
period extending beyond the minority of the minor will be approved 
unless it appears that such action would be prejudicial to the interests 
of the minor: Provided, That in the event the minor becomes of age 
within 1 year from the date of execution of lease the consent of the 
minor to the execution of the lease should be obtained and submitted 
with the lease for consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 213.13  Inherited lands.

    Except to prevent loss or waste, leases on undivided inherited lands 
will not be approved until the heirship determination has been approved. 
If the heirs to undivided inherited lands are undetermined or cannot be 
located, or if the heirs owning less than one-half interest in the lands 
refuse to sign a lease and it appears necessary to lease the lands to 
prevent loss or waste, the Area Director will report the facts to the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs and ask for instructions. Minor heirs can 
lease or joint adult heirs in leasing only through guardians under order 
of court. Proof of heirship shall be given upon Form F prescribed. If 
probate or other court proceedings have established the heirship in any 
case, or the land has been partitioned, certified copy of final order, 
judgment, or decree of the court will be accepted in lieu of Form F.

[[Page 533]]


<R05>
Sec. 213.14  Corporations and corporate information.

    If the applicant for a lease is a corporation, it shall file 
evidence of authority of its officers to execute papers; and with its 
first application it shall also file a certified copy of its articles of 
incorporation, and, if foreign to the State in which the lands are 
located, evidence showing compliance with the corporation laws thereof. 
Statements of changes in officers and stockholders shall be furnished by 
a corporation lessee to the Area Director January 1 of each year, and at 
such other times as may be requested.
    Whenever deemed advisable in any case the Area Director may require 
a corporation applicant or lessee to file:

post office addresses and numbers of shares held by each.
    (b) A sworn statement of the proper officer showing:
    (1) The total number of shares of the capital stock actually issued 
and the amount of cash paid into the treasury on each share sold; or, if 
paid in property, the kind of quantity and value of the same paid per 
share.
    (2) Of the stock sold, how much remains unpaid and subject to 
assessment.
    (3) The amount of cash the company has in its treasury and 
elsewhere.

statement, application for registration, prospectus or offering sheet 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities 
Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or said Commission's

said acts or rules and regulations; and what disposition of any such 
statement, application, prospectus or offering sheet has been made.
    (c) Affidavits of individual stockholders, setting forth in what 
corporations, or with what persons, firms, or associations such

Commission, see 17 CFR chapter II.


<R05>
Sec. 213.15  Bonds.

    (a) Lessee shall furnish with each mining lease a bond (Form 5-
154b), and an assignee of a lease shall furnish with each assignment a 
bond (Form 5-154m), with an acceptable company authorized to act as sole 
surety, or with two or more personal sureties and a deposit as 
collateral security of any public-debt obligations of the United States 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, equal to 
the full amount of such bonds, or other collateral satisfactory to the 
Secretary of the Interior, or show ownership of unencumbered real estate 
of the value equal to twice the amount of the bonds. Lessee may file a 
bond on Form 5-154a without sureties and a deposit as collateral 
security of Government bonds equal in value to the full amount of the 
bond. Lease bonds, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
shall not be less than the following amounts:

For less than 80 acres............................................$l,000
For 80 acres and less than 120 acres...............................1,500

    Provided, That for leases for minerals other than oil and gas the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative with the 
consent of the Indian landowner may authorize a bond for a lesser amount 
if, in his opinion, the circumstances warrant and the interests of the 
Indian landowners are fully protected: Provided further, That a lessee 
may file a bond (Form 5-154f), in the sum of $15,000 for all leases of 
minerals up to 10,240 acres under the jurisdiction of the officer in 
charge of the Five Civilized Tribe Agency.
    (b) In lieu of the bonds required under paragraph (a) of this 
section, a lessee may furnish a bond (Form 5-156) in the sum of $75,000 
for full nationwide coverage with an acceptable company

[[Page 534]]

authorized to act as sole surety to cover all oil and gas leases and oil 
and gas prospecting permits without geographic or acreage limitation to 
which the lessee or permittee is or may become a party.
    (c) The right is specifically reserved to increase the amount of 
bonds and the collateral security prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section in any particular case when the officer in charge deems it 
proper to do so. The nationwide bond may be increased at any time in the 
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.

                           Rents and Royalties


<R05>
Sec. 213.18  Manner of payment of rents and royalties.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all rents, 
royalties and other payments due under leases which have been or may be 
approved in accordance with this part shall be paid by check or bank 
draft to the order of the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to 
the Area Director for deposit to the credit of the various lessors. When 
lessees and purchasers are instructed, in writing, by the Area Director, 
which instructions shall be complete as to lessors for each lease, 
separate remittances for each payment due each lessor shall be mailed to 
the Area Director. Any payments under this paragraph, covering lands or 
interests therein from which restrictions have been removed by death or 
otherwise, may continue to be made in the manner provided by this 
paragraph until ten days after notice of relinquishment of supervision 
has been mailed to the lessee.
    (b) The Area Director may, in his discretion, whenever it appears to 
be in the best interest of any lessor, authorize and direct the lessee 
to pay directly to the lessor, or to the legal guardian of any lessor 
under guardianship, the rents, royalties and other payments (other than 
bonuses and advance payments for the first year) due under leases which 
have been or may be approved in accordance with the regulations in this 
part. Any such authority for direct payment shall be in writing, 
addressed to the owner or owners of the lease, and shall expressly 
provide for its revocation or modification at any time, in writing, by 
the Area Director. Written authorization for direct payment and written 
revocations or modifications thereof shall become a part of the lease 
and shall be distributed as in the case of original leases. All such 
revocations or modifications shall have a 5-day grace period after date 
of receipt. Rents, royalties, and other payments paid in accordance 
therewith shall constitute full compliance with the requirements of the 
lease pertaining to such payments.
    (c) Rents and royalties paid pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section on producing leases shall be supported by statements, 
acceptable to the Secretary or his duly authorized representative, to be 
transmitted to the Supervisor, in duplicate, covering each lease, 
identified by contract number and lease number. Such statements shall 
show the specific items of rents or royalties for which remittances are 
made, and shall identify each remittance by the remittance number, date, 
amount, and name of each payee.
    (d) Rents paid on nonproducing leases pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of

[[Page 535]]

this section shall be supported by a statement, acceptable to the Area 
Director, to be transmitted to the Area Director covering each lease, 
identified by contract number and lease number. Each remittance shall be 
identified by the remittance number, date, amount, name of each payee, 
and dates of mailing of remittances. Date of mailing, or, if remittance 
is sent by registered mail, the date of registration receipts covering 
remittances mailed, shall be considered as date of payment.
    (e) For leases other than oil and gas, all advance rentals and 
royalties for the first year shall be paid to the Area Director at the 
time of filing the lease, and the advance royalty and 20 percent of the 
first year's rental so paid shall be and become the property of the 
lessor, if the lease be disapproved because of the lessee's failure to 
meet the requirements of the law or of the regulations in this part or 
because of any other fault or defect chargeable to the lessee.


<R05>
Sec. 213.19  Crediting advance annual payments.

    In the event of discovery of minerals, all advance rents and advance 
royalties shall be allowed as credit on stipulated royalties for the 
year for which such advance payments have been made. No refund of such 
advance payments made under any lease will be allowed in the event the 
royalty on production is not sufficient to equal such advance payment; 
nor will any part of the moneys so paid be refunded to the lessee 
because of any subsequent surrender or cancellation of the lease.
Sec. 213.20  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 213.21  Rate of rents on leases other than oil and gas.

    On all mineral leases of allotted lands other than oil and gas 
leases, rental shall be paid annually in advance from the date of 
approval of the lease, as follows: Fifty cents per acre for the first 
year, 75 cents per acre for the second year, and $1 per acre for the 
third and each succeeding year of the term of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 213.22  Expenditures under lease other than oil and gas.

    (a) On all leases for deposits of minerals other than oil and gas, 
there shall be expended for each calendar year the lease is in force, 
and for each fraction of a calendar year greater than 6 months, in 
actual mining operations, development, or improvements upon the lands 
leased, or for the benefit thereof, a sum which, with the annual rental, 
shall amount to not less than $5 per acre.
    (b) The expenditures for development required by this section upon 
application may be waived in writing by the Area Director or other 
officer in charge of the Five Civilized Tribes Agency either before or 
after the approval of a lease, such waiver to be subject to termination 
at any time upon 10 days' written notice to the holder of the lease by 
the said Area Director or other officer in charge.
    (c) Each lessee, except oil and gas lessees, shall file with the 
Area Director an itemized statement in duplicate, within 20 days after 
the close of each calendar year, of the amount and character of said 
expenditures during such years the statement to be certified under oath 
by the lessee or his agent having personal knowledge of the facts 
contained therein.


<R05>

tungsten, coal, asphaltum and allied substances, oil, and gas, the 
lessee shall pay quarterly or as otherwise provided in the lease, a 
royalty of not less than 10 percent of the value, at the nearest 
shipping point, of all ores, metals, or minerals marketed.

deducting forwarding charges to the point of sale; and for copper, lead, 
zinc, and tungsten, a royalty of not less than 10 percent to be

[[Page 536]]

computed on the value of ores and concentrates as shown by reduction 
returns after deducting freight charges to the point of sale. Duplicate 
returns shall be filed by the lessee with the Area Director within 10 
days after the ending of the quarter or other period specified in the 
lease within which such returns are made: Provided, however, That the 
lessee shall pay a royalty of not less than 10 percent of the value of 
the ore or concentrates sold at the mine unless otherwise provided in 
the lease.
    (c) For coal the lessee shall pay quarterly or as otherwise provided 
in the lease, a royalty of not less than 10 cents per ton of 2,000

royalty of 12\1/2\ percent of the value or amount of all oil, gas and/or 
natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and 
saved from the land leased, save and except oil and/or gas used by the 
lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease, which oil or 
gas shall be royalty free. A higher rate of royalty may be fixed by the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, prior to the 
advertisement of land for oil and gas leases. During the period of 
supervision, ``value'' for the purposes of the lease may, in the 
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior be calculated on the basis 
of the highest price paid or offered (whether calculated on the basis of 
short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion 
of the oil of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or 
all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold from the field where 
the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable 
product less the content of foreign substances as determined by the 
supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the sale of 
said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, 
be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of such value. When 
paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly at such 
time as the lease provides; when royalty on oil produced is paid in 
kind, such royalty oil shall be delivered in tanks provided by the 
lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless 
otherwise agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be 
required by the lessor. The lessee shall not be required to hold such 
royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar 
month in which said oil is produced. The lessee shall be in no manner 
responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil in 
storage by causes beyond his control.


<R05>
Sec. 213.25  Free use of gas by lessor.

    If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's 
requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then 
the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for all stoves and 
inside lights in the principal dwelling house on said premises, by 
making his own connections to a regulator, connected to the well and 
maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay 
royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's 
risk at all times.


<R05>
Sec. 213.26  Rate of royalty on casing-head gas.

    (a) On casing-head gas used or sold for the manufacture of casing-
head gasoline the minimum rate of royalty shall be 12\1/2\ percent of 
the value of the casing-head gas, which value shall be determined and 
computed on the basis and in the manner provided in the applicable 
operating regulations of the Department.
    (b) In cases where gas produced and sold has a value for drip 
gasoline, casing-head gasoline content, and as dry

[[Page 537]]

gas from which the casing-head gasoline has been extracted, then the 
royalties above provided shall be paid on all such values.


<R05>
Sec. 213.27   Rate of rental for nonutilized gas wells.

    If the gas from a gas producing well is not marketed or utilized, 
other than for operation of the lease, then for each such well the 
lessee shall pay such rental as may be determined by the supervisor and 
approved by the Secretary of the Interior, calculated from the date of 
the completion of the well. Payment of annual gas rentals shall be made 
within 30 days from the date such payment becomes due.


<R05>
Sec. 213.28  Royalty payments and production reports.

    (a) Royalty payments on all oil and gas or other producing leases 
shall be made at the rates, and at such time, and in the manner 
prescribed by the terms of the lease.
    (b) Quarterly reports shall be made by each lessee on nonproducing 
leases other than oil and gas within 25 days after December 31, March 
31, June 30, and September 30, of each year, upon forms provided, 
showing manner of operations and total production during such quarter. A 
lessee may include within one sworn statement all leases upon which 
there is no production or upon which dry holes have been drilled. 
Reports of oil and gas leases where royalty accounting is done in the 
field office of the supervisor will be made as required in the operating 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 213.29  Division orders.

    (a) Lessees may make arrangements with the purchasers of oil and gas 
for the payment of the royalties as provided for in the lease and the 
regulations but such arrangement, if made, shall not operate to relieve 
a lessee from responsibility should the purchaser fail or refuse to pay 
royalties when due. Where lessees avail themselves of this privilege, 
division orders should be executed by the lessee and forwarded to the 
supervisor for approval. Purchasers may be authorized by the supervisor 
to reimburse lessees out of royalties for advance rents and advance 
royalties. Copies of written instructions, notices, modifications, 
revocations, and authorizations, as provided for in Sec. 213.18 (a) and 
(b), shall be furnished to purchasers. The right is reserved for the 
supervisor to cancel a division order at any time or require the 
purchaser to discontinue to run the oil of any lessee who fails to 
operate the lease properly or otherwise violates the provisions of the 
lease, of the regulations in this part, or of the operating regulations.
    (b) When oil is taken by authority of a division order, the lessee 
or his representatives shall be actually present when the oil is gauged 
and records are made of the temperature, gravity, and impurities. The 
lessee will be held responsible for the correctness and the correct 
recording and reporting of all the foregoing measurements, which, except 
lowest gauge, shall be made at the time the oil is turned into the 
pipeline. Failure of the lessee to perform properly these duties will 
subject the division order to revocation.

                               Operations


<R05>
Sec. 213.30  Permission to start operations.

    No operations will be permitted on any lease before it is approved. 
Written permission must be secured from the supervisor before any 
operations are started under any oil and gas lease. Operations must be 
in accordance with the operating regulations promulgated by the 
Secretary of the Interior. Copies of these regulations may be secured 
from either the supervisor or the Area Director and no operations should 
be attempted without a study of the operating regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 213.31  Restrictions on operations.

    (a) Oil and gas leases issued under the provisions of this part 
shall be subject to imposition by the Secretary of the Interior of such 
restrictions as to time or times for the drilling of wells and as to the 
production from any well or wells as in his judgment may be necessary or 
proper for the protection of the natural resources of the leased land 
and in the interest of the lessor. In the exercise of his judgment the 
Secretary of the Interior may take into consideration, among other 
things, the Federal

[[Page 538]]

laws, State laws, regulations by competent Federal or State authorities, 
lawful agreements among operators regulating either drilling or 
production, or both.
    (b) All such leases shall be subject to any cooperative or unit plan 
of development affecting the leased lands that may be required by the 
Secretary of the Interior, but no lease shall be included in any 
cooperative or unit plan without prior approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior. If said plan effects a change in the lease terms, the consent 
of the lessor or lessors must be obtained before the plan is effective.


<R05>
Sec. 213.32  Wells.

    The lessee shall agree (a) to drill and produce all wells necessary 
to offset or protect the leased land from drainage by wells on adjoining 
lands not the property of the lessor, or in lieu thereof, compensate the 
lessor in full each month for the estimated loss of royalty through 
drainage: Provided, That during the period of supervision by the 
Secretary of the Interior, the necessity for offset wells shall be 
determined by the supervisor and payment in lieu of drilling and 
producing shall be with the consent of, and in an amount determined by 
the Secretary of the Interior; (b) at the election of the lessee to 
drill and produce other wells: Provided, That the right to drill and 
produce such other wells shall be subject to any system of well spacing 
or production allotments authorized and approved under applicable law or 
regulations, approved by the Secretary of the Interior and affecting the 
field or area in which the leased lands are situated; and (c) if the 
lessee elects not to drill and produce such other wells for any period 
the Secretary of the Interior may, within 10 days after due notice in 
writing, either require the drilling and production of such wells to the 
number necessary, in his opinion, to insure reasonable diligence in the 
development and operation of the property, or may in lieu of such 
additional diligent drilling and production require the payment on and 
after the first anniversary date of the lease of not to exceed $1 per 
acre per annum, which sum shalI be in addition to any rental or royalty 
herein specified.


<R05>
Sec. 213.33  Diligence and prevention of waste.

    The lessee shall exercise diligence in drilling and operating wells 
for oil and gas on the leased lands while such products can be secured 
in paying quantities; carry on all operations in a good and workmanlike 
manner in accordance with approved methods and practice, having due 
regard for the prevention of waste of oil or gas developed on the land, 
or the entrance of water through wells drilled by the lessee to the 
productive sands or oil or gas-bearing strata to the destruction or 
injury of the oil or gas deposits, the preservation and conservation of 
the property for future productive operations, and to the health and 
safety of workmen and employees; plug securely all wells before 
abandoning the same and to shut off effectually all water from the oil 
or gas-bearing strata; not drill any well within 200 feet of any house 
or barn on the premises without the lessor's written consent approved by 
the Area Director; carry out at his expense all reasonable orders and 
requirements of the supervisor relative to prevention of waste, and 
preservation of the property and the health and safety of workmen; bury 
all pipelines crossing tillable lands below plow depth unless other 
arrangements therefor are made with the Area Director; pay the lessor 
all damages to crops, buildings, and other improvements of the lessor 
occasioned by the lessee's operations: Provided, That the lessee shall 
not be held responsible for delays or casualties occasioned by causes 
beyond his control.


<R05>
Sec. 213.34  Inspection of premises; books and accounts.

    Lessees shall agree to allow the lessors and their agents or any 
authorized representative of the Interior Department to enter, from time 
to time, upon and into all parts of the leased premises for the purpose 
of inspection, and shall further agree to keep a full and correct 
account of all operations and make reports thereof, as required by the 
applicable regulations of the Department; and their books and records, 
showing manner of operations and persons interested, shall be open at 
all times for examination by such officers

[[Page 539]]

of the Department as shall be instructed in writing by the Secretary of 
the Interior or authorized by regulations to make such examination.


<R05>
Sec. 213.35  Mines to be timbered properly.

    In mining operations the lessee shall keep the mine well and 
sufficiently timbered at all points where necessary, in accordance with 
good mining practice, and in such manner as may be necessary to the 
proper preservation of the property leased and safety of workmen.


<R05>
Sec. 213.36  Surrender of leased premises in good condition.

    On expiration of the term of a lease, or when a lease is 
surrendered, the lessee shall deliver to the Government the leased 
ground, with the mine workings in case of leases other than oil and gas, 
in good order and condition, and the bondsmen will be held for such 
delivery in good order and condition, unless relieved by the Secretary 
of the Interior for cause. It shall, however, be stipulated that the 
machinery necessary to operate any mine is the property of the lessee, 
but that it may be removed by him only after the condition of the 
property has been ascertained by inspection by the Secretary of the 
Interior or his authorized agents, to be in satisfactory condition.


<R05>
Sec. 213.37  Penalties.

    Failure of the lessee to comply with any provisions of the lease, of 
the operating regulations, of the regulations in this part, orders of 
the Area Director or his representative, or of the orders of the 
supervisor or his representative, shall subject the lease to 
cancellation by the Secretary of the Interior or the lessee to a penalty 
of not more than $500 per day for each day the terms of the lease, the 
regulations, or such orders are violated, or to both such penalty and 
cancellation: Provided, That the lessee shall be entitled to notice and 
hearing, within 30 days after such notice, with respect to the terms of 
the lease, regulations, or orders violated, which hearing shall be held 
by the supervisor, whose findings shall be conclusive unless an appeal 
be taken to the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days after notice of 
the supervisor's decision, and the decision of the Secretary of the 
Interior upon appeal shall be conclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 213.38  Assignments and overriding royalties.

    (a) Leases or any interest therein, may be assigned or transferred 
only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and to procure 
such approval the assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under 
existing rules and regulations, and shall furnish a satisfactory bond 
for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof. No 
lease or any interest therein, or the use of such lease, shall be 
assigned, sublet, or transferred, directly or indirectly, by working or 
drilling contract, or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary of 
the Interior. Assignments of leases shall be filed with the Area 
Director within 20 days after the date of execution.
    (b) An agreement creating overriding royalties or payments out of 
production on oil and gas leases under this part shall be subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 211.26(d) of this subchapter, or as hereafter 
amended.

Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 213.39  Stipulations.

    The lessee under any lease heretofore approved may by stipulation 
(Form 5-154i) with the consent of the lessor and the approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior, make such approved lease subject to all the

regulations currently in use. Stipulations shall be filed with the Area 
Director within 20 days after the date of execution.


<R05>
Sec. 213.40  Cancellations.

    (a) When, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior, the 
lessee has violated any of the terms and conditions of a lease or of the 
applicable regulations, or if mining operations are conducted wastefully 
and without regard to good mining practice, the Secretary of the 
Interior shall have the right at any time after 30 days' notice to the 
lessee specifying the terms and

[[Page 540]]

conditions violated, and after a hearing, if the lessee shall so request 
within 30 days after issuance of the notice, to declare such lease null 
and void, and the lessor shall then be entitled and authorized to take 
immediate possession of the land.
    (b) On the following conditions, the lessee may, on approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior, surrender a lease or any part of it:
    (1) That he make application for cancellation to the Area Director 
having jurisdiction over the land.
    (2) That he pay a surrender fee of $1 at the time the application is 
made.
    (3) That he pay all royalties and rentals due to the date of such 
application.
    (4) That he make a satisfactory showing that full provision has been 
made for conservation and protection of the property and that all wells, 
drilled on the portion of the lease surrendered, have been properly 
abandoned.
    (5) If the lease has been recorded, that he file, with his 
application, a recorded release of the acreage covered by the 
application.
    (6) If the application is for the cancellation of the entire lease 
or the entire undivided portion, that he surrender the lease: Provided, 
That where the application is made by an assignee to whom no copy of the 
lease was delivered, he will be required to surrender only his copy of 
assignment.
    (7) If the lease (or portion being surrendered or canceled) is owned 
in undivided interests by more than one party, then all parties shall 
join in the application for cancellation.
    (8) That all required fees and papers must be in the mail or 
received on or before the date upon which rents and royalties become 
due, in order for the lessee and his surety to be relieved from 
liability for the payment of such royalties and rentals.
    (9) If there has been a contest respecting a lease or leases, the 
approved, the disapproved, or the canceled parts thereof will be held in 
the office of the Area Director for 5 days after the Department's 
decision has been promulgated, by mail or delivery, and will not be 
delivered, if within that period a motion for review and reconsideration 
be filed, until such motion is passed upon by the Department.
    (10) In the event oil or gas is being drained from the leased 
premises by wells not covered by a lease; the lease, or any part of it,

of the Interior may determine to be reasonable and equitable.
    (c) No part of any advance rental shall be refunded to the lessee 
nor shall he be relieved, by reason of any subsequent surrender or 
cancellation of the lease, from the obligation to pay said advance 
rental when it becomes due.

                         Removal of Restrictions


<R05>
Sec. 213.41  Leases executed but not approved before restrictions removed from land.

    Leases executed before the removal of restrictions against 
alienation on land from all of which restrictions against alienation 
shall be removed after such execution, if such leases contain specific 
provisions for approval by the Secretary of the Interior, whether now 
filed with the Department or presented for consideration hereafter, will 
be considered and acted upon by this Department as heretofore but only 
for the purpose of approving or disapproving the instrument.


<R05>
Sec. 213.42  Operations after removal of restrictions from leased lands.

    (a) Oil and gas leases heretofore approved and leases for other 
minerals now or hereafter in force on land from all of which 
restrictions against alienation have been or shall be removed, even if 
such leases contain provision authorizing supervision by this 
Department, shall after such removal of restrictions against alienation, 
be operated entirely free from such supervision, and the authority and 
power delegated to the Secretary of the Interior in said leases shall 
cease and all payments required to be made to the Area Director shall 
thereafter be made to the lessor or the then owner of the land, and 
changes in regulations thereafter made by the Secretary of the Interior 
shall not apply to such leased

[[Page 541]]

land from which said restrictions are removed.
    (b) In the event restrictions are removed from a part of the land 
included in any lease to which this section applies the entire lease 
shall continue subject to the supervision of the Secretary of the 
Interior, and all royalties thereunder shall be paid to the Area 
Director until such time as the lessor and lessee shall furnish the 
Secretary of the Interior satisfactory information that adequate 
arrangements have been made to account for the oil, gas or mineral upon 
the restricted land separately from that upon the unrestricted. 
Thereafter the restricted land only shall be subject to the supervision 
of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That the unrestricted 
portion shall be relieved from such supervision as in the lease or 
regulations provided.


<R05>
Sec. 213.43  Relinquishment of Government supervision.

    All oil and gas leases hereafter executed shall contain the 
following relinquishment of supervision clause and terms operative after 
such relinquishment, or other provisions similar in substance:

    Relinquishment of supervision by the Secretary of the Interior.--
Should the Secretary of the Interior, at any time during the life of 
this instrument, relinquish supervision as to all or part of the acreage 
covered hereby, such relinquishment shall not bind lessee until said 
Secretary shall have given 30 days' written notice. Until said 
requirements are fulfilled, lessee shall continue to make all payments 
due hereunder as heretofore in section 3(c). After notice of 
relinquishment has been received by lessee, as herein provided this 
lease shall be subject to the following further conditions:
    (a) All rentals and royalties thereafter accruing shall be paid in 
the following manner: Rentals and royalties shall be paid to lessor or 
his successors in title, or to a trustee appointed under the provision 
of section 9 hereof. Rentals and royalties shall be paid directly to 
lessor, his successors in title, or to said trustee as the case may be.
    (b) If, at the time supervision is relinquished by the Secretary of 
the Interior, lessee shall have made all payments then due hereunder, 
and shall have fully performed all obligations on its part to be 
performed up to the time of such relinquishment, then the bond given to 
secure the performance hereof, on file in the Indian Office, shall be of 
no further force or effect.
    (c) Should such relinquishment affect only part of the acreage, then 
lessee may continue to drill and operate the land covered hereby as an 
entirety: Provided, That lessee shall pay in the manner prescribed by 
section 3(c), for the benefit of lessor such proportion of all rentals 
and royalties due hereunder as the acreage retained under the 
supervision of the Secretary of the Interior bears to the entire acreage 
of the lease, the remainder of such rentals and royalties to be paid 
directly to lessor or his successors in title or said trustee as the 
case may be, as provided in subdivision (a) of this section.
    Division of fee. It is covenanted and agreed that should the fee of 
said land be divided into separate parcels, held by different owners, or 
should the rental or royalty interests hereunder be so divided in 
ownership, after the execution of this lease and after the Secretary of 
the Interior relinquishes supervision hereof, the obligations of lessee 
hereunder shall not be added to or changed in any manner whatsoever save 
as specifically provided by the terms of this lease. Notwithstanding 
such separate ownership, lessee may continue to drill and operate said 
premises as an entirety: Provided, That each separate owner shall 
receive such proportion of all rentals and royalties accruing after the 
vesting of his title as the acreage of the fee, or rental or royalty 
interest, bears to the entire acreage covered by the lease; or to the 
entire rental and royalty interest as the case may be: Provided further, 
That, if, at any time after departmental supervision hereof is 
relinquished, in whole or in part, there shall be four or more parties 
entitled to rentals or royalties hereunder, whether said parties are so 
entitled by virtue of undivided interests or by virtue of ownership of 
separate parcels of the land covered hereby, lessee at his election may 
withhold the payment of further rentals or royalties (except as to the 
portion due the Indian lessor while under restriction), until all of 
said parties shall agree upon and designate in writing and in a 
recordable instrument a trustee to receive all payments due hereunder on 
behalf of said parties and their respective successors in title. 
Payments to said trustee shall constitute lawful payments hereunder, and 
the sole risk of an improper or unlawful distribution of said funds by 
said trustee shall rest upon the parties naming said trustee and their 
respective successors in title. (The above provisions are copied from 
oil and gas mining lease Form 5-154h,\1\ revised April 24, 1935.)

<R05>
Sec. 213.44  Division of royalty to separate fee owners.

    Should the removal of restrictions affect only part of the acreage 
covered by a lease containing provisions to the effect that the 
royalties accruing under the lease, where the fee is divided into 
separate parcels, shall be paid to each owner in the proportion which 
his acreage bears to the entire acreage covered by the lease, the lessee 
or assignee of such unrestricted portion will be required to make the 
reports required by the regulations in this part and the operating 
regulations with respect to the beginning of drilling operations, 
completion of wells, and production the same as if the restrictions had 
not been removed. In the event the unrestricted portion of the leased 
premises is producing, the owner of the lease thereon will be required 
to pay the portion of the royalties due the Indian lessor at the time 
and in the manner specified by the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 213.45  Restrictions especially continued as to certain lands.

    Restricted lands allotted as either homestead or surplus allotments, 
designated as tax exempt under section 4 of the act of May 10, 1928, as 
amended May 24, 1928 (45 Stat. 495, 733), the entire interest in which 
was acquired by inheritance, gift, devise, or purchase with restricted 
funds, by persons of one-half or more Indian blood, after the passage of 
the act of January 27, 1933 (47 Stat. 777), continue to be restricted 
under the provisions of the last mentioned act and oil and gas leases 
thereof are subject to the regulations in this part and all such leases 
to be valid must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Lands 
inherited by or devised to full blood Indians prior to the act of 
January 27, 1933, are not affected as to restrictions by the provisions 
of said act and may continue to be leased with the approval of the 
county court having jurisdiction of the estate of the deceased allottee 
and without approval of the Secretary of the Interior (54 L.D. 382; 10 
F. (2d), 487). Lands acquired prior to the passage of the act of January 
27, 1933 by Indians of less than full blood, whether such lands were 
restricted and tax exempt or restricted and taxable, passed to such 
persons free of all restrictions. Inherited homesteads restricted prior 
to April 26, 1931, by section 9,\2\ of the act of May 27, 1908 (35 Stat. 
312), for the benefit of heirs of one-half or more Indian blood but less 
than full bloods, born after March 4, 1906, became unrestricted April 
26, 1931, or upon the death prior thereto of the heir born subsequent to 
March 4, 1906, and oil and gas leases thereof are not subject to the 
regulations in this part nor under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of 
the Interior.

    \2\ Repealed restrictions on inherited homesteads, by sec. 2 of the 
act of May 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 495).

<R05>
Sec. 213.46  Field clerks.

    Local representatives known officially as ``field clerks'' are 
located in the various districts comprising that part of the State of 
Oklahoma occupied by the Five Civilized Tribes. Such field clerks shall 
report to and act under the direction of the Area Director. Any and all 
counsel and advice desired by allottees concerning deeds, leases, or 
other instruments or matters relating to lands allotted to them shall be 
furnished by such field clerks free of charge. Field clerks shall not, 
during their term of employment, have any personal interest, directly or 
indirectly, in any transaction concerning leases covering lands of 
allottees or in the purchase or sale of any such lands regardless of 
whether the restrictions have or have not been removed. This 
prohibition, however, shall not apply to lands which such field clerks 
have legally acquired before their employment in the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs. Field clerks shall report to the Area Director at the end of 
each month the work performed during such period and special reports 
shall be made immediately of any apparently illegal transaction 
involving the estates or allotments of allottees.

Interior: Provided, That no regulations made after the approval of any 
lease shall operate to affect the term of the lease, rate of royalty, 
rental, or acreage unless agreed to by both parties to the lease. All 
former regulations governing the leasing of individually owned lands of 
the Five Civilized Tribes for mining purposes are superseded by the 
regulations in this part.

will be promptly refunded.


<R05>

    Provided, That for leases for minerals other than oil and gas the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representatives with the 
consent of the Indian landowner may authorize a bond for a lesser amount 
if, in his opinion, the circumstances warrant and the interests of the 
Indian landowners are fully protected: Provided further, That the lessee 
shall be allowed to file bond, Form S \1\ covering all leases to which 
he or they are or may become parties instead of a separate bond in each

<R05>
Sec. 214.5  Additional information.

    The officer in charge may, at any time, either before or after 
approval of a lease call for any additional information necessary to 
carry out the purpose and intent of the regulations in this part, and 
such information shall be furnished within the time specified in the 
request therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 214.6  Failure of lessee to complete lease.

    Should a lessee fail to furnish, within the time specified after his 
bid is accepted, the papers necessary to put his lease and bond in 
proper form for consideration, the officer in charge shall recommend 
that the sale be disapproved and money paid forfeited to the Osage 
Tribe.


<R05>
Sec. 214.7  Operation not permitted until lease approved; 160 acres maximum for single lease.

    No mining or work of any nature will be permitted upon any tract of 
land until a lease covering such tract shall have been approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior and delivered to the lessee. All leases shall 
be made for such period as the title to the minerals remain in the Osage 
Tribe, which time will expire April 8, 1931, unless otherwise provided 
by Congress and shall be subject to cancellation or termination as 
specified in this part. Leases made by corporations shall be accompanied

    (a) For deposits of the nature of lodes, or veins containing ores of 
gold, silver, copper, or other useful metals, 640 acres.
    (b) For beds of placer gold, gypsum, asphaltum, phosphate, iron 
ores, and other useful minerals, other than coal, lead, and zinc, 960 
acres.
    (c) For coal, 4,800 acres.
    (d) For lead and zinc, 1,280 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 214.9  Advance rental.

    (a) Lessees shall pay, in addition to other considerations, annual 
advance rentals as follows: 15 cents per acre for

[[Page 545]]

the first year; 30 cents per acre for the second year; 50 cents per acre 
for the third year; and $1 per acre per annum for the fourth and each 
succeeding year during the life of any lease: Provided, That all such 
payments of advance rentals shall be credits on royalties on production 
during the year for which payment of advance rental is made.
    (b) The payment of annual advance rental shall not release the 
lessee from the obligation to conduct mining operations, as required by 
the terms of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 214.10  Royalty rates.

    Royalties will be required as follows, subject to the approval of 
the President, in accordance with the act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 
543):
    (a) For gold, silver, or copper lessee shall pay quarterly a royalty 
of 10 percent to be computed on the gross value of the ores as shown by 
reduction returns after deducting freight and treatment charges. 
Duplicate reduction returns shall be filed by the lessee with the 
officer in charge within 20 days after the reduction of the ores.
    (b) For coal the lessee shall pay a royalty of 10 cents per ton of 
2,000 pounds on mine run or coal as taken from the mines, including what 
is commonly called ``slack.''
    (c) For asphaltum and allied substances, the lessee shall pay 
quarterly a royalty of 10 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds on crude 
material, and 60 cents per ton on refined substances.
    (d) For substances other than gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, 
coal, and asphaltum the lessee shall pay quarterly a royalty of 10 
percent of the value at the nearest shipping point of all ores, metals, 
or minerals marketed.
    (e) The royalties to be paid for lead and zinc shall be computed for 
each mineral at the same rate that the amount of the concentrates of 
such mineral bears to the total amount of dirt or rock actually mined, 
except as stipulated in this section. The royalty so determined shall be 
increased by adding 1 percent for each increase of $10 in the selling 
price per ton thereof over and above the following, which shall be the 
agreed base or standard:

For zinc--$50
For lead--$65

but in no case shall the rate of royalty be less than 5 percent or more 
than 20 percent. The percentage of recovery shall be computed as nearly 
as practicable upon the ore included in each sale, but where it is 
impracticable so to do the officer in charge and the lessee shall agree 
upon some other method of computation which will produce substantially 
the same result: Provided, That in case of their disagreement the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall prescribe a rule of computation to 
be followed in such cases.

    Note: The royalty would always be determined under this rule by 
ascertaining the percentage of recovery were it not for two things: (1) 
the flat rates which are fixed as the minimum and the maximum rates of 
royalty and (2) variations in the selling price of the ores. Concrete 
examples coming under the rule are set forth in the following table:

                                  Zinc                                  
               [Where the base or standard is $50 per ton]              
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Percentage of recovery       Selling price          Royalty (percent)  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
7......................           $48                        7          
14.....................            49                       14          
12.....................            50                       12          
15.....................            60                       16          
30.....................            60                       20          
9......................            70                       11          
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A similar table might be constructed for royalties on lead, but in so 
doing it would be necessary to bear in mind that the base or standard 
selling price for the lead is to be $65 instead of $50.


<R05>
Sec. 214.11  Payment of rents and royalties.

    All rentals, royalties, damages, or other amounts which may become 
due under leases approved in accordance with the regulations in this 
part shall be paid to the disbursing agent at Pawhuska, Okla. The 
remittances shall be in St. Louis exchange, except that where such 
exchanges cannot be procured post office or express money orders will be 
accepted. All royalties or other payments or claims of the Osage Tribe 
arising under such leases shall be a lien upon the mining plant 
machinery, and all minerals mined on the property leased or in which the 
lessee still retains any right, claim, or interest.

[[Page 546]]


<R05>
Sec. 214.12  Time of payment of royalties.

    Royalties on all minerals produced in any quarter (January-March, 
April-June, July-September, October-December) shall be paid on or before 
the 25th day of the month next succeeding, and the remittance shaIl be 
accompanied by sworn reports covering all operations, whether there has 
been production or not. Annual advance rentals shall be paid within 10 
days after the beginning of the lease year.


<R05>
Sec. 214.13  Diligence; annual expenditures; mining records.

    (a) Lessees shall exercise diligence in the conduct of prospecting 
and mining operations, and on all leases referred to in Sec. 214.8(a) 
shall expend annually in development work a sum which with the annual 
rental shall make an amount of not less than $5 per acre. On all leases 
referred to in Sec. 214.8 (b) and (c) there shall be expended annually 
in development work a sum which inclusive of the annual rental shall 
make an amount of not less than $1 for each acre or fraction thereof 
included in the lease. The lands covered by each lease referred to in 
Sec. 214.8 (d) shall be prospected for lead and zinc ores by drilling 
within 1 year test holes aggregating 2,000 feet unless a sufficient ore 
body is discovered to justify the sinking of a shaft to the ore body and 
the erecting of a mill when such tract may be released from further 
prospecting by the written consent of the superintendent: Provided, That 
within 90 days after an ore body of sufficient quantity is discovered, 
and shown by the logs or records of the drill holes, to justify the 
expenditure, the sinking of a shaft to the ore body, and the erection of 
a mill shall be commenced and continued to completion without cessation 
of work thereon, barring unavoidable accidents or causes beyond the 
control of the lessee.
    (b) Lessee shall keep upon the leased premises accurate records of 
the drilling, redrilling, or deepening of all holes showing the 
formations, and upon the completion of such holes, copies of such 
records shall be transmitted to the superintendent by the lessee after 
the first completion and of any further drilling thereafter, and a 
failure to so furnish report within the time prescribed shall be 
considered a violation of the regulations. Lessee shall, before 
commencing operations, file with the superintendent a plat and 
preliminary statement of how the openings are to be made and the 
property developed.


<R05>
Sec. 214.14  Use of surface lands.

    (a) Lessees may use so much of the surface of the leased land as 
shall be reasonably necessary for the prospecting and mining operations 
and buildings required by the lease, and shall also have the right-of-
way over and across such land to any point of prospecting or mining 
operations, but such use of the surface shall be permissible only under 
condition of least injury and inconvenience to the allottee or owner of 
the land. Lessees before commencing and during such operations shall pay 
all reasonable damages for the use of the surface land and to any 
growing crops thereon, or to improvements on said land, or any damage 
that during the life of the lease may be occasioned in any manner 
whatsoever by the use of the surface, to the allottee or his successor 
in interest or assignee, or to a lessee of the surface of said land or 
to an oil and gas lessee, damages to be apportioned among the parties 
interested in the surface, whether as owner, lessee, or otherwise, as 
the parties in interest may mutually agree or as their interests may 
appear. If the parties are unable to agree concerning damages the same 
shall be determined by arbitration.
    (b) All agreements (or authenticated copies thereof) providing for 
the settlement of damages shall be filed in the Osage Agency if the 
surface owner is a restricted Indian, and all such amounts which may be 
due and payable to any such Indian shall be paid to the superintendent 
and by him immediately remitted to the Indian entitled thereto. All sums 
due as royalty or damages shall be a lien on all equipment on leased 
premises.


<R05>
Sec. 214.15  Homesteads.

    Lessees and those acting under them shall not conduct prospecting or 
mining operations within or upon any homestead selection without written

[[Page 547]]

consent of the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 214.16  Settlement of damages.

    Any person, other than a lessee or an allottee or the heirs of a 
deceased allottee, claiming an interest in any leased tract or in 
damages thereto must furnish to the officer in charge a statment in 
writing showing his interest, and failure to furnish such statement 
shall constitute a waiver of notice and estop said person from claiming 
any part of such damages after the same shall have been disbursed.


<R05>
Sec. 214.17  Use of timber from restricted lands.

    Lessees will not be permitted to use any timber from any Osage lands 
not relieved of restrictions upon alienation except under written 
agreement with the owner approved by the officer in charge.


<R05>
Sec. 214.18  Assignments.

    Approved leases or any interest therein may be transferred or

regulations under which such leases were approved as well as to such 
additional requirements as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe. 
The transferee or assignee shall furnish with his transfer or assignment 
a satisfactory bond as prescribed in Sec. 214.4 in connection with 
leases. Any attempt to transfer or assign an approved lease or any 
interest therein without the consent and approval of the Secretary of 
the Interior shall be absolutely void and shall subject the original 
lease to cancellation in the discretion of the secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 214.19  Cancellation.

    When a lessee makes application for the cancellation of a lease in 
whole or in part, all royalties or rentals due up to and including the 
date of the application for cancellation must be paid, and that part of 
the lease delivered to the lessee shall be surrendered before such 
application will be considered. In the event a lease is surrendered for 
cancellation in whole or in part, after a new lease year has been 
entered upon, the lessee and his surety shall be liable for the advance 
rentals required to be paid under the lease for that year, and no part 
of such rentals which may have been paid shall be refunded.


<R05>

operations and persons interested, shall be open at all times for the 
examination of such officers of the department as shall be instructed by 
the Secretary of the Interior to make such examinations.


<R05>
Sec. 214.22  Serving of notices.

30 days' notice to show cause why such lease should not be canceled and 
annulled or other order made with reference thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 214.26  Fine; notice and hearing.

    Violation of any of the terms or conditions of any lease or of the 
regulations pertaining thereto shall subject the lease to cancellation

operations thereon shall be considered the representative of the lessee 
for the purpose of service of orders or notices as provided in this 
part, and service upon any employee, contractor, or other person shall 
be deemed service on the lessee. Wherever a notice is provided for in 
the regulations in this part or in the lease from it shall be deemed 
sufficient if notice has been mailed to the last known address of the 
lessee or his local or resident representatives, and time shall begin to 
run with the day next ensuing after the mailing, or from date of 
delivery of personal notice.


<R05>
Sec. 215.3  Manner and time of royalty payments.

    All royalties belonging to the lessor shall be paid to the 
superintendent of the Quapaw Agency at Miami, Okla., or such other 
official as the Secretary of the Interior may designate, for the benefit 
of the lessor, not later than 15 days from the 1st of each month for ore 
and concentrates sold during the preceding month.


<R05>
Sec. 215.4  Leases to be sold at public auction.

    Except as otherwise provided in the regulations in this part, no 
lead and zinc mining lease under this part of restricted or trust 
allotted and inherited Indian lands within and under the Quapaw Indian 
Agency shall be made except to the highest responsible bidder at public 
auction.


<R05>
Sec. 215.5  Royalty rates.

    (a) In leases offered for sale at public auction under the 
regulations in this part the royalty to be paid by the lessee shall be 
stipulated at a fixed percent of the gross proceeds of all lead and zinc 
ores and concentrates extracted from the leased premises, the royalty to 
be computed and based upon each sale of ore or concentrates separately, 
the rate of royalty to be determined and fixed by the Secretary of the 
Interior in the case of each lease prior to the offering of such lease 
for sale. Subject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to 
reject any and all bids, leases offered for sale at public auction shall 
be awarded in each case to the responsible bidder submitting the highest 
bonus offer.
    (b) In leases not offered for sale at public auction but otherwise 
made and entered into under the provisions of the regulations in this 
part the royalty stipulated and fixed therein shall be such as may be 
determined by the Secretary of the Interior or as may be agreed upon in 
each case, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
    (c) It shall be further provided, however, that said sale-price 
basis for the determination of the rates and amount of royalty shall not 
be less than the highest and best obtainable market price of the lead 
and zinc ores and concentrates at the usual and customary place of 
disposing of such ores and concentrates at the time of sale: Provided, 
however, That the right is reserved to the Secretary of the Interior to 
determine and declare such market price if it is deemed necessary for 
him to do so for the protection of the interests of the Indian lessor: 
And provided further, That the right is reserved to the Secretary of the 
Interior on behalf of the Indian lessors to reserve at any time it shall 
be deemed to be to the best interests of the Indian lessors and upon due 
notice to the lessee, the royalty share of the gross production of the 
ore and concentrates and upon such notice that the royalty share of such 
production shall be stored and not sold, the lessee shall be required to 
store, free of charge to the Indian lessors in the ore bins of said 
lessee, said royalty shares of the gross production of ore and 
concentrates, provided that the lessee may not be required to store ore 
or concentrates for the lessor in amounts

[[Page 551]]

greater than one-third of his bin capacity or for a period longer than 6 
months.


<R05>
Sec. 215.6  Applications for leases; consent of Indian owners.

    (a) Applications or requests by the Indian owners of restricted or 
trust land, or by others, that such land be leased or offered for lease 
for lead and zinc mining purposes should be addressed to the Secretary 
of the Interior and submitted through the superintendent of the Quapaw 
Indian Agency. Upon receipt of such applications or requests, the 
superintendent shall give consideration thereto and forward the same to 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with his report and recommendation.
    (b) In no instance will a new lease be executed and delivered (or 
advertised for sale to the highest bidder) unless the Indian owner 
thereof, if an adult who has not been specifically found by the 
Secretary of the Interior to be personally incompetent to transact 
ordinary business affairs, has agreed to the terms of said lease or the 
terms under which said lease is advertised for lease, except in cases 
where the land is owned by several co-tenants, and, in such cases, no 
such lease shall be given or advertised for sale unless the co-owners or 
a majority in interest, if adults, and not specifically declared 
incompetent, have first consented thereto: Provided, That in the event 
the majority in interest is owned by minors, or adults specifically 
found to be incompetent, then and in that event, the Secretary of the 
Interior reserves the right to lease the entire tract if, in his 
opinion, such leasing will inure to the best interest of the restricted 
Indian owners.


<R05>
Sec. 215.7  Advertisement of sale of leases.

    Upon authority being granted by the Secretary of the Interior to the 
superintendent to offer for sale at public auction a lead and zinc 
mining lease of any tract or tracts of restricted or trust allotted and 
inherited Indian lands, the superintendent shall cause a notice to be 
published once a week for at least 4 weeks in some designated newspaper 
of general circulation in the county in which the land is located, 
setting forth that upon a certain day, which shall be not less than 30 
days from the first publication of such notice and at a place to be 
named in the notice, the superintendent or other duly authorized 
representatives of the Secretary of the Interior will offer for sale at 
public auction a lead and zinc mining lease of such lands to the highest 
and best bidder, subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of the Interior, notice to be in such form as may be 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 215.8  Submission of bids.

    At the time of public auction bidders may submit their bids in 
person or by authorized agents, but in the latter case the bids must be 
accompanied by power of attorney duly executed by the real party or 
person in interest. Sealed bids may be submitted by mail or otherwise to 
the superintendent at his office at Miami, Okla., or delivered to him at 
the place set for the sale at any time prior to the hour fixed for 
offering the lease for sale. At the time and place of the public auction 
and before receiving the public bids the officer in charge shall 
announce the amounts and terms of all sealed bids received by him and 
the names of the bidders. The persons present, including those, if any, 
who may have theretofore submitted sealed bids, shall then be allowed to 
offer public bids. Bids must contain the offer of the stipulated and 
fixed royalty (see Sec. 215.5 as to royalty) and, in addition thereto, 
the offer of a bonus payable as follows: 25 percent at time of sale and 
the balance before or at time of execution of the lease contract. 
Bidders shall be required to submit with their bids a draft or certified 
check payable to the order of the superintendent covering the advance 
rental for the first year on the proposed leasehold and 25 percent of 
the amount of the bonus offered. The superintendent shall, in each case, 
determine the highest and best bid, said determination, however, to be 
subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Upon approval 
by the Secretary of the Interior of the award, the successful bidder 
shall, within 30 days from notice thereof, enter into and execute the 
lease contract in accordance with said bid and the regulations in this 
part. The

[[Page 552]]

lease so executed shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of 
the Interior and may be accepted or rejected by him when submitted for 
his approval. The right is reserved to the Secretary of the Interior, in 
the event of the rejection of such lease, to authorize and instruct the 
superintendent to accept the offer of some competitive bidder or to 
readvertise the land for lease. The report of the superintendent to the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs relative to the auction sale shall 
contain full information as to all bids received for the lease rights on 
the land. If any person or party fails or refuses to execute a lease 
after being declared the highest bidder or after being awarded such 
lease, the amount tendered with his bid shall be forfeited to the 
superintendent for the benefit of the owner of the land.


<R05>
Sec. 215.9  Execution of leases.

    Whenever a lease award to a proposed lessee has been approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior, as provided in Secs. 215.7 and 215.8, the 
lease contract shall be executed by the Indian owner of the land, if he 
be an adult and not incompetent as defined in Sec. 215.0(c). Before any 
lease is entered into by the Indian owners or is approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior, all the adult and competent owners or co-
owners of the tract of land which it is proposed to lease, shall be 
furnished by the Bureau such geological reports as may be available or 
that can be secured from the representative of the Geological Survey 
showing the estimated mineral reserves on said property, the estimated 
reasonable value of such property for mining purposes, and such other 
data as might reasonably be necessary to fully advise the owners of said 
property of the then present status and mining value of their lands. If 
the Quapaw or other Indian owner of the land is a minor, or is otherwise 
an incompetent as defined in the regulations in this part, the lease 
contract shall be executed by the superintendent for and on behalf of 
such minor or such incompetent. The leases executed, either by the 
Indian owner of the land or by the superintendent in his behalf, shall 
be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall be 
effective only upon such approval.

<R05>
Sec. 215.10  Renewal of leases on developed lands.

    (a) In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased, and lead 
and zinc ores have been discovered hereon, and it shall appear to the 
Secretary of the Interior to be advisable and to the best interests of 
the Indian owners of the lands that the terms of the existing lease or 
leases be extended or that a new lease or leases for an additional 
period of time, or that a new lease or leases to take effect upon the 
expiration of present valid leases, should, upon application therefor, 
be granted to either the present lessees or to parties holding under 
assignments, subleases, or mining contracts, from such present lessees, 
or to parties who have expended capital in lead and zinc mining 
operation and development of the land under such leases, assignments, 
subleases, or mining contracts, a new lease or leases or contract of 
extension or existing lease or leases as may be authorized by the 
Secretary of the Interior may be entered into with the proper party or 
parties as may be determined by said Secretary of the Interior, and such 
new lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases 
shall be executed subject to the regulations in this part by and between 
the Indian owner of the land, if an adult and not incompetent as defined 
in Sec. 215.0 (c), and said proper party or parties. If the Quapaw or 
other Indian owner of the land is a minor or an otherwise incompetent as 
defined in Sec. 215.0 (c), the superintendent shall execute the new 
lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases for 
and on behalf of said Indian minor or incompetent. Said new leases or 
contracts of extension of old leases, whether executed by the Indian 
owner of the land or by the superintendent for and in his behalf, shall 
be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall 
become effective only upon such approval. No offering for sale at public 
auction or advertisement of sale

[[Page 553]]

will be necessary in reference to contracts of extension of leases, or 
to leases entered into under this section, as above provided, but such 
lease or contract shall be upon such terms as to bonus and royalty as 
may be determined and fixed in each case by the Secretary of the 
Interior under the provisions of Sec. 215.5. The approval by the 
Secretary of the Interior of new leases or of the contracts of extension 
of old leases shall be conclusive as to the validity of said leases, or 
contracts of extension of leases, the manner and method of negotiating 
the same, and the execution thereof. If, however, in any case where 
lands have heretofore been leased and lead and zinc ores have been 
discovered thereon, it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior 
that the extension of the existing lease or leases or the granting of 
new leases to the present lessees, or to the persons or parties holding 
under said lessees by assignment, sublease, or mining contract, would 
not be to the best interests of the Indian owners of the land, the 
Secretary of the Interior may, at the expiration, cancellation, or 
forfeiture of the existing lease, cause the mining lease rights on said 
land to be offered for sale at public auction to the highest bidder. If 
the lead and zinc mining lease on said land be offered for sale at 
public auction, the same procedure shall be followed as provided in 
Secs. 215.7 through 215.9.
    (b) Applications under the provision of this section for a lease or 
extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of 
lease will not be received or considered prior to the period of 1 year 
next preceding the date of the expiration of such valid existing lease 
or leases as may be on the land covered by such application.
    (c) Applications under the provisions of this section for a lease or 
extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of 
lease shall be filed with the superintendent of the Quapaw Agency at any 
time within the period of 1 year next preceding the date of the 
expiration of such valid existing lease or leases as may be on the land 
covered by such application, and if the records of or papers in the 
office of said superintendent or the records of the county court of 
Ottawa County, Okla., indicate that there are any prior existing leases, 
subleases, assignments of leases or mining contracts covering any of the 
land applied for, the superintendent shall notify all persons having or 
claiming any rights or interest in or under said prior existing leases, 
subleases, assignments of leases, or mining contract concerning said 
application for lease or extension of lease, and that they will be 
allowed 10 days in which to file with the superintendent any objection 
they may have to the allowance of the application or to the approval of 
the new lease or extension of existing lease. If objection or protest is 
made by any owner of the land or by any person claiming rights or 
interests in or under existing lease, sublease, assignment of lease, or 
mining contract, a reasonable time, not exceeding 20 days, shall be 
allowed them in which to file their statement or brief in support of 
their protest or objection, and a reasonable further time not exceeding 
10 days shall be allowed the applicant for new lease or for extension of 
existing lease to reply in support of the application. In case of 
contest, hearings may be had if deemed necessary by the Secretary of the 
Interior or his representative. The application and papers in each case 
shall be forwarded by the superintendent of the Quapaw Indian Agency to 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with his report and recommendation in 
regard thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 215.11  New leases where prior leases have been forfeited or abandoned.

    In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased and lead and 
zinc ores have been discovered but the mines and mining operations have 
been abandoned and the leases have been canceled or forfeited or have 
expired, special arrangements in the matter of the leasing and mining of 
said lands may be made provided the consent thereto of the Secretary of 
the Interior be first obtained. Applications containing special offers 
as to the terms and conditions may be considered by the Secretary of the 
Interior and the leasing of said lands may be made upon such special 
terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may in each case 
deem to be for the best interests of the Indian owners of the land.

[[Page 554]]

If, however, in any case, it shall appear to the Secretary of the 
Interior that the granting of such lease would not be to the best 
interest of the Indian owners of the land, the Secretary of the Interior 
may cause the mining lease rights on said land to be offered for sale at 
public auction to the highest bidder. If the lead and zinc mining lease 
on said land be offered for sale at public auction, the same procedure 
shall be followed as provided in Secs. 215.7 through 215.9.


<R05>
Sec. 215.12  Advertising costs.

    All advertising costs, publication fees, expenses incurred for 
abstracts of lease title, and other expenses incurred in connection with 
the advertising and sale of leases and in connection with the execution 
of lease contracts shall be borne by the lessee. In the event a lease of 
the land is offered to the highest bidder and he fails or refuses to 
execute such lease when duly notified and as required by or under the 
regulations in this part, and no other bid is accepted, such costs, 
fees, and expenses shall be paid from such money as he may have paid 
with his bid. If no bid is tendered after a tract is advertised, or if 
all bids are refused, said items of expenses shall be charged to the 
Indian owner of the land and be paid by him or be paid by the 
superintendent from any funds held by such superintendent to the credit 
of such Indian owner of the land.


<R05>
Sec. 215.13  Bond.

    Every mineral lease made and entered into under the regulations in 
this part, by an Indian or by the superintendent as his representative 
or in his behalf, must be accompanied by a surety bond, executed by the 
lessee and by a responsible surety company or two or more satisfactory 
sureties, guaranteeing the payment of all deferred installments of bonus 
and the payment of all specified royalties and rentals and the 
performance of all covenants and agreements undertaken by the lessee. 
Such bonds, unless authorized by the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative, with the consent of the Indian landowner, 
shall be not less than the following amounts:

For less than 80 acres--$2,500
For 80 acres and less than 120 acres--3,500
For 120 acres or more--5,000

    Provided, however, That the lessee may, in lieu of such surety bond 
and upon execution of a proper penal bond to the United States in the 
sum prescribed and a proper power of attorney to the Secretary of the 
Interior, submit therewith United States bonds or notes in the aggregate 
sum prescribed as security for the carrying out of the terms, 
conditions, and provisions of the lease: Provided further, That a lessee 
may file in lieu of such individual lease bonds, one bond in a sum to be 
fixed by the Secretary of the Interior covering all leases to which he 
is or may become a party. The right is specifically reserved to the 
Secretary of the Interior to require an increase of the amount of any 
bond above the sum named in any particular case where he deems it 
necessary to require such increased bond.

direct to the Indian lessor; but all such bonus, rents, royalties, and 
other payments accruing under any such lease shall be paid to the 
superintendent for the benefit of the Indian lessors, to be deposited by 
that officer to the credit of the superintendent in some bank designated 
for the deposit of individual Indian moneys.

<R05>
Sec. 216.1  Purpose.

    It is the policy of this Department to encourage the development of 
the mineral resources underlying Indian lands where mining is 
authorized. However, interest of the Indian owners and the public at 
large requires that, with respect to the exploration for, and the

[[Page 558]]

surface mining of, such minerals, adequate measures be taken to avoid, 
minimize, or correct damage to the environment--land, water, and air--
and to avoid, minimize, or correct hazards to the public health and 
safety. The regulations in this part prescribe procedures to that end.


<R05>
Sec. 216.2  Scope.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
regulations in this part provide for the protection and conservation of 
nonmineral resources during operations for the discovery, development, 
surface mining, and onsite processing of minerals under permits or 
leases issued pursuant to statutes pertaining to Indian lands including 
but not limited to the following statutes or amendments thereto:

    The Act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539);
    The Act of May 27, 1908 (35 Stat. 312);

    The Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1967);
    The Act of May 11, 1939 (52 Stat. 347, 25 U.S.C. 396a-f, and 5 
U.S.C. 301).

    (b) The regulations in this part do not cover the exploration for 
oil and gas or the issuance of leases, or operations thereunder, nor 
minerals underlying lands, the surface of which is not owned by the 
owner of the minerals.
    (c) The regulations in this part shall apply only to permits or 
leases issued subsequent to the date on which these regulations become 
effective and which are subject to the approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior or his designated representative.


<R05>
Sec. 216.3  Definitions.

    As used in the regulations in the part:
    (a) ``Superintendent'' means the superintendent or other officer of 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction under delegated 
authority, over the lands involved.
    (b) ``Mining supervisor'' means the Regional Mining Supervisor, or 
his authorized representative, of the Geological Survey authorized as 
provided in 30 CFR 211.3 and 231.2 to supervise operations on the land 
covered by a permit or lease.
    (c) ``Overburden'' means all the earth and other materials which lie 
above a natural deposit of minerals and such earth and other materials 
after removal from their natural state in the process of mining.
    (d) ``Area of land to be affected'' or ``area of land affected'' 
means the area of land from which overburden is to be or has been 
removed and upon which the overburden or waste is to be or has been 
deposited, and includes all lands affected by the construction of new 
roads or the improvement or use of existing roads to gain access to an 
operation and for haulage.
    (e) ``Operation'' means all of the premises, facilities, roads, and 
equipment used in the process of determining the location, composition 
or quality of a mineral deposit, or in developing, extracting, or onsite 
processing of a mineral deposit in a designated area.
    (f) ``Method of operation'' means the method or manner by which a 
cut or open pit is made, the overburden is placed or handled, water is 
controlled or affected and other acts performed by the operator in the 
process of exploring or uncovering and removing or onsite processing of 
a mineral deposit.
    (g) ``Holder'' or ``operator'' means the permittee or lessee 
designated in a permit or lease.
    (h) ``Reclamation'' means measures undertaken to bring about the 
necessary reconditioning or restoration of land or water that has been

<R05>
Sec. 216.4  Technical examination of prospective surface exploration and mining operations.

    (a)(1) In connection with an application for a permit or lease, the 
superintendent shall make, or cause to be made, a technical examination 
of the prospective effects of the proposed exploration or surface mining 
operations upon the environment. The technical examination shall take 
into consideration the need for the preservation and protection of other 
resources, including cultural, recreational, scenic, historic, and 
ecological values; and control of

[[Page 559]]

erosion, flooding, and pollution of water; the isolation of toxic 
materials; the prevention of air pollution; the reclamation by 
revegetation, replacement of soil or by other means, of lands affected 
by the exploration or mining operations; the prevention of slides; the 
protection of fish and wildlife and their habitat; and the prevention of 
hazards to public health and safety.
    (2) A technical examination of an area should be made with the 
recognition that actual potential mining sites and mining operations 
vary widely with respect to topography, climate, surrounding land uses, 
proximity to densely used areas, and other environmental influences and 
that mining and reclamation requirements should provide sufficient 
flexibility to permit adjustment to local conditions.
    (b) Based upon the technical examination, the superintendent shall 
formulate the general requirements which the applicant must meet for the 
protection of nonmineral resources during the conduct of exploration or 
mining operations and for the reclamation of lands or waters affected by 
exploration or mining operations. The general requirements shall be made 
known in writing to the applicant before the issuance of a permit or 
lease and upon acceptance thereof by the applicant, shall be 
incorporated in the permit or lease.
    (c) In each instance in which an application is made the mining 
supervisor shall participate in the technical examination and in the 
formulation of the general requirements.
    (d) The superintendent may prohibit or otherwise restrict operations 
on any part of an area whenever it is determined that such part of the 
area described in an application for a permit or lease is such that 
previous experience under similar conditions has shown that operations 
cannot feasibly be conducted by any known methods or measures to avoid--
    (1) Rock or landslides which would be a hazard to human lives or 
endanger or destroy private or public property; or
    (2) Substantial deposition of sediment and silt into streams, lakes, 
reservoirs; or
    (3) A lowering of water quality below standards established by the 
appropriate State water pollution control agency, or by the Secretary of 
the Interior, or his authorized representative; or
    (4) A lowering of the quality of waters whose quality exceeds that 
required by the established standards--unless and until it has been 
affirmatively demonstrated to the Secretary of the Interior, or his 
authorized representative, that such lowering of quality is necessary to 
economic and social development and will not preclude any assigned uses 
made of such waters; or
    (5) The destruction of key wildlife habitat or important scenic, 
historical, or other natural or cultural features.
    (e) If, on the basis of a technical examination, the superintendent 
determines that there is a likelihood that there will be a lowering of 
water quality as described in paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section 
caused by the operation, no lease or permit shall be issued until after 
consultation with the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration and 
a finding by the Administration that the proposed operation would not be 
in violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 
U.S.C. 466 et seq.), or of Executive Order No. 11288 (31 FR 9261). Where 
a permit or lease is involved the Superintendent's determination shall 
be made in consultation with the mining supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 216.5  Basis for denial of a permit or lease.

    An application for a permit or lease to conduct exploratory or 
mining operations may be denied any applicant who has forfeited a 
required bond because of failure to comply with a mining plan. However, 
a permit or lease may not be denied an applicant because of the 
forfeiture of a bond if the lands disturbed under his previous permit or 
lease have subsequently been reclaimed without cost to the lessor or the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 216.6  Approval of exploration plan.

    (a) Before commencing any surface disturbing operations to explore, 
test or prospect for minerals, the operator shall file with the mining 
supervisor a plan for the proposed exploration operations. The mining 
supervisor shall

[[Page 560]]

consult with the superintendent with respect to the surface protection 
and reclamation aspects before approving said plan.
    (b) Depending upon the size and nature of the operation and the 
requirements established pursuant to Sec. 216.4 the mining supervisor 
may require that the exploration plan submitted by the operator include 
any or all of the following:
    (1) A description of the area within which exploration is to be 
conducted;
    (2) Two copies of a suitable map or aerial photograph showing 
topographic, cultural and drainage features;
    (3) A statement of proposed exploration methods; i.e., drilling, 
trenching, etc., and the location of primary support roads and 
facilities;
    (4) A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control 
fire, soil erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, damage to 
fish and wildlife or other natural resources, and hazards to public 
health and safety both during and upon abandonment of exploration 
activities.
    (c) The mining supervisor shall promptly review the exploration plan 
submitted to him by the operator and shall indicate to the operator any 
changes, additions, or amendments necessary to meet the requirements 
formulated pursuant to Sec. 216.4, the provisions of these regulations, 
and the terms of the permit.
    (d) The operator shall comply with the provisions of an approved 
exploration plan. The mining supervisor may, with respect to such a 
plan, exercise the authority provided by paragraphs (f) and (g) of 
Sec. 216.7 respecting a mining plan.


<R05>
Sec. 216.7  Approval of mining plan.

    (a) Before surface mining operations may commence under any permit 
or lease, the operator must file a mining plan with the mining 
supervisor and obtain his approval of the plan. The mining supervisor 
shall consult with the superintendent with respect to the surface 
protection and reclamation aspects before approving said plan.
    (b) Depending on the size and nature of the operation and the 
requirements established pursuant to Sec. 216.4 the mining supervisor 
may require that the mining plan submitted by the operator include any 
or all of the following:
    (1) A description of the location and area to be affected by the 
operations;
    (2) Two copies of a suitable map, or aerial photograph showing the 
topography, the area covered by the permit or lease, the name and 
location of major topographic and cultural features, and the drainage 
plan away from the area affected;
    (3) A statement of proposed methods of operating, including a 
description of proposed roads or vehicular trails; the size and location 
of structures and facilities to be built;
    (4) An estimate of the quantity of water to be used and pollutants 
that are expected to enter any receiving waters;
    (5) A design for the necessary impoundment, treatment or control of 
all runoff water and drainage from workings so as to reduce soil erosion 
and sedimentation and to prevent the pollution of receiving waters;
    (6) A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control 
fire, soil erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, damage to 
fish and wildlife, and hazards to public health and safety; and
    (7) A statement of the proposed manner and time of performance of 
work to reclaim areas disturbed by the holder's operation.
    (c) In those instances in which the permit or lease requires the 
revegetation of an area of land to be affected, the mining plan shall 
show:
    (1) Proposed methods of preparation and fertilizing the soil prior 
to replanting;
    (2) Types and mixtures of shrubs, trees, or tree seedlings, grasses 
or legumes to be planted; and
    (3) Types and methods of planting, including the amount of grasses 
or legumes per acre, or the number and spacing of trees, or tree 
seedlings, or combinations of grasses and trees.
    (d) In those instances in which the permit or lease requires 
regrading and backfilling, the mining plan shall show the proposed 
methods and the timing of grading and backfilling of areas of land to be 
affected by the operation.

[[Page 561]]

    (e) The mining supervisor shall review the mining plan submitted to 
him by the operator and shall promptly indicate to the operator any 
changes, additions, or amendments necessary to meet the requirements 
formulated pursuant to Sec. 216.4, the provisions of these regulations 
and the terms of the permit or lease. The operator shall comply with the 
provisions of an approved mining plan.
    (f) A mining plan may be changed by mutual consent of the mining 
supervisor and the operator at any time to adjust to changed conditions 
or to correct any oversight. To obtain approval of a change or 
supplemental plan, the operator shall submit a written statement of the 
proposed changes or supplement and the justification for the changes 
proposed. The mining supervisor shall promptly notify the operator that 
he consents to the proposed changes or supplement, or in the event he 
does not consent, he shall specify the modifications thereto under which 
the proposed changes or supplement would be acceptable. After mutual 
acceptance of a change of a plan, the operator shall not depart 
therefrom without further approval.
    (g) If circumstances warrant or if development of a mining plan for 
the entire operation is dependent upon unknown factors which cannot or 
will not be determined except during the progress of the operations, a 
partial plan may be approved and supplemented from time to time. The 
operator shall not, however, perform any operation except under an 
approved plan.


<R05>
Sec. 216.8  Performance bond.

    (a) Upon approval of an exploration plan or mining plan, the 
operator shall be required to file a suitable performance bond of not 
less than $2,000 with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary of 
the Interior, and the bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful 
compliance with applicable regulations, the terms and conditions of the 
permit, lease, or contract, and the exploration or mining plan as 
approved, amended or supplemented. The bond shall be in an amount 
sufficient to satisfy the reclamation requirements established pursuant 
to an approved exploration or mining plan, or an approved partial or 
supplemental plan. In determining the amount of the bond consideration 
shall be given to the character and nature of the reclamation 
requirements and the estimated costs of reclamation in the event that 
the operator forfeits his performance bond. In lieu of a surety bond an 
operator may elect to deposit cash or negotiable bonds of the U.S. 
government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities 
shall be equal at least to the required sum of the bond.
    (b) In a particular instance where the circumstances are such as to 
warrant an exception, the amount of the bond for a particular operation 
may be reduced to less than the required minimum of $2,000.
    (c) The superintendent shall set the amount of a bond and take the 
necessary action for an increase or for a complete or partial release of 
a bond. He shall take action with respect to bonds for leases or permits 
only after consultation with the mining supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 216.9  Reports.

    (a) Within 30 days after the end of each calendar year, or if 
operations cease before the end of a calendar year, within 30 days after 
the cessation of operations, the operator shall submit an operations 
report to the mining supervisor containing the following information:
    (1) An identification of the permit or lease and the location of the 
operation.
    (2) A description of the operations performed during the period of 
time for which the report is filed.
    (3) An identification of the area of land affected by the operations 
and a description of the manner in which the land has been affected.
    (4) A statement as to the number of acres disturbed by the 
operations and the number of acres which were reclaimed during the 
period of time.
    (5) A description of the method utilized for reclamation and the 
results thereof.
    (6) A statement and description of reclamation work remaining to be 
done.
    (b) Upon completion of such grading and backfilling as may be 
required by an approved exploration or mining

[[Page 562]]

plan, the operator shall make a report thereon to the mining supervisor 
and request inspection for approval. Whenever it is determined by such 
inspection that backfilling and grading have been carried out in 
accordance with the established requirements and approved exploration or 
mining plan, the superintendent shall issue a release of an appropriate 
amount of the performance bond for the area graded and backfilled. 
Appropriate amounts of the bond shall be retained to assure that 
satisfactory planting, if required, is carried out.
    (c)(1) Whenever planting is required by an approved exploration or 
mining plan, the operator shall file a report with the superintendent 
whenever such planting is completed. The report shall--
    (i) Identify the permit or lease;
    (ii) Show the type of planting or seeding, including mixtures and 
amounts;
    (iii) Show the date of planting or seeding;
    (iv) Identify or describe the areas of the lands which have been 
planted;
    (v) Contain such other information as may be relevant.
    (2) The superintendent, as soon as possible after the completion of 
the first full growing season, shall make an inspection and evaluation 
of the vegetative cover and planting to determine if a satisfactory 
growth has been established.
    (3) If it is determined that a satisfactory vegetative cover has 
been established and is likely to continue to grow, any remaining 
portion of the surety bond may be released if all requirements have been 
met by the operator.
    (d)(1) Not less than 30 days prior to cessation or abandonment of 
operations, the operator shall report to the mining supervisor his 
intention to cease or abandon operations, together with a statement of 
the exact number of acres of land affected by his operations, the extent 
of reclamation accomplished and other relevant information.
    (2) Upon receipt of such report an inspection shall be made to 
determine whether operations have been carried out in accordance with 
the approved exploration or mining plan.


<R05>
Sec. 216.10  Inspection: Notice of noncompliance: Revocation.

    (a) The mining supervisor and superintendent shall have the right to 
enter upon the lands under a permit or lease, at any reasonable time, 
for the purpose of inspection or investigation to determine whether the 
terms and conditions of the permit or lease and the requirements of the 
exploration or mining plan have been complied with.
    (b) If the mining supervisor determines that an operator has failed 
to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit or lease, or with 
the requirements of an exploration or mining plan, or with the 
provisions of applicable regulations, the superintendent shall serve a 
notice of noncompliance upon the operator by delivery in person to him 
or his agent or by certified or registered mail addressed to the 
operator at his last known address.
    (c) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respects the 
operator has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit 
or lease or the requirements of an exploration or mining plan, or the 
provisions of applicable regulations, and shall specify the action which 
must be taken to correct the noncompliance and the time limits within 
which such action must be taken.
    (d) Failure of the operator to take action in accordance with the 
notice of noncompliance shall be grounds for suspension by the mining 
supervisor of operations or for the initiation of action for the 
cancellation of the permit or lease and for forfeiture of the surety 
bond required under Sec. 216.8.


<R05>
Sec. 216.11  Appeals.

    An applicant, permittee, lessee, or lessor aggrieved by a decision

<R05>
Sec. 225.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part, administered by the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, 
govern minerals

[[Page 565]]

agreements for the development of Indian-owned minerals entered into 
pursuant to the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, 25 U.S.C. 2101-
2108 (IMDA). These regulations are applicable to the lands or interests 
in lands of any Indian tribe, individual Indian or Alaska native the 
title to which is held in trust by the United States or is subject to a 
restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. These 
regulations are intended to ensure that Indian mineral owners are 
permitted to enter into minerals agreements that will allow the Indian 
mineral owners to have more responsibility in overseeing and greater 
flexibility in disposing of their mineral resources, and to allow 
development in the manner which the Indian mineral owners believe will 
maximize their best economic interest and minimize any adverse 
environmental or cultural impact resulting from such development. 
Pursuant to section 4 of the IMDA (25 U.S.C. 2103(e)), as part of this 
greater flexibility, where the Secretary has approved a minerals 
agreement in compliance with the provisions of 25 U.S.C. chap. 23 and 
any other applicable provision of law, the United States shall not be 
liable for losses sustained by a tribe or individual Indian under such 
minerals agreement. However, as further stated in the IMDA, the 
Secretary continues to have a trust obligation to ensure that the rights 
of a tribe or individual Indian are protected in the event of a 
violation of the terms of any minerals agreement, and to uphold the 
duties of the United States as derived from the trust relationship and 
from any treaties, executive orders, or agreements between the United 
States and any Indian tribe.
    (b) The regulations in this part shall become effective and in full 
force on April 29, 1994, and shall be subject to amendment at any time 
by the Secretary; Provided, that no such regulation that becomes 
effective after the date of approval of any minerals agreement shall 
operate to affect the duration of the minerals agreement, the rate of 
royalty or financial consideration, rental, or acreage unless agreed to 
by all parties to the minerals agreement.
    (c) The regulations of the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of 
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Minerals Management 
Service that are referenced in Secs. 225.4, 225.5, and 225.6 are 
supplemental to these regulations, and apply to minerals agreements for 
development of Indian mineral resources unless specifically stated 
otherwise in this part or in other Federal regulations. To the extent 
the parties to a minerals agreement are able to provide reasonable 
provisions satisfactorily addressing the issues of valuation, method of 
payment, accounting, and auditing, governed by the Minerals Management 
Service regulations, the Secretary may approve alternate provisions in a 
minerals agreement.
    (d) Nothing in these regulations is intended to prevent Indian 
tribes from exercising their lawful governmental authority to regulate 
the conduct of persons, businesses, or minerals operations within their 
territorial jurisdiction.

<R05>
Sec. 225.31  Manner of payments.

    Unless specified otherwise in the minerals agreement, after 
production has been established, all payments due for royalties, 
bonuses, rentals and other payments under a minerals agreement shall be 
made to the Secretary or such other party as may be designated, and 
shall be made at such time as provided in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters 
A and C. Prior to production, all bonus and rental payments, shall be 
made to the Superintendent or Area Director.


<R05>
Sec. 225.32  Permission to start operations.

    (a) No exploration, drilling, or mining operations are permitted on 
any Indian lands before the Secretary has granted written approval of 
the minerals agreement pursuant to the regulations. After a minerals 
agreement is approved, written permission to start operations must be 
secured by applying for the permits referred to in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Applicable permits in accordance with rules and regulations in 
30 CFR part 750, 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, 3590, and Orders or 
Notices to Lessees (NTL) issued thereunder shall be required before 
actual operations are conducted on the minerals agreement acreage.


<R05>
Sec. 225.33  Assignment of minerals agreements.

    An assignment of a minerals agreement, or any interest therein, 
shall not be valid without the approval of the Secretary and, if 
required in the minerals agreement, the Indian mineral owner. The 
assignee must be qualified to hold the minerals agreement and shall 
furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned on the faithful performance of 
the covenants and conditions thereof as stipulated in the minerals 
agreement. A fully executed copy of the assignment shall be filed with 
the Secretary within five (5) working days after execution by all 
parties. The Secretary may permit the release of any bonds executed by 
the assignor upon submission of satisfactory bonds to the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs by the assignee, and a determination that the assignor 
has satisfied all accrued obligations.
Sec. 225.34  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 225.35  Inspection of premises; books and accounts.

    (a) Operators shall allow Indian mineral owners, their authorized 
representatives, or any authorized representatives of the Secretary to 
enter all parts of the minerals agreement area for the purpose of 
inspection. Operators shall keep a full and correct account of all 
operations and submit all related reports required by the minerals 
agreement and applicable regulations. Books and records shall be 
available for inspection during regular business hours.
    (b) Operators shall provide records to the Minerals Management 
Service (MMS) in accordance with MMS regulations and guidelines. All 
records pertaining to a minerals agreement shall be maintained by an 
operator in accordance with 30 CFR part 212.

[[Page 573]]

    (c) Operators shall provide records to the Authorized Officer in 
accordance with BLM regulations and guidelines.
    (d) Operators shall provide records to the Director's Representative 
in accordance with OSMRE regulations and guidelines.


<R05>
Sec. 225.36  Minerals agreement cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs notice of noncompliance.

    (a) If the Secretary determines that an operator has failed to 
comply with the regulations in this part; other applicable laws or 
regulations; the terms of the minerals agreement; the requirements of an 
approved exploration, drilling or mining plan; Secretarial orders; or 
the orders of the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or 
the MMS Official, the Secretary may:
    (1) Serve a notice of noncompliance; or
    (2) Serve a notice of proposed cancellation.
    (b) The notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect the 
operator has failed to comply with the requirements referenced in 
paragraph (a), and shall specify what actions, if any, must be taken to 
correct the noncompliance.
    (c) The notice of proposed cancellation shall set forth the reasons 
why cancellation is proposed.
    (d) The notice of proposed cancellation or noncompliance shall be 
served upon the operator by delivery in person or by certified mail to 
the operator at the operator's last known address. When certified mail 
is used, the date of service shall be deemed to be when received or five 
(5) working days after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (e) The operator shall have thirty (30) days (or such longer time as 
specified in the notice) from the date that the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
notice of proposed cancellation or noncompliance is served to respond, 
in writing, to the Superintendent or Area Director actually issuing the 
notice.
    (f) If an operator fails to take any action that may be prescribed 
in the notice of proposed cancellation, fails to file a timely written 
response to the notice, or files a written response that does not, in 
the discretion of the Secretary, adequately justify the operator's 
failure to comply, then the Secretary may cancel the minerals agreement, 
specifying the basis for the cancellation. Cancellation of a minerals 
agreement shall not relieve the operator of any continuing obligation 
under the minerals agreement.
    (g) If an operator fails to take corrective action or to file a 
timely written response adequately justifying the operator's actions 
pursuant to a notice of noncompliance, the Secretary may issue an order 
of cessation. If the operator fails to comply with the order of 
cessation, or fails to timely file an appeal of the order of cessation 
pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section, the Secretary may issue an 
order of minerals agreement cancellation.
    (h) This section does not limit any other remedies of the Indian 
mineral owner as set forth in the minerals agreement.
    (i) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of 
the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS 
Official to take any enforcement action authorized pursuant to statute 
or regulation.
    (j) The Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, the MMS 
Official, and the Superintendent or Area Director should consult with 
one another before taking any enforcement actions.
    (k) If orders of cessation or minerals agreement cancellation issued 
pursuant to this section are issued by a designee of the Secretary other 
than the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, the orders may be 
appealed under 25 CFR part 2. If the orders are issued by the Secretary 
or the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, and not one of their 
delegates or subordinates, the orders are the final orders of the 
Department.


<R05>
Sec. 225.37  Penalties.

    (a) In addition to or in lieu of cancellation under Sec. 225.36, 
violations of the terms and conditions of any minerals agreement, the 
regulations in this part, other applicable laws or regulations, or 
failure to comply with a notice of noncompliance or a cessation order 
issued by the Secretary may subject an operator to a penalty of not more 
than $1,000 per day for each day

[[Page 574]]

that such a violation or noncompliance continues beyond the time limits 
prescribed for corrective action.
    (b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the operator 
either personally or by certified mail to the operator at the operator's 
last known address. The date of service by certified mail shall be 
deemed to be the date received or five (5) working days after the date 
mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the 
proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the operator of the 
operator's right to either request a hearing within thirty (30) days of 
receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. Hearings shall be 
held before the Superintendent or Area Director whose findings shall be 
conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2. If 
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of proposed penalty the 
operator has not requested a hearing or paid the amount of the proposed 
penalty, a final notice of penalty shall be served.
    (d) If the person served with a notice of proposed penalty requests 
a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the violations or 
noncompliance set forth in the notice continue beyond the time limits 
presented for corrective action. The Secretary may issue a written 
suspension of the requirement to correct the violations pending 
completion of the hearings provided by this section only upon a 
determination, at the discretion of the Secretary, that such a 
suspension will not be detrimental to the Indian mineral owner and upon 
submission and acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the 
Indian mineral owner from loss or damage. The amount of the bond must be 
sufficient to cover the cost of correcting the violations set forth in 
the notice or any disputed amounts plus accrued penalties and interest.
    (e) Payment of penalties in full more than ten (10) days after a 
final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the operator to late 
payment charges. Late payment charges shall be calculated on the basis 
of a percentage assessment rate of the amount unpaid per month for each 
month or fraction thereof until payment is received by the Secretary. In 
the absence of a specific minerals agreement provision prescribing a 
different rate, the interest rate on late payments and underpayments 
shall be a rate applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the amount of 
payment not received and only for the number of days the payment is 
late.
    (f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:
    (1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the 
Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS Official 
to impose penalties under applicable statutory or regulatory 
authorities;
    (2) Replacing, superseding, or replicating any penalty provision in 
the terms and conditions of a minerals agreement approved by the 
Secretary pursuant to this part; or
    (3) Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of 
minerals agreement provisions for which the Authorized Officer, 
Director's Representative, or MMS Official has either statutory or 
regulatory authority to assess a penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 225.38  Appeals.

    Appeals from decisions of Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
under this part may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 225.39  Fees.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each minerals 
agreement or assignment thereof, shall be accompanied by a filing fee of 
$75.00 at the time of filing.
    (b) An Indian mineral owner shall not be required to pay a filing 
fee if the Indian mineral owner, pursuant to a provision in the existing 
minerals agreement, acquires an additional interest in that minerals 
agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 225.40  Government employees cannot acquire minerals agreements.

    U.S. Government employees are prevented from acquiring any 
interest(s) in minerals agreements by the provisions of 25 CFR part 140 
and 43 CFR part 20 pertaining to conflicts of interest and ownership of 
an interest in trust land.

    (a) Written application, together with any nomination fee, for 
tracts to be offered for lease shall be filed with the Superintendent.
    (b) The Superintendent, with the consent of the Osage Tribal 
Council, shall publish notices for the sale of oil leases, gas leases,

submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be granted for 
remitting the balance of moneys due. If the bidder fails to pay the full 
cash consideration within said period or fails to file the completed 
lease within said period or extention thereof, or if the lease is 
rejected through no fault of the Osage Tribal Council or the 
Superintendent, 25 percent of the cash bonus bid will be forfeited for 
the use and benefits of the Osage Tribe. The Superintendent may reject a 
lease made on an accepted bid, upon evidence satisfactory to him of 
collusion, fraud, or other irregularity in connection with the notice of 
sale. The Superintendent may approve oil leases, gas leases, and oil and 
gas leases made by the Osage Tribal Council in conformity with the 
notice of sale, regulations in this part, bonds, and other instruments 
required.
    (c) Each oil and/or gas lease and activities and installations 
associated therewith subject to these regulations shall be assessed and 
evaluated for its environmental impact prior to its approval by the 
Superintendent.
    (d) Lessee shall accept a lease with the understanding that a 
mineral not covered by his lease may be leased separately.
    (e) No lease, assignment thereof, or interest therein will be 
approved to any employee or employees of the Government and no such 
employee shall be

[[Page 577]]

permitted to acquire any interest in leases covering the Osage Mineral 
Estate by ownership of stock in corporations having leases or in any 
other manner.
    (f) The Osage Tribal Council may utilize the following procedures 
among others, in entering into a mining lease. A contract may be entered 
into through competitive bidding as outlined in Sec. 226.2(b),

    Lessee may, with the approval of the Superintendent and payment of a 
$10 filing fee, surrender all or any portion of any lease, have the 
lease cancelled as to the portion surrendered and be relieved from all 
subsequent obligations and liabilities. If the lease, or portion being 
surrendered, is owned in undivided interests by more than one party, 
then all parties shall join in the application for cancellation: 
Provided, That if this lease has been recorded, Lessee shall execute a 
release and record the same in the proper office. Such surrender shall 
not entitle Lessee to a refund of the unused portion of rental paid in 
lieu of development, nor shall it relieve Lessee and his sureties of any 
obligation and liability incurred prior to such surrender: Provided 
further, That when there is a partial surrender of any lease and the 
acreage to be retained is less than 160 acres or there is a surrender of 
a separate horizon, such surrender shall become effective only with the 
consent of the Osage Tribal Council and approval of the Superintendent.

    Sums due under a lease contract and/or the regulations in this part 
shall be paid by cash or check made payable to the Bureau of Indian

Sec. 226.5  Leases subject to current regulations.

    Leases issued pursuant to this part shall be subject to the current 
regulations of the Secretary, all of which are made a part of such 
leases: Provided, That no amendment or change of such regulations made 
after the approval of any lease shall operate to affect the term of the 
lease, rate of royalty, rental, or acreage unless agreed to by both 
parties and approved by the Superintendent.

each quarter section or fractional quarter section covered by said 
lease: Provided, however, That one bond in the penal sum or not less 
than $50,000 may be filed on Form G covering all oil, gas and 
combination oil and gas leases not in excess of 10,240 acres to which 
Lessee is or may become a party.
    (b) In lieu of the bonds required under paragraph (a) of this 
section, a bond in the penal sum of $150,000 may be filed on Form 5-5438 
for full nationwide coverage of all leases, without geographic or 
acreage limitation, to which the Lessee is or may become a party.
    (c) A bond on Form H shall be filed in an amount of not less than 
$5,000 covering a lease acquired through assignment where the assignee 
does not have a collective bond on form G or nationwide bond, or the 
corporate surety does not execute its consent to remain bound under the 
original bond given to secure the faithful performance of the terms and 
conditions of the lease.
    (d) The right is specifically reserved to increase the amount of 
bonds prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section in any 
particular case when the Superintendent deems it proper. The

[[Page 578]]

nationwide bond may be increased at any time in the discretion of the 
Secretary.

amended at 55 FR 33114, Aug. 14, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 226.7  Provisions of forms made a part of the regulations.

    Leases, assignments, and supporting instruments shall be in the form 
prescribed by the Secretary, and such forms are hereby made a part of 
the regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 226.8  Corporation and corporate information.

    (a) If the applicant for a lease is a corporation, it shall file 
evidence of authority of its officers to execute papers; and with its 
first application it shall also file a certified copy of its Articles of 
Incorporation and, if foreign to the State of Oklahoma, evidence showing 
compliance with the corporation laws thereof.
    (b) Whenever deemed advisable the Superintendent may require a 
corporation to file any additional information necessary to carry out 
the purpose and intent of the regulations in this part, and such 
information shall be furnished within a reasonable time.


<R05>
Sec. 226.9  Rental and drilling obligations.

    (a) Oil leases, gas leases, and combination oil and gas leases. 
Unless Lessee shall complete and place on production a well producing 
and selling oil and/or gas in paying quantities on the land embraced 
within the lease within 12 months from the date of approval of the 
lease, or as otherwise provided in the lease terms, or 12 months from 
the date the Superintendent consents to drilling on any restricted 
homestead selection, the lease shall terminate unless rental at the rate 
of not less than $1 per acre for an oil or gas lease, or not less than 
$2.00 per acre for a combination oil and gas lease, shall be paid before 
the end of the first year of the lease. The lease may also be held for 
the remainder of its primary term without drilling upon payment of the 
specified rental annually in advance, commencing with the second lease 
year. The lease shall terminate as of the due date of the rental unless 
such rental shall be received by the Superintendent, or shall have been 
mailed as indicated by postmark on or before said date. The completion 
of a well producing in paying quantities shall, for so long as such 
production continues, relieve Lessee from any further payment of rental, 
except that should such production cease during the primary term the 
lease may be continued only during the remaining primary term of the 
lease by payment of advance rental which shall commence on the next 
anniversary date of the lease. Rental shall be paid on the basis of a 
full year and no refund will be made of advance rental paid in 
compliance with the regulations in this part: Provided, That the 
Superintendent in his discretion may order further development of any 
leased acreage or separate horizon if, in his opinion, a prudent 
operator would conduct further development. If Lessee refuses to comply, 
the refusal will be considered a violation of the lease terms and said 
lease shall be subject to cancellation as to the acreage or horizon the 
further development of which was ordered: Provided further, That the 
Superintendent may impose restrictions as to time of drilling and rate 
of production from any well or wells when in his judgment, such action 
may be necessary or proper for the protection of the natural resources 
of the leased land and the interests of the Osage Tribe. The 
superintendent may consider, among other things, Federal and Oklahoma 
laws regulating either drilling or production. If a lessee holds both an 
oil lease and a gas lease covering the same acreage, such lessee is 
subject to the provisions of this section as to both the oil lease and 
the gas lease.
    (b) The Superintendent may, with the consent of and under terms 
approved by the Osage Tribal Council, grant an extension of the primary 
term of a lease on which the actual drilling of a well shall have 
commenced within the term thereof or for the purpose of enabling Lessee 
to obtain a market for his oil and/or gas production.

Sec. 226.11  Royalty payments.

    (a) Royalty on oil--(1) Royalty rate. Lessee shall pay or cause to 
be paid to the Superintendent, as royalty, the sum of not less than 
16\2/3\ percent of the gross proceeds from sales after deducting the oil 
used by Lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease: 
Provided, That when the quantity of oil taken from all the producing 
wells on any quarter-section or fraction thereof, according to the 
public survey, during any calendar month is sufficient to average one 
hundred or more barrels per active producing well per day the royalty on 
such oil shall be not less than 20 percent. The Osage Tribal Council 
may, upon presentation of justifiable economic evidence by Lessee, agree 
to a revised royalty rate subject to approval by the Superintendent, 
applicable to additional oil produced from a lease or leases by enhanced 
recovery methods, which rate shall not be less than 12\1/2\ percent of 
the gross proceeds from sale of oil produced by enhanced recovery 
processes, other than gas injection, after deducting the oil used by 
Lessee for development and operating purposes on the lease or leases.
    (2) Unless the Osage Tribal Council, with approval of the Secretary, 
shall elect to take the royalty in kind, payment is owing at the time of 
sale or removal of the oil, except where payments are made on division 
orders, and settlement shall be based on the actual selling price, but 
at not less than the highest posted price by a major purchaser (as 
defined in Sec. 226.1(h)) in Osage County, Oklahoma, who purchases 
production from Osage oil leases.
    (3) Royalty in kind. Should Lessor, with approval of the Secretary, 
elect to take the royalty in kind, Lessee shall furnish free storage for 
royalty oil for a period not to exceed 60 days from date of production 
after notice of such election.
    (b) Royalty on gas--(1) Oil lease. All casinghead gas shall belong 
to the oil Lessee subject to any rights under existing gas leases. All 
casinghead gas removed from the lease from which it is produced shall be 
metered unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent and be subject 
to a royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ percent of the market value of the 
gas and all products extracted therefrom, less a reasonable allowance 
for manufacture or processing. If an oil Lessee supplies casinghead gas 
produced from one lease for operation and/or development of other 
leases, either his/hers or others, a royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ 
percent shall be paid on the market value of all casinghead gas so used. 
All casinghead gas not utilized by the oil Lessee may, with the approval 
of the Superintendent, be utilized or sold by the gas Lessee, subject to 
the prescribed royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ percent of the market 
value.
    (2) Gas lease. Lessee shall pay a royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ 
percent of the market value value of all natural gas and products 
extracted therefrom produced and sold from his lease. Natural gas used 
in the reasonable and prudent operation and development of said lease 
shall be exempted from royalty payment.
    (3) Combination oil and gas lease. Lessee shall pay royalty as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (c) Minimum royalty. In no event shall the royalty paid from 
producing leases during any year be less than an amount equal to the 
annual rental specified for the lease. Any underpayment of minimum 
royalty shall be due and payable within 45 days following the end of the 
lease year. After the primary term, Lessee shall submit with his payment 
evidence that the lease is producing in paying quantities. The 
Superintendent is authorized to determine whether the lease is actually 
producing in paying quantities or has terminated for lack of such 
production. Payment for any underpayment not made within the time 
specified shall be subject to a late charge at the rate of not less than 
1\1/2\

[[Page 580]]

percent per month for each month or fraction thereof until paid.

lease at not less than the highest posted price as defined in 
Sec. 226.11.


<R05>
Sec. 226.13  Time of royalty payments and reports.

    (a) Royalty payments due may be paid by either purchaser or Lessee. 
Unless otherwise provided by the Osage Tribal Council and approved by 
the Superintendent, all payments shall be due by the 25th day of each 
month and shall cover the sales of the preceding month. Failure to make 
such payments shall subject Lessee or purchaser, whoever is responsible 
for royalty payment, to a late charge at the rate of not less than 1\1/
2\ percent for each month or fraction thereof until paid. The Osage 
Tribal Council, subject to the approval of the Superintendent, may waive 
the late charges.
    (b) Lessee shall furnish certified monthly reports by the 25th of 
each following month covering all operations, whether there has been 
production or not, indicating therein the total amount of oil, natural 
gas, casinghead gas, and other products subject to royalty payment.
    (c) Failure to remit payments or reports shall subject Lessee to 
further penalties as provided in Secs. 226.42 and 226.43 and shall 
subject the division order to cancellation.

<R05>
Sec. 226.14  Contracts and division orders.

    (a) Lessee may enter into division orders or contracts with the 
purchasers of oil, gas, or derivatives therefrom which will provide for 
the purchaser to make payment of royalty in accordance with his lease: 
Provided, That such division orders or contracts shall not relieve 
Lessee from responsibility for the payment of the royalty should the 
purchaser fail to pay. No production shall be removed from the leased 
premises until a division order and/or contract and its terms are 
approved by the Superintendent: Provided further, That the 
Superintendent may grant temporary permission to run oil or gas from a 
lease pending the approval of a division order or contract. Lessee shall 
file a certified monthly report and pay royalty on the value of all oil 
and gas used off the premises for development and operating purposes. 
Lessee shall be responsible for the correct measurement and reporting of 
all oil and/or gas taken from the leased premises.
    (b) Lessee shall require the purchaser of oil and/or gas from his/
her lease or leases to furnish the Superintendent, no later than the 
25th day of each month, a statement reporting the gross barrels of oil 
and/or gross Mcf of gas sold during the preceding month. The 
Superintendent may authorize an extension of time, not to exceed 10 
days, for furnishing this statement.

<R05>
Sec. 226.15  Unit leases, assignments and related instruments.

    (a) Unitization of leases. The Osage Tribal Council and Lessee or 
Lessees, may, with the approval of the Superintendent, unitize or merge, 
two or more oil or oil and gas leases into a unit or cooperative 
operating plan to promote the greatest ultimate recovery of oil and gas 
from a common source of supply or portion thereof embracing the lands 
covered by such lease or leases. The cooperative or unit agreement shall 
be subject to the regulations in this part and applicable laws governing 
the leasing of the Osage Mineral Estate. Any agreement between the 
parties in interest to terminate a unit or cooperative agreement as to 
all or any portion of the lands included shall be submitted to the 
Superintendent for his approval. Upon approval the leases included 
thereunder shall be restored to their original terms: Provided, That for 
the purpose of preventing

[[Page 581]]

waste and to promote the greatest ultimate recovery of oil and gas from 
a common source of supply or portion thereof, all oil leases, oil and 
gas leases, and gas leases issued heretofore and hereafter under the 
provisions of the regulations in this part shall be subject to any unit 
development plan affecting the leased lands that may be required by the 
Superintendent with the consent of the Osage Tribal Council, and which 
plan shall adequately protect the rights of all parties in interest 
including the Osage Mineral Estate.
    (b) Assignments. Approved leases or any interest therein may be 
assigned or transferred only with the approval of the Superintendent. 
The assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under existing rules 
and regulations and shall furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned for 
the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof. Lessee 
must assign either his entire interest in a lease or legal subdivision 
thereof, or an undivided interest in the whole lease: Provided, That 
when an assignment covers only a portion of a lease or covers interests 
in separate horizons such assignment shall be subject to both the 
consent of the Osage Tribal Council and approval of the Superintendent. 
If a lease is divided by the assignment of an entire interest in any 
part, each part shall be considered a separate lease and the assignee 
shall be bound to comply with all the terms and conditions of the 
original lease. A fully executed copy of the assignment shall be filed 
with the Superintendent within 30 days after the date of execution by 
all parties. If requested within the 30-day period, the Superintendent 
may grant an extension of 15 days. A filing fee of $10 shall accompany 
each assignment.
    (c) Overriding royalty. Agreements creating overriding royalties or 
payments out of production shall not be considered as an interest in a 
lease as such term is used in paragraph (b) of this section. Agreements 
creating overriding royalties or payments out of production are hereby 
authorized and the approval of the Department of the Interior or any 
agency thereof shall not be required with respect thereto, but such 
agreements shall be subject to the condition that nothing in any such 
agreement shall be construed as modifying any of the obligations of 
Lessee under his lease and the regulations in this part. All such 
obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free 
of any such royalties or payments. The existence of agreements creating 
overriding royalties or payments out of production, whether or not 
acutally paid, shall not be considered in justifying the shutdown or 
abandonment of any well. Agreements creating overriding royalties or 
payments out of production need not be filed with the Superintendent 
unless incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. An agreement creating 
overriding royalties or payment out of production shall be suspended 
when the working interest income per active producing well is equal to 
or less than the operational cost of the well, as determined by the 
Superintendent.
    (d) Drilling contracts. The Superintendent is authorized to approve 
drilling contracts with a stipulation that such approval does not in any 
way bind the Department to approve subsequent assignments that may be 
provided for in said contracts. Approval merely authorizes entry on the 
lease for the purpose of development work.
    (e) Combining leases. The lessee owning both an oil lease and gas 
lease covering the same acreage is authorized to convert such leases to 
a combination oil and gas lease.

                               Operations


<R05>
Sec. 226.16  Commencement of operations.

    (a) No operations shall be permitted upon any tract of land until a 
lease covering such tract shall have been approved by the 
Superintendent: Provided, That the Superintendent may grant authority to 
any party under such rules, consistent with the regulations in this part 
that he deems proper, to conduct geophysical and geological exploration 
work.

[[Page 582]]

    (b) Lessee shall submit applications on forms to be furnished by the 
Superintendent and secure his approval before:
    (1) Well drilling, treating, or workover operations are started on 
the leased premises.
    (2) Removing casing from any well.
    (c) Lessee shall notify the Superintendent a reasonable time in 
advance of starting work, of intention to drill, redrill, deepen, plug, 
or abandon a well.


<R05>
Sec. 226.17  How to acquire permission to begin operations on a restricted homestead allotment.

    (a) Lessee may conduct operations within or upon a restricted 
homestead selection only with the written consent of the Superintendent.
    (b) If the allottee is unwilling to permit operations on his 
homestead, the Superintendent will cause an examination of the premises 
to be made with the allottee and lessee or his representative. Upon 
finding that the interests of the Osage Tribe require that the tract be 
developed, the Superintendent will endeavor to have the parties agree 
upon the terms under which operations on the homestead may be conducted.
    (c) In the event the allottee and lessee cannot reach an agreement, 
the matter shall be presented by all parties before the Osage Tribal 
Council, and the Council shall make its recommendations. Such 
recommendations shall be considered as final and binding upon the 
allottee and lessee. A guardian may represent the allottee. Where no one 
is authorized or where no person is deemed by the Superintendent to be a 
proper party to speak for a person of unsound mind or feeble 
understanding, the Principal Chief of the Osage Tribe shall represent 
him.
    (d) If the allottee or his representative does not appear before the 
Osage Tribal Council when notified by the Superintendent, or if the 
Council fails to act within 10 days after the matter is referred to it, 
the Superintendent may authorize lessee to proceed with operations in 
conformity with the provisions of his lease and the regulations in this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 226.18  Information to be given surface owners prior to commencement of drilling operations.

    Except for the surveying and staking of a well, no operations of any 
kind shall commence until the lessee or his/her authorized 
representative shall meet with the surface owner or his/her 
representative, if a resident of and present in Osage County, Oklahoma. 
Unless waived by the Superintendent or otherwise agreed to between the 
lessee and surface owner, such meeting shall be held at least 10 days 
prior to the commencement or any operations, except for the surveying 
and staking of the well. At such meeting lessee or his/her authorized 
representative shall comply with the following requirements:
    (a) Indicate the location of the well or wells to be drilled.
    (b) Arrange for route of ingress and egress. Upon failure to agree 
on route ingress and egress, said route shall be set by the 
Superintendent.
    (c) Impart to said surface owners the name and address of the party 
or representative upon whom the surface owner shall serve any claim for 
damages which he may sustain from mineral development or operations, and 
as to the procedure for settlement thereof as provided in Sec. 226.21
    (d) Where the drilling is to be on restricted land, lessee or his 
authorized representative in the manner provided above shall meet with 
the Superintendent.
    (e) When the surface owner or his/her representative is not a 
resident of, or is not physically present in, Osage County, Oklahoma, or 
cannot be contacted at the last known address, the Superintendent may 
authorize lessee to proceed with operations.

[39 FR 22254, June 21, 1974, as amended at 41 FR 50648, Nov. 17, 1976; 
43 FR 8136, Feb. 28, 1978. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982, 
as amended at 55 FR 33115, Aug. 14, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 226.19  Use of surface of land.

    (a) Lessee or his/her authorized representative shall have the right 
to use so much of the surface of the land within the Osage Mineral 
Estate as may be reasonable for operations and marketing. This includes 
but is not

[[Page 583]]

limited to the right to lay and maintain pipelines, electric lines, pull 
rods, other appliances necessary for operations and marketing, and the 
right-of-way for ingress and egress to any point of operations. If 
Lessee and surface owner are unable to agree as to the routing of 
pipelines, electric lines, etc., said routing shall be set by the 
Superintendent. The right to use water for lease operations is 
established by Sec. 226.24. Lessee shall conduct his/her operations in a 
workmanlike manner, commit no waste and allow none to be committed upon 
the land, nor permit any unavoidable nuisance to be maintained on the 
premises under his/her control.
    (b) Before commencing a drilling operation, Lessee shall pay or 
tender to the surface owner commencement money in the amount of $25 per 
seismic shot hole and commencement money in the amount of $300 for each 
well, after which Lessee shall be entitled to immediate possession of 
the drilling site. Commencement money will not be required for the 
redrilling of a well which was originally drilled under the currently 
lease. A drilling site shall be held to the minimum area essential for 
operations and shall not exceed one and one-half acres in area unless 
authorized by the Superintendent. Commencement money shall be a credit 
toward the settlement of the total damages. Acceptance of commencement 
money by the surface owner does not affect his/her right to compensation 
for damages as described in Sec. 226.20, occasioned by the drilling and 
completion of the well for which it was paid. Since actual damage to the 
surface from operations cannot necessarily be ascertained prior to the 
completion of a well as a serviceable well or dry hole, a damage 
settlement covering the drilling operation need not be made until after 
completion of drilling operations.
    (c) Where the surface is restricted land, commencement money shall 
be paid to the Superintendent for the landowner. All other surface 
owners shall be paid or tendered such commencement money direct. Where 
such surface owners are not residents of Osage County nor have a 
representative located therein, such payment shall be made or tendered 
to the last known address of the surface owner at least 5 days before 
commencing drilling operation on any well: Provided, That should lessee 
be unable to reach the owner of the surface of the land for the purpose 
of tendering the commencement money or if the owner of the surface of 
the land shall refuse to accept the same, lessee shall deposit such 
amount with the Superintendent by check payable to the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs. The superintendent shall thereupon advise the owner of the 
surface of the land by mail at his last known address that the 
commencement money is being held for payment to him upon his written 
request.
    (d) Lessee shall also pay fees for tank sites not exceeding 50 feet 
square at the rate of $100 per tank site or other vessel: Provided, That 
no payment shall be due for a tank temporarily set on a well location 
site for drilling, completing, or testing. The sum to be paid for a tank 
occupying more than 50 feet square shall be agreed upon between the 
surface owner and lessee or, on failure to agree, the same shall be 
determined by arbitration as provided by Sec. 226.21.

<R05>
Sec. 226.20  Settlement of damages claimed.

    (a) Lessee or his authorized representative or geophysical permittee 
shall pay for all damages to growing crops, any improvements on the 
lands, and all other surface damages as may be occasioned by operations. 
Commencement money shall be a credit toward the settlement of the total 
damages occasioned by the drilling and completion of the well for which 
it was paid. Such damages shall be paid to the owner of the surface and 
by him apportioned among the parties interested in the surface, whether 
as owner, surface lessee, or otherwise, as the parties may mutually 
agree or as their interests may appear. If lessee or his authorized 
representative and surface owner are unable to agree concerning damages, 
the same shall be determined by arbitration. Nothing herein contained 
shall

[[Page 584]]

be construed to deny any party the right to file an action in a court of 
competent jurisdiction if he is dissatisfied with the amount of the 
award.
    (b) Surface owners shall notify their lessees or tenants of the 
regulations in this part and of the necessary procedure to follow in all 
cases of alleged damages. If so authorized in writing, surface lessees 
or tenants may represent the surface owners.
    (c) In settlement of damages on restricted land all sums due and 
payable shall be paid to the Superintendent for credit to the account of 
the Indian entitled thereto. The Superintendent will make the 
apportionment between the Indian landowner or owners and surface Lessee 
of record.
    (d) Any person claiming an interest in any leased tract or in 
damages thereto, must furnish to the Superintendent a statement in 
writing showing said claimed interest. Failure to furnish such statement 
shall constitute a waiver of notice and estop said person from claiming 
any part of such damages after the same shall have been disbursed.

<R05>
Sec. 226.21  Procedure for settlement of damages claimed.

    Where the surface owner or his lessee suffers damage due to the oil 
and gas operations and/or marketing of oil or gas by lessee or his 
authorized representative, the procedure for recovery shall be as 
follows:
    (a) The party or parties aggrieved shall, as soon as possible after 
the discovery of any damages, serve written notice to Lessee or his 
authorized representative as provided by Sec. 226.18. Written notice 
shall contain the nature and location of the alleged damages, the date 
of occurrence, the names of the party or parties causing said damages, 
and the amount of damages. It is not intended by this requirement to 
limit the time within which action may be brought in the courts to less 
than the 90-day period allowed by section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1929 
(45 Stat. 1478, 1479).
    (b) If the alleged damages are not adjusted at the time of such 
notice, Lessee or his authorized representative shall try to adjust the 
claim with the party or parties aggrieved within 20 days from receipt of 
the notice. If the claimant is the owner of restricted property and a 
settlement results, a copy of the settlement agreement shall be filed 
with the Superintendent. If the settlement agreement is approved by the 
Superintendent, payment shall be made to the Superintendent for the 
benefit of said claimant.
    (c) If the parties fail to adjust the claim within the 20 days 
specified, then within 10 days thereafter each of the interested parties 
shall appoint an arbitrator who immediately upon their appointment shall 
agree upon a third arbitrator. If the two arbitrators shall fail to 
agree upon a third arbitrator within 10 days, they shall immediately 
notify the parties in interest. If said parties cannot agree upon a 
third arbitrator within 5 days after receipt of such notice, the 
Superintendent shall appoint the third arbitrator.
    (d) As soon as the third arbitrator is appointed, the arbitrators 
shall meet; hear the evidence and arguments of the parties; and examine 
the lands, crops, improvements, or other property alleged to have been 
injured. Within 10 days they shall render their decision as to the 
amount of the damage due. The arbitrators shall be disinterested 
persons. The fees and expenses of the third arbitrator shall be borne 
equally by the claimant and Lessee or his authorized representative. 
Each Lessee or his authorized representative and claimant shall pay the 
fee and expenses for the arbitrator appointed by him.
    (e) When an act of an oil or gas lessee or his authorized 
representative results in injury to both the surface owner and his 
lessee, the parties aggrieved shall join in the appointment of an 
arbitrator. Where the injury complained of is chargeable to one or more 
oil or gas Lessee, or his authorized representative, such lessee or said 
representative shall join in the appointment of an arbitrator.
    (f) Any two of the arbitrators may make a decision as to the amount 
of damage due. The decision shall be in writing and forthwith shall be 
served

[[Page 585]]

upon the parties in interest. Each party shall have 90 days from the 
date the decision is served in which to file an action in a court of 
competent jurisdiction. If no such action is filed within said time and 
the award is against Lessee or his/her authorized representative, he/she 
shall pay the same, together with interest at an annual rate established 
for the Internal Revenue Service from date of award, within 10 days 
after the expiration of said period for filing an action.
    (g) Lessee or his authorized representative shall file with the 
Superintendent a report on each settlement agreement, setting out the 
nature and location of the damage, date, and amount of the settlement, 
and any other pertinent information.

    Editorial Note: At 55 FR 33115, Aug. 14, 1990, the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs published a document amending Sec. 226.21(f) by removing the 
word ``forthwith'' from the first sentence and adding the word 
``forthwith'' to follow directly after the word ``served''; however, 
because these terms do not exist in the first sentence, this amendment 
could not be incorporated.


<R05>
Sec. 226.22  Prohibition of pollution.

    (a) All operators, contractors, drillers, service companies, pipe 
pulling and salvaging contractors, or other persons, shall at all times 
conduct their operations and drill, equip, operate, produce, plug and 
abandon all wells drilled for oil or gas, service wells or exploratory 
wells (including seismic, core and stratigraphic holes) in a manner that 
will prevent pollution and the migration of oil, gas, salt water or 
other substance from one stratum into another, including any fresh water 
bearing formation.
    (b) Pits for drilling mud or deleterious substance used in the 
drilling, completion, recompletion, or workover of any well shall be 
constructed and maintained to prevent pollution of surface and 
subsurface fresh water. These pits shall be enclosed with a fence of at 
least four strands of barbed wire, or an approved substitute, stretched 
taut to adequately braced corner posts, unless the surface owner, user, 
or the Superintendent gives consent to the contrary. Immediately after 
completion of operations, pits shall be emptied and leveled unless 
otherwise requested by surface owner or user.
    (c) Drilling pits shall be adequate to contain mud and other 
material extracted from wells and shall have adequate storage to 
maintain a supply of mud for use in emergencies.
    (d) No earthen pit, except those used in the drilling, completion, 
recompletion or workover of a well, shall be constructed, enlarged, 
reconstructed or used without approval of the Superintendent. Unlined 
earthen pits shall not be used for the continued storage of salt water 
or other deleterious substances.
    (e) Deleterious fluids other than fresh water drilling fluids used 
in drilling or workover operations, which are displaced or produced in 
well completion or stimulation procedures, including but not limited to 
fracturing, acidizing, swabbing, and drill stem tests, shall be 
collected into a pit lined with plastic of at least 30 mil or a metal 
tank and maintained separately from above-mentioned drilling fluids to 
allow for separate disposal.

Sec. 226.23  Easements for wells off leased premises.

    The Superintendent, with the consent of the Osage Tribal Council, 
may grant commercial and noncommercial easements for wells off the 
leased premises to be used for purposes associated with oil and gas 
production. Rental payable to the Osage Tribe for such easements shall 
be an amount agreed to by Grantee and the Osage Tribal Council subject 
to the approval of the Superintendent. Grantee shall be responsible for 
all damages resulting from the use of such wells and settlement therefor

Sec. 226.24  Lessee's use of water.

    Lessee or his contractor may, with the approval of the 
Superintendent, use

[[Page 586]]

water from streams and natural water courses to the extent that same 
does not diminish the supply below the requirements of the surface owner 
from whose land the water is taken. Similarly, Lessee or his contractor 
may use water from reservoirs formed by the impoundment of water from 
such streams and natural water courses, provided such use does not 
exceed the quantity to which they originally would have been entitled 
had the reservoirs not been constructed. Lessee or his contractor may 
install necessary lines and other equipment within the Osage Mineral 
Estate to obtain such water. Any damage resulting from such installation 
shall be settled as provided in Sec. 226.21.


<R05>
Sec. 226.25  Gas well drilled by oil lessees and vice versa.

    Prior to drilling, the oil or gas lessee shall notify the other 
lessees of his/her intent to drill. When an oil lessee in drilling a 
well encounters a formation or zone having indications of possible gas 
production, or the gas lessee in drilling a well encounters a formation 
or zone having indication of possible oil production, he/she shall 
immediately notify the other lessee and the Superintendent. Lessee 
drilling the well shall obtain all information which a prudent operator 
utilizes to evaluate the productive capability of such formation or 
zone.
    (a) Gas well to be turned over to gas lessee. If the oil lessee 
drills a gas well, he/she shall, without removing from the well any of 
the casing or other equipment, immediately shut the well in and notify 
the gas lessee and the Superintendent. If the gas lessee does not, 
within 45 days after receiving notice and cost of drilling, elect to 
take over such well and reimburse the oil lessee the cost of drilling, 
including all damages paid and the cost in-place of casing, tubing, and 
other equipment, the oil lessee shall immediately confine the gas to the 
original stratum. The disposition of such well and the production 
therefrom shall then be subject to the approval of the Superintendent. 
In the event the oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of 
the well, such cost shall be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee 
by the Superintendent. If such apportionment is not accepted, the well 
shall be plugged by the oil and gas lessee who drilled the well.
    (b) Oil well to be turned over to oil lessee. If the gas lessee 
drills an oil well, he/she shall immediately, without removing from the 
well any of the casing or other equipment, notify the oil lessee and the 
Superintendent. If the oil lessee does not, within 45 days after receipt 
of notice and cost of drilling, elect to take over the well, he/she 
shall immediately notify the gas lessee, and the disposition of such 
well and the production therefrom shall be subject to the approval of 
the Superintendent. Should the oil lessee elect to take over the well, 
he/she shall pay the gas lessee the cost of drilling the same, including 
all damages paid and cost inplace of casing and other equipment. In the 
event the oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the 
well, such cost shall be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee by 
the Superintendent. If such apportionment is not accepted, the well 
shall be plugged by the oil and gas lessee who drilled the well.
    (c) Lands not leased. If the gas lessee shall drill an oil well upon 
lands not leased for oil purposes or vice versa, the Superintendent may, 
until such time as said lands are leased, permit the lessee who drilled 
the well to operate and market the production therefrom. When said lands 
are leased, the lessee who drilled and completed the well shall be 
reimbursed by the oil or gas lessee, for the cost of drilling said well, 
including all damages paid and the cost in-place of casing, tubing, and 
other equipment. If the lessee does not elect to take over said well as 
provided above, the disposition of such well and the production 
therefrom shall be determined by the Superintendent. In the event the 
oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, such 
cost shall be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee by the 
Superintendent. If such apportionment is not accepted, the well shall be 
plugged by the oil and gas lessee who drilled the well.

    Editorial Note: At 55 FR 33115, Aug. 14, 1990, the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs published a

[[Page 587]]

document amending Sec. 226.25(b) by removing in the third sentence the 
word ``the'' before the word ``receipt'', removing the word ``such'' 
before the word ``notice'', removing the words ``notice of the,'' and in 
the fourth sentence inserting the word ``casing'' preceding and followed 
by commas after the word ``tubing''; however, because these terms do not 
exist in the third and fourth sentences, this amendment could not be 
incorporated.


<R05>
Sec. 226.26  Determining cost of well.

    The term ``cost of drilling'' as applied where one lessee takes over 
a well drilled by another, shall include all reasonable, usual, 
necessary, and proper expenditures. A list of expenses mentioned in this 
section shall be presented to proposed purchasing lessee within 10 days 
after the completion of the well. In the event of a disagreement between 
the parties as to the charges assessed against the well that is to be 
taken over, such charges shall be determined by the Superintendent.


<R05>
Sec. 226.27  Gas for operating purposes and tribal use.

    (a) Gas to be furnished oil lessee. Lessee of a producing gas lease 
shall furnish the oil lessee sufficient gas for operating purposes at a 
rate to be agreed upon, or on failure to agree the rate shall be 
determined by the Superintendent: Provided, That the oil lessee shall at 
his own expense and risk, furnish and install the necessary connections 
to the gas lessee's well or pipeline. All such connections shall be 
reported in writing to the Superintendent.
    (b) Use of gas by Osage Tribe. (1) Gas from any well or wells shall 
be furnished any Tribal-owned building or enterprise at a rate not to 
exceed the price less royalty being received or offered by a gas 
purchaser: Provided, That such requirement shall be subject to the 
determination by the Superintendent that gas in sufficient quantities is 
available above that needed for lease operation and that no waste would 
result. In the absence of a gas purchaser the rate to be paid by the 
Osage Tribe shall be determined by the Superintendent based on prices 
being paid by purchasers in the Osage Mineral Estate. The Osage Tribe is 
to furnish all necessary material and labor for such connection with 
Lessee's gas system. The use of such gas shall be at the risk of the 
Osage Tribe at all times.
    (2) Any member of the Osage Tribe residing in Osage County and 
outside a corporate city is entitled to the use at his own expense of 
not to exceed 400,000 cubic feet of gas per calendar year for his 
principal residence at a rate not to exceed the amount paid by a gas 
purchaser plus 10 percent: Provided, That such requirement shall be 
subject to the determination by the Superintendent that gas in 
sufficient quantities is available above that needed for lease operation 
and that no waste would result. In the absence of a gas purchaser the 
amount to be paid by the Tribal member shall be determined by the 
Superintendent. Gas to Tribal members is not royalty free. The Tribal 
member is to furnish all necessary material and labor for such 
connection to Lessee's gas system, and shall maintain his own lines. The 
use of such gas shall be at the risk of the Tribal member at all times.
    (3) Gas furnished by Lessee under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this 
section may be terminated only with the approval of the Superintendent. 
Written application for termination must be made to the Superintendent 
showing justification.

                         Cessation of Operations


<R05>
Sec. 226.28  Shutdown, abandonment, and plugging of wells.

    No productive well shall be abandoned until its lack for further 
profitable production of oil and/or gas has been demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Superintendent. Lessee shall not shut down, abandon, 
or otherwise discontinue the operation or use of any well for any 
purpose without the written approval of the Superintendent. All 
applications for such approval shall be submitted to the Superintendent 
on forms furnished by him/her.
    (a) Application for authority to permanently shut down or 
discontinue use or operation of a well shall set forth justification, 
probable duration the means by which the well bore is to be protected, 
and the contemplated eventual disposition of the well. The method of 
conditioning such well shall be

[[Page 588]]

subject to the approval of the Superintendent.
    (b) Prior to permanent abandonment of any well, the oil lessee or 
the gas lessee, as the case may be, shall offer the well to the other 
for his recompletion or use under such terms as may be mutually agreed 
upon but not in conflict with the regulations. Failure of the Lessee 
receiving the offer to reply within 10 days after receipt thereof shall 
be deemed as rejection of the offer. If, after indicating acceptance, 
the two parties cannot agree on the terms of the offer within 30 days, 
the disposition of such well shall be determined by the Superintendent.
    (c) The Superintendent is authorized to shut in a lease when the 
lessee fails to comply with the terms of the lease, the regulations, 
and/or orders of the Superintendent.

<R05>
Sec. 226.29  Disposition of casings and other improvements.

    (a) Upon termination of lease, permanent improvements, unless 
otherwise provided by written agreement with the surface owner and filed 
with the Superintendent, shall remain a part of said land and become the 
property of the surface owner upon termination of the lease, other than 
by cancellation. Exceptions include personal property not limited to 
tools, tanks, pipelines, pumping and drilling equipment, derricks, 
engines, machinery, tubing, and the casings of all wells: Provided, That 
when any lease terminates, all such personal property shall be removed 
the word ``terminates''; and in the last sentence of the paragraph, 
within 90 days or such reasonable extension of time as may be granted by 
the Superintendent. Otherwise, the ownership of all casings shall revert 
to Lessor and all other personal property and permanent improvements to 
the surface owner. Nothing herein shall be construed to relieve lessee 
of responsibility for removing any such personal property or permanent 
improvements from the premises if required by the Superintendent and 
restoring the premises as nearly as practicable to the original state.
    (b) Upon cancellation of lease. When there has been a cancellation 
for cause, Lessor shall be entitled and authorized to take immediate 
possession of the lease premises and all permanent improvements and all 
other equipment necessary for the operation of the lease.
    (c) Wells to be abandoned shall be promptly plugged as prescribed by 
the Superintendent. Applications to plug shall include a statement 
affirming compliance with Sec. 226.28(b) and shall set forth reasons for 
plugging, a detailed statement of the proposed work including kind, 
location, and length of plugs (by depth), plans for mudding and 
cementing, testing, parting and removing casing, and any other pertinent 
information: Provided, That the Superintendent may give oral permission 
and instructions pending receipt of a written application to plug a 
newly drilled hole. Lessee shall remit a fee of $15 with each written 
application for authority to plug a well. This fee will be refunded if 
permission is not granted.
    (d) Lessee shall plug and fill all dry or abandoned wells in a 
manner to confine the fluid in each formation bearing fresh water, oil, 
gas, salt water, and other minerals, and to protect it against invasion 
of fluids from other sources. Mud-laden fluid, cement, and other plugs 
shall be used to fill the hole from bottom to top: Provided, That if a 
satisfactory agreement is reached between Lessee and the surface owner, 
subject to the approval of the Superintendent, Lessee may condition the 
well for use as a fresh water well and shall so indicate on the plugging 
record. The manner in which plugging material shall be introduced and 
the type of material so used shall be subject to the approval of the 
Superintendent. Within 10 days after plugging, Lessee shall file with 
the Superintendent a complete report of the plugging of each well. When 
any well is plugged and abandoned, Lessee shall, within 90 days, clean 
up the premises around such well to the satisfaction of the 
Superintendent.

otherwise, and no employee of the Interior Department shall be permitted 
to acquire any interest in such leases by ownership of stock in 
corporations having leases or in any other manner.

Sec. 227.4  Sale of oil and gas leases.

    (a) At such times and in such manner as he may deem appropriate, 
after being authorized by the Joint Business Council of the Shoshone and 
Arapahoe Tribes or its authorized representative, the superintendent 
shall publish notices at least thirty days prior to the sale, unless a 
shorter period is authorized by the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative, that oil and gas leases on specific tracts, 
each

[[Page 593]]

of which shall be in a reasonably compact body, will be offered to the 
highest responsible bidder for a bonus consideration, in addition to 
stipulated rentals and royalties. Each bid must be accompanied by a 
cashier's check, certified check, or postal money order, payable to the 
payee designated in the invitation to bid, in an amount not less than 25 
percent of the bonus bid. Within 30 days after notification of being the 
successful bidder, said bidder must remit the balance of the bonus, the 
first year's rental, and his share of the advertising costs, and shall 
file with the superintendent the lease in completed form. The 
superintendent may for good and sufficient reasons, extend the time for 
completion and submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be 
granted for remitting the balance of monies due. If the successful 
bidder fails to pay the full consideration within said period, or fails 
to file the completed lease within said period or extension thereof, or 
if the lease is disapproved through no fault of the lessor or the 
Department of the Interior, 25 percent of the bonus bid will be 
forfeited for the use and benefit of the Shoshone and Arapahoe Tribes.
    (b) All notices or advertisements of sales of oil and gas leases 
shall reserve to the Secretary of the Interior the right to reject all 
bids when in his judgment the interests of the Indians will be best 
served by so doing, and that if no satisfactory bid is received, or if 
the accepted bidder fails to complete the lease, or if the Secretary of 
the Interior shall determine that it is unwise in the interests of the 
Indians to accept the highest bid, the Secretary may readvertise such 
lease for sale, or if deemed advisable, with the consent of the tribal 
council or other governing tribal authorities, a lease may be made by 
private negotiations. The successful bidder or bidders will be required 
to pay his or their share of the advertising costs. Amounts received 
from unsuccessful bidders will be returned; but when no bid is accepted 
on a tract, the costs of advertising will be assessed against the 
applicant who requested that said tract be advertised.

representative, unless otherwise provided by law at the expiration of 
any such period. Applications for renewal of leases shall be filed with 
the superintendent within ninety days prior to the date of expiration of 
the lease. One copy of the application for renewal shall be filed by the 
applicant with the Joint Business Council of the Shoshone and Arapahoe 
Tribes and no lease shall be renewed unless the Joint Business Council 
or its authorized representative is afforded an opportunity to present 
the Council's views to the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative.
    (b) The Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative 
may execute oil and gas leases with the consent of the Joint Business 
Council or its authorized representative, and may execute renewals of 
leases after consultation with the Joint Business Council or its 
authorized representative.

<R05>
Sec. 227.7  Additional information from applicant.

    The superintendent may, either before or after approval of a lease, 
call for any additional information desired to carry out the regulations 
in this part. If a lessee shall fail to furnish the papers necessary to 
put his lease and bond in proper form for consideration, the 
superintendent shall forward such lease for disapproval.


<R05>

    The provisions of Sec. 211.6 of this chapter, or as hereafter 
amended, are applicable to leases under this part.


<R05>

lessee is a successful bidder for two or more tracts of land which are 
not contiguous, separate leases shall be executed.


<R05>
Sec. 227.10  Minerals other than oil and gas.

    Unreserved, unwithdrawn, and unallotted lands which have not been 
leased for oil and gas under the act of August 21, 1916 (39 Stat. 519) 
and which are not chiefly valuable therefor, are subject to mineral

509).


<R05>
Sec. 227.13  Vested rights to be respected.

    All drilling and other oil and natural gas developments and mining

[[Page 595]]

and natural gas from the leased premises, under the terms and conditions 
of a lease shall be performed with due regard to the rights, statutory 
and otherwise, of others, if any, who may have or who may acquire a 
lawful claim or estate to the leased premises, separate and distinct

                           Rents and Royalties


<R05>
Sec. 227.15  Manner of payment.

    All payments due the lessor shall be made to the superintendent for 
the benefit of the Shoshone Indian Tribe, in accordance with the act of 
August 21, 1916 (39 Stat. 519), and no credit will be given any lessee 
for payments made otherwise. Payments of rentals and royalties except 
the first year's rental, which shall be paid to the superintendent as 
prescribed in Sec. 227.4 shall be transmitted to the superintendent 
through the supervisor. All such payments shall be accompanied by a 
statement, in triplicate, by the lessee, showing the specific items of 
royalty or rental that the remittance is intended to cover, and payment 
of royalties on production shall be made not later than the last day of 
the calendar month following the production for which such payment is to 
be made.


<R05>
Sec. 227.16  Crediting advance annual payments.

    In the event of discovery of minerals in paying quantities all 
advance rents and advance royalties shall be allowed as credit on 
stipulated royalties as they accrue for the year for which such advance 
payments have been made. No refund of any such advance payment made 
under any lease will be allowed in the event the royalty on production 
for the year is not sufficient to equal such advance payment; nor will 
any part of the moneys so paid be refunded to the lessee because of any 
subsequent surrender or cancellation of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 227.17  Rates of rents and royalties.

    (a) The lessee shall pay, beginning with the date of execution of 
leases by the Secretary of the Interior, a rental of $1.25 per acre per 
annum in advance during the continuance thereof, together with a royalty 
of 12\1/2\ percent of the value or amount of all oil, gas, and/or 
natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and 
saved from the land leased, save and except oil and/or gas used by the 
lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease, which oil or 
gas shall be royalty free. A higher rate of royalty may be fixed by the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, prior to the 
advertisement of land for oil and gas leases. During the period of 
supervision, ``value'' for the purposes of the lease may, in the 
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be calculated on the basis 
of the highest price paid or offered (whether calculated on the basis of 
short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion 
of the oil of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or 
all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold from the field where 
the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable 
product less the content of foreign substances as determined by the 
supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the sale of 
said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, 
be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of such value. When 
paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly at such 
time as the lease provides; when royalty on oil produced is paid in 
kind, such royalty oil shall be delivered in tanks provided by the 
lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless 
otherwise agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be 
required by the lessor. The lessee shall not be required to hold such 
royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar 
month in which said oil is produced. The lessee shall be in no manner 
responsible or held liable

[[Page 596]]

for loss or destruction of such oil by causes beyond his control.
    (b) The proceeds from all leases shall be taken up in the accounts 
of the superintendent for appropriate deposit for the benefit of the 
Indians.


<R05>
Sec. 227.18  Free use of gas by lessor.

    If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's 
requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then 
the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for any desired 
school or other buildings belonging to the tribe, by making his own 
connections to a regulator installed, connected to the well and 
maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay 
royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's 
risk at all times.


<R05>
Sec. 227.19  Division orders.

    (a) Lessees may make arrangements with the purchasers of oil for the 
payment of the royalties on production to the superintendent by such 
purchasers, but such arrangements, if made, shall not operate to relieve 
a lessee from responsibility should the purchaser fail or refuse to pay 
such royalties when due. Where lessees avail themselves of this 
privilege, division orders permitting the pipeline companies or other 
purchasers of the oil to withhold the royalty interest shall be executed 
and forwarded to the supervisor for approval, as pipeline companies are 
not permitted to accept or run oil from leased Indian lands until after 
the approval of a division order showing that the lessee has a lease 
regularly approved and in effect. When the lessee company runs its own 
oil, it shall execute an intracompany division order and forward it to 
the supervisor for his consideration. The right is reserved for the 
supervisor to cancel a division order at any time or require the 
pipeline company to discontinue to run the oil of any lessee who fails 
to operate the lease properly or otherwise violates the provisions of 
the lease, of the regulations in this part, or of the operating 
regulations.
    (b) When oil is taken by authority of a division order, the lessee 
or his representatives shall be actually present when the oil is gaged 
and records are made of the temperature, gravity and impurities. The 
lessee will be held responsible for the correctness and the correct 
recording and reporting of all the foregoing measurements, which except 
lowest gage, shall be made at the time the oil is turned into the 
pipeline. Failure of the lessee to perform properly these duties will 
subject the division order to revocation.

    Cross Reference: For oil and gas operating regulations of the 
Geological Survey, see 30 CFR part 221.

                               Operations


<R05>
Sec. 227.20  Permission to start operations.

    (a) No operations will be permitted on any lease before it is 
executed by the Secretary of the Interior.
    (b) Written permission must be secured from the supervisor or his 
representative before any operations are started on the leased premises. 
After such permission is secured the operations must be in accordance 
with the operating regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the 
Interior. Copies of the regulations in this part may be secured from 
either the supervisor or the superintendent, and no operations should be 
attempted without a study of the operating regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 227.21  Restrictions on operations.

    (a) All leases issued under the provisions of the regulations in 
this part shall be subject to imposition by the Secretary of the 
Interior of such restrictions as to time or times for the drilling of 
wells and as to the production from any well or wells as in his judgment 
may be necessary or proper for the protection of the natural resources 
of the leased land and in the interest of the lessor. In the exercise of 
his judgment the Secretary of the Interior may take into consideration, 
among other things, the Federal laws, State laws, regulations by 
competent Federal or State authorities, lawful agreements among 
operators regulating either drilling or production, or both, and any 
regulatory action desired by tribal authorities.
    (b) All leases issued pursuant to the regulations in this part shall 
be subject to a co-operative or unit development

[[Page 597]]

plan affecting the leased lands if and when required by the Secretary of 
the Interior, but no lease shall participate in any cooperative or unit 
plan without prior approval of the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 227.22  Diligence and prevention of waste.

    The lessee shall exercise diligence in drilling and operating wells 
for oil and gas on the leased lands while such products can be secured 
in paying quantities; carry on all operations in a good and workmanlike 
manner in accordance with approved methods and practice, having due 
regard for the prevention of waste of oil or gas developed on the land, 
or the entrance of water through wells drilled by the lessee to the 
productive sands or oil or gas-bearing strata to the destruction or 
injury of the oil or gas deposits, the preservation and conservation of 
the property for future productive operations, and to the health and 
safety of workmen and employees; plug securely all wells before 
abandoning the same and to shut off effectually all water from the oil 
or gas-bearing strata; not drill any well within 200 feet of any house 
or barn on the premises without the lessor's written consent; carry out 
at his expense all reasonable orders and requirements of the supervisor 
relative to prevention of waste, and preservation of the property and 
the health and safety of workmen; bury all pipelines crossing tillable

casualties occasioned by causes beyond his control.


<R05>
Sec. 227.23  Wells.

    The lessee shall agree (a) to drill and produce all wells necessary 
to offset or protect the leased land from drainage by wells on adjoining 
lands not the property of the lessor, or in lieu thereof, compensate the 
lessor in full each month for the estimated loss of royalty through 
drainage: Provided, That during the period of supervision by the 
Secretary of the Interior, the necessity for offset wells shall be 
determined by the supervisor and payment in lieu of drilling and 
producing shall be with the consent of, and in an amount determined by 
the Secretary of the Interior; (b) at the election of the lessee to 
drill and produce other wells: Provided, That the right to drill and 
produce such other wells shall be subject to any system of well spacing 
or production allotments authorized and approved under the applicable 
law or regulations, approved by the Secretary of the Interior and 
affecting the field or area in which the leased lands are situated; and 
(c) if the lessee elects not to drill and produce such other wells for 
any period the Secretary of the Interior may, within 10 days after due 
notice in writing, either require the drilling and production of such 
wells to the number necessary, in his opinion, to insure reasonable 
diligence in the development and operation of the property, or may in 
lieu of such additional diligent drilling and production require the 
payment on and after the first anniversary date of the lease of not to 
exceed $1 per acre per annum, which sum shall be in addition to any 
rental or royalty herein specified.


<R05>
Sec. 227.24  Penalties.

    Failure of the lessee to comply with any provisions of the lease, of 
the operating regulations, of the regulations in this part, orders of 
the superintendent or his representative, or of the orders of the 
supervisor or his representative, shall subject the lessee to a penalty 
of not more than $500 per day for each day the terms of the lease, the 
regulations, or such orders are violated: Provided, That the lessee 
shall be entitled to notice, and hearing within 30 days after such 
notice, with respect to the terms of the lease, regulations, or orders 
violated, which hearing shall be held by the supervisor, whose findings 
shall be conclusive unless an appeal be taken to the Secretary of the 
Interior within 30 days after notice of the supervisor's decision, and 
the decision of the Secretary of the Interior upon appeal shall be 
conclusive.

[[Page 598]]

authorized representative of the Interior Department to enter, from time 
to time, upon and into all parts of the leased premises for the purposes

of all operations and make reports thereof, as required by the 
applicable regulations of the Department; and their books and records, 
showing manner of operations and persons interested, shall be open at 
all times for examination of such officers of the Department as shall be 
instructed in writing by the Secretary of the Interior or authorized by 
regulations, to make such examination.


<R05>
Sec. 227.26  Assignments and overriding royalties.

    (a) Leases, or any interest therein, may be assigned or transferred 
only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and to procure 
such approval the assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under 
existing rules and regulations, and shall furnish a satisfactory bond 
for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof. No 
lease or any interest therein, or the use of such lease, shall be 
assigned, sublet, or transferred directly or indirectly, by working or 
drilling contract, or otherwise without the consent of the Secretary of 
the Interior. Assignments of leases shall be filed with the 
superintendent within 20 days after the date of execution.

    (b) Trap fishing sites; number and location. During 1963, and until 
the Secretary of the Interior or his duly authorized representative 
determines otherwise, the Metlakatla Indian Community is permitted to 
operate not more than one trap per site for salmon fishing at any four

in any part of the following area: from the point at which meridian 
132<SUP> deg.</SUP>17'30'', thence due east along said parallel to 
longitude 130<SUP> deg.</SUP>49'15'', then due south along said meridian 
to the point at which it intersects with the United States-Canadian

provided, however, that the Secretary or his duly authorized 
representative may upon request by the Metlakatla Indian Community, 
authorize fishing for salmon with traps, at such other times as he shall 
prescribe, which authorization shall be based upon the following 
criteria:
    (1) Number of fish required for spawning escapement and any other 
requirements reasonable and necessary for conservation;
    (2) Fair and equitable sharing of the salmon resource with other 
user groups fishing in State waters under State law and within the State

one.
    (3) Method of closing. The tunnel walls shall be overlapped as far 
as possible across the pot gap and the draw line shall be pulled tight 
and both secured so as to completely close the tunnel. In addition, 25 
feet of the webbing of the heart on each side next to the pot shall be 
lifted or lowered in such manner as to permit the free passage of fish.
    (e) Other forms of commercial fishing. All commercial fishing, other 
than with traps, shall be in accordance with the season and gear 
restrictions established by rule or regulation by the Alaska Board of 
Fish and Game for Commercial Fishing in any part of the previously 
defined area; provided, however, that the Secretary or his duly 
authorized representative may, upon request by the Metlakatla Indian 
Community authorize such other commercial fishing at such times as he 
shall prescribe, which authorization shall be based upon the following 
criteria:
    (1) Number of fish required for spawning escapement and any other 
requirements reasonable and necessary for conservation;
    (2) Fair and equitable sharing of the fishery resource with other 
user groups fishing in State waters under State law and within the State 
fisheries management system; and
    (3) The Federal purpose in the establishment and maintenance of the

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 249.1  Purpose.

    (a) The purposes of these regulations (part 249) are:
    (1) To assist in protecting the off-reservation nonexclusive fishing 
rights which are secured to certain Indian tribes by their treaties with 
the United States;
    (2) To promote the proper management, conservation and protection of 
fisheries resources which are subject to such treaties of the United 
States;
    (3) To provide for determination of restrictions on the manner of 
exercising nonexclusive fishing privileges under rights secured to 
Indian tribes by such treaties of the United States necessary for 
conservation of the fisheries resources;
    (4) To assist in the orderly administration of Indian Affairs;
    (5) To encourage consultation and cooperation between the states and 
Indian tribes in the management and improvement of fisheries resources 
affected by such treaties;
    (6) To assist the states in enforcing their laws and regulations for 
the management and conservation of fisheries resources in a manner 
compatible with the treaties of the United States which are applicable 
to such resources.
    (b) The conservation regulations of this part 249 are found to be 
necessary to assure that the nonexclusive rights secured to certain 
Indian tribes by treaties of the United States to fish at usual and 
accustomed places outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation shall 
be protected and preserved for the benefit of present and future members 
of such tribes in a manner consistent with the nonexclusive character of 
such rights. Any exercise of an Indian off-reservation treaty fishing 
right shall be in accordance with this part and any applicable area 
regulations issued hereunder.

<R05>
Sec. 249.2  Area regulations.

    (a) The Secretary of the Interior may upon request of an Indian 
tribe, request of a State Governor, or upon his own motion, and upon 
finding that Federal regulation of Indian fishing in any waters in which 
Indians have a treaty-secured nonexclusive fishing right is necessary to 
assure the conservation and wise utilization of the fishery resources 
for the present and future use and enjoyment of the Indians and other 
persons entitled thereto, promulgate regulations to govern the exercise 
of such treaty-secured fishing right in such waters for the purpose of 
preventing, in conjunction with appropriate State conservation laws and 
regulations governing fishing by persons not fishing under treaty 
rights, the deterioration of the fishery resources.
    (b) In formulating such regulations the Secretary of the Interior 
may incorporate such State laws or regulations, or such tribal 
regulations as have been approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
as he finds to be consistent with the Indians' rights under the Treaty 
and the conservation of the fishery resources.
    (c) Before promulgating such regulations the Secretary of the 
Interior will seek the views of the affected Indian tribes, of the fish 
or game management agency or agencies of any affected State, and of 
other interested persons. Except in emergencies where the Secretary 
finds that the exigencies require the promulgation of regulations to be

[[Page 608]]

effective immediately, a notice of proposed rule making will be 
published in the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 to 
afford an opportunity to submit comments and information, at such times 
and in such manner as may be specified in the notice. In the event of 
the emergency promulgation of regulations, interested persons will be 
afforded, as soon as possible, an opportunity to request amendment or 
revocation thereof.
    (d) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section shall contain 
provisions for invoking emergency closures or restrictions or the 
relaxation thereof at the field level when necessary or appropriate to 
meet conditions not foreseeable at the time the regulations were issued.
    (e) Regulations issued pursuant to this Sec. 249.2 may include such 
requirements for recording and reporting catch statistics as the 
appropriate state fish and game agencies or the Secretary of the 
Interior deem necessary for effective fishery management.


<R05>
Sec. 249.3  Identification cards.

    (a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall arrange for the 
issuance of an appropriate identification card to any Indian entitled 
thereto as prima facie evidence that the authorized holder thereof is 
entitled to exercise the fishing rights secured by the treaty designated 
thereon. The Commissioner may cause a federal card to be issued for this 
purpose or may authorize the issuance of cards by proper tribal 
authorities: Provided, That any such tribal cards shall be countersigned 
by an authorized officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs certifying that 
the person named on the card is a member of the tribe issuing such card 
and that said tribe is recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as 
having fishing rights under the treaty specified on such card. Copies of 
the form of any identification card authorized pursuant to this section 
and a list of the authorized Bureau of Indian Affairs issuing or 
countersigning officials shall be furnished to the fisheries management 
and enforcement agencies of any State in which such fishing rights may 
be exercised.
    (b) No such card shall be issued to any Indian who is not on the 
official membership roll of the tribe which has been approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior. Provided, That until further notice, a 
temporary card may be issued to any member of a tribe not having an 
approved current membership roll who submits evidence of his/her 
entitlement thereto satisfactory to the issuing officer and, in the case 
of a tribally issued card, to the countersigning officer. Any Indian 
claiming to have been wrongfully denied a card may appeal the decision 
in accordance with part 2 of this chapter.
    (c) No person shall be issued an identification card on the basis of 
membership in more than one tribe at any one time.
    (d) Each card shall state the name, address, tribal affiliation and 
enrollment number (if any) of the holder, identify the treaty under 
which the holder is entitled to fishing rights, contain such additional 
personal identification data as is required on fishing licenses issued 
under the law of the State or States within which it is used, and be 
signed by the issuing officer and by the holder.
    (e) No charge or fee of any kind shall be imposed by the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the issuance of an identification 
card hereunder: Provided, That this shall not prevent any Indian tribe 
from imposing any fee or tax which it may otherwise be authorized to 
impose upon the exercise of any tribal fishing right.
    (f) All cards issued by the Commisssioner of Indian Affairs pursuant 
to this part 249 shall be and remain the property of the United States 
and may be retaken by any Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer 
from any unauthorized holder. Any card so retaken shall be immediately 
forwarded to the officer who issued it.
    (g) The failure of any person who claims to be entitled to the 
benefits of a treaty fishing right to have such a card in his immediate 
personal possession while fishing or engaging in other activity in the 
claimed exercise of such right to display it upon request to any 
Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer shall be prima facie 
evidence

[[Page 609]]

that the person is not entitled to exercise an Indian fishing right 
under a treaty of the United States.
    (h) No person shall allow any use of his identification card by any 
other person.

<R05>
Sec. 249.4  Identification of fishing equipment.

    All fishing gear or other equipment used in the exercise of any off-
reservation treaty fishing right shall be marked in such manner as shall 
be prescribed in regulations issued pursuant to Sec. 249.2 hereof to 
disclose the identity of its owner or user. In the absence of proof to 
the contrary, any fishing gear which is not so marked or labeled shall 
be presumed not to be used in the exercise of an off-reservation treaty 
fishing right and shall be subject to control or seizure under State 
law.


<R05>
Sec. 249.5  Use of unauthorized helpers or agents.

    No Indian shall, while exercising off-reservations treaty-secured 
fishing rights, permit any person 12 years of age or older other than 
the authorized holder of a currently valid identification card issued 
pursuant to this part 249 to fish for him, assist him in fishing, or use 
any gear of fishing location identified as his gear or location pursuant 
to this part 249.


<R05>
Sec. 249.6  Enforcement and penalties.

    (a) Any Indian tribe with a tribal court may confer jurisdiction 
upon such court to punish violations by its members of this part 249 or 
of the area regulations issued pursuant thereto. Jurisdiction is hereby 
conferred upon each Court of Indian Offenses established pursuant to 
part 11 of this chapter to punish such violations by members of tribes 
whose reservations are under the jurisdiction of such court. Courts of 
Indian Fishing Offenses may be created pursuant to part 11 of this 
chapter to punish such violations by members of any tribe or group of 
tribes for which there is otherwise no Court of Indian Offenses or 
tribal court with jurisdiction to enforce this part 249. The provisions 
of part 11 of this chapter shall apply to any such court with respect to 
the exercise of its jurisdiction to enforce this part 249. All 
jurisdiction conferred by this section shall apply without regard to any 
territorial limitations otherwise applicable to the jurisdiction of such 
court.
    (b) Acceptance or use of an identification card issued pursuant to 
this part 249 or use of any fishing gear marked or identified pursuant 
thereto shall constitute an acknowledgment that the fishing done under 
such card or with such gear is in the claimed exercise of a tribal 
fishing right and is subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal court, 
Court of Indian Offenses, or Court of Indian Fishing Offenses. Except as 
may be otherwise provided by tribal regulations approved by or on behalf 
of the Secretary of the Interior, any person claiming to be exercising 
such tribal right and fishing in violation of the regulations contained 
in or issued under this part 249 may be punished by a fine of not to 
exceed $500, imprisonment of not to exceed 6 months, or both, and shall 
have his tribal fishing privileges suspended for not less than 5 days 
for any violation of this part 249 or of any area regulation issued 
pursuant thereto. The court shall impound the fishing rights 
identification card of any person for the period which the fishing 
privileges are suspended.


<R05>
Sec. 249.7  Savings provisions.

    Nothing in this part 249 shall be deemed to:
    (a) Prohibit or restrict any persons from engaging in any fishing 
activity in any manner which is permitted under state law;
    (b) Deprive any Indian tribe, band, or group of any right which may 
be secured it by any treaty or other law of the United States;
    (c) Permit any Indian to exercise any tribal fishing right in any 
manner prohibited by any ordinance or regulation of his tribe;
    (d) Enlarge the right, privilege, or immunity of any person to 
engage in any fishing activity beyond that granted or reserved by treaty 
with the United States;

[[Page 610]]

    (e) Exempt any person or any fishing gear, equipment, boat, vehicle, 
fish or fish products, or other property from the requirements of any 
law or regulation pertaining to safety, obstruction of navigable waters, 
national defense, security of public property, pollution, health and 
sanitation, or registration of boats or vehicles;
    (f) Abrogate or modify the effect of any agreement affecting fishing 
practices entered into between any Indian tribe and the United States or 
any State or agency of either.

Sec. 256.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to prescribe the terms and conditions 
under which assistance is given to Indians under the Housing Improvement 
Program (HIP).


<R05>
Sec. 256.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part 256:

    Nonmember Indian means any person who is a member of a Federally 
recognized tribe living in another tribe's approved service area.
    Ownership means having fee title, trust title, leasehold interest, 
use permit, indefinite assignment or other exclusive possessory 
interest. In the case of Alaska, the term also includes one who the 
Superintendent determines has a reasonable prospect of becoming an 
owner, in accordance with the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688).
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior.
    Service area means reservations (former reservations in Oklahoma), 
and allotments, restricted lands, Indian-owned fee lands (including 
lands owned by Corporations established pursuant to the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act) within a geographical area designated by the 
tribe, and approved by the Area Director to which equitable services can 
be delivered.
    Standard housing means a dwelling in a condition which is decent, 
safe, and sanitary so that it meets the following minimum standards;
    (a) General construction conforms to applicable tribal, county, 
state or national codes and to appropriate building standards for the 
region.
    (b) The heating system has the capacity to maintain a minimum 
temperature of 70 degrees in the dwelling during the coldest weather in 
the area. It must be safe to operate and maintain and deliver a uniform 
distribution of heat.
    (c) The plumbing system includes a properly installed system of 
piping and fixtures.
    (d) The electrical system includes wiring and equipment properly 
installed to safely supply electrical energy for lighting and for the 
operation of appliances.
    (e) Occupants per dwelling do not exceed these limits:

[[Page 612]]

    (1) Two-bedroom dwelling: Up to four persons;
    (2) Three-bedroom dwelling: Up to seven persons;
    (3) Four-bedroom dwelling: Adequate for all but the very largest 
families.
    (f) Bedroom size: The first bedroom must have at least 120 sq. ft. 
of floor space, additional bedrooms must have a minimum of 100 sq. ft. 
of floor space each.
    (g) Two exceptions to standard housing will be permitted:
    (1) Where one or more of the utilities are not available and there 
is no prospect of the utilities becoming available; and
    (2) In areas of severe climate, house size may be reduced to meet 
applicable building standards of the region.
    (g) The house site must be chosen so that access to utilities is 
most economical, the ingress and egress are adequate and aesthetics and 
proximity to school bus routes are considered.
    Superintendent means the Officer in charge of the Agency or other 
local office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    Tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nation, rancheria, pueblo, 
colony, or community, including any Alaska Native village which is 
federally recognized as eligible by the United States Government for the 
special programs and services provided by the Secretary to Indian tribes 
because of their status as Indians.


<R05>
Sec. 256.3  Policy.

    (a) The Bureau of Indian Affairs' housing policy is consistent with 
the specific objectives of the national housing policy which declares 
that every American family should have the opportunity for a decent home 
and suitable living environment. To the maximum extent possible, tribes 
will be involved in the administration of the program.
    (b) Every Indian, as defined in Sec. 256.2 and eligible pursuant to 
Sec. 256.6, is entitled to participate in this program irrespective of 
tribal affiliation, provided equitable services can be delivered to the 
geographic area within which they reside.
    (c) The general distribution of HIP funds among tribes is based on a 
consistent, valid, and certified inventory of tribal housing needs, a 
viable work plan, and the tribe being in compliance with the intent of 
the program. Every effort will be made to use HIP funds in conjunction 
with other programs so that the result will be a greater amount of 
housing improvements than would otherwise be possible with the HIP funds 
alone. An example of this is the agreement with the Indian Health 
Services to provide water and sanitation facilities for HIP houses. In 
cases where training programs are used in conjunction with the HIP, 
funds are to be limited to the purchase of materials, and to the 
provision of inspection and skilled labor which are otherwise not 
available.
    (d) Tribal allocation levels are determined on the basis of the 
HIP's responsibility of the total housing needs derived from the tribal 
inventories of need. The emphasis of the HIP will be on repair and 
renovation of existing housing while other federally-assisted programs 
are responsible for the bulk of the new house building effort. As such, 
the BIA's funding calculations are based on 90% of the repair need and 
up to 10% of the new construction need indicated by tribal housing 
inventories. (The exception is Alaska, where the percentage is 95% of 
repairs and 35% of new construction). The HIP may provide a grant for 
the financing of the construction of a limited amount of new standard 
housing when it is established that the applicant has been denied 
housing assistance from sources other than the HIP. Thus, each fiscal 
year, the BIA will allocate funds appropriated for HIP in proportion to 
the identified housing needs.


<R05>
Sec. 256.4  Program categories.

    The HIP will provide assistance in the following categories:
    (a) Repairs that will remain nonstandard. Under this category:
    (1) Financial assistance will be granted to finance repairs and 
additions to existing substandard housing needing replacement so that it 
is safe, more sanitary, and livable until such time as standard housing 
is available.
    (2) The standard to be applied in deciding whether to provide 
assistance is improvement in the condition of the

[[Page 613]]

house, i.e., improved livability or reduced health and safety hazards, 
even though it may be obvious that such an undertaking will not improve 
the house to the extent that it will meet the standard of decent, safe, 
and sanitary. Examples of the improvement that may be undertaken are: 
Weather tightening and the repair of doors, windows, roof, electrical 
wiring, plumbing, and chimney.
    (3) The cumulative total expenditure of the HIP funds shall not 
exceed $2,500 for any one dwelling.
    (4) The funds shall be granted and no restrictions on the use of the 
home may be imposed.
    (b) Repairs to housing that will become standard. Under this 
category:
    (1) Financial assistance will be granted to finance repairs, 
renovation and/or enlargement of existing structurally sound, but 
deteriorated dwellings which can economically be placed in a standard 
condition.
    (2) Upon completion of work, the dwelling shall fit the definition 
of standard housing as defined in Sec. 256.2.
    (3) The total expenditure of the HIP Program Funds shall not exceed 
$20,000 for any one dwelling. (In the case of Alaska, reasonable, 
substantiated freight costs in accordance with Federal Property 
Management Regulation (FPMR) 101-40, not to exceed 100% of the material 
cost, may be added).
    (4) Undertakings under this category are for applicants who are 
living in their own homes.
    (5) The applicant must sign a written agreement that if he/she sells 
the house within five years following the date of completion of the 
repairs, the grant will be voided and the grantee will repay the full 
amount of the grant at the time of settlement to the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs.
    (c) Down payments. Under this category:
    (1) The HIP provides grants in order to make the applicant eligible 
to receive housing loans from tribal, Federal or other sources of 
credit. The applicant must establish that he/she has an inadequate 
income of limited financial resources to meet the full cost of the loan. 
Grants are only for standard housing.
    (2) The grant shall not exceed the amount necessary to secure the 
loan plus the closing costs or ten percent (10%) of the purchase price 
of the house plus the closing costs or $5,000, whichever is less. (In 
the case of Alaska, the grant amount shall not exceed $6,000).
    (3) The method of advancing the grant must ensure that the funds are 
used for the purpose intended. The applicant must sign a written 
agreement that if he/she sells the house within five years following the 
date of purchase, the grant is voided and the amount of the grant will 
be fully repaid by the grantee to the Bureau of Indian Affairs at time 
of settlement.
    (d) New housing. Under this category:
    (1) The HIP may provide a grant for the financing of the 
construction of a limited amount of new standard housing, either site-
built or factory-built, when it is established that the applicant has 
been denied housing assistance from sources other than the HIP.
    (2) The housing provided under this category must meet the housing 
standards of this part. Mobile units with an integral frame are 
specifically excluded.
    (3) The total expenditure of HIP funds shall not exceed $45,000 for 
a dwelling and equipment. (In the case of Alaska, the total expenditure 
of funds shall not exceed $55,000, plus reasonable, substantiated 
freight costs in accordance with FPMR 101-40, not to exceed 100% of the 
materials cost). The occupant will be responsible for all maintenance of 
the completed dwelling and all utility fees, deposits or costs required 
for service.
    (4) The applicant must have ownership of the land on which the house 
is located. In the case of a leasehold interest, it must be for not less 
than 25 years. The applicant must sign a written agreement that if he/
she sells the house within the first ten years from the date of 
ownership, the grant is voided and the full amount of the HIP grant will 
be repaid by the grantee to the Bureau of Indian Affairs at time of 
settlement. Subsequent to the first ten years, if the grantee sells the 
house, he/she may retain 10% of the original grant amount per year 
beginning in the eleventh year, with the remaining amount to be repaid 
to the Bureau of

[[Page 614]]

Indian Affairs. If the sale occurs twenty years or more after the date 
of ownership, no repayment of any part of the grant will be due the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    (5) Adequate fire insurance, where determined feasible, must be 
carried.


<R05>
Sec. 256.5  HIP application.

    Individuals wishing to participate in the Housing Improvement 
Program must fill out BIA Form 6407. Application forms may be obtained 
from tribes or the nearest Bureau of Indian Affairs Office. Completed 
applications should be submitted to tribes or the nearest BIA office, 
where applicable. Each application for assistance should be approved by 
the tribe. Nonmember Indians apply for assistance through the tribe in 
whose jurisdiction they reside.


<R05>
Sec. 256.6  Eligibility.

    (a) To establish eligibility for selection to receive a grant under 
Sec. 256.7, an applicant must show that:
    (1) The applicant is an Indian.
    (2) The present housing of the applicant is substandard or 
inadequate in terms of capacity to meet the physical needs of the 
family.
    (3) The applicant has been denied, or is ineligible for, housing 
assistance from sources other than the HIP.
    (4) The economic resources of the applicant are inadequate or 
factors exist which make the applicant unable to obtain housing from 
other local, state or Federal sources. Applicants whose annual income 
exceeds the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Income 
Guidelines by 225% or more shall be ineligible for HIP assistance on the 
basis of need. Determination of eligibility will be made on a case-by-
case basis.
    (5) The applicant for assistance under one of the categories in 
Sec. 256.4 meets the ownership requirements given under that category.
    (b) After October 1, 1986, an applicant may only receive assistance 
once under categories given in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of Sec. 256.4.
    (c) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) financed 
houses under the administration of an Indian Housing Authority (IHA) 
will not be eligible for assistance until the end of the entire project 
indebtedness to the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 256.7  HIP selection criteria.

    Once the eligibility requirements of Sec. 256.6 are satisfied, 
development of priority lists of eligible applicants shall be 
accomplished by a ranking system based on six basic factors of need: 
Annual income, family size, overcrowded living conditions, age, handicap 
or disability, and HUD-IHA financed housing. Eligible applicants may 
receive points for any or all of these six factors. Priority will be 
given relative to the number of points received. Appendix A to this 
provides a summary of selection criteria.
    (a) Factor No. 1--Annual Household Income (Up to 40 points 
available).
    (1) The eligible applicant's total annual household income and other 
resources, if any, must be evaluated in order to determine priority in 
terms of degree of poverty. If an individual is counted as a family 
member for the purpose of determining Family Size (Factor No. 2), the 
annual income of that person must be included in the total annual 
household income on the HIP application. Examples of income which must 
be included are royalties and onetime income. A specific definition of 
the type of resources which must be included is set forth in 25 CFR part 
20.
    (2) In order to determine whether or not the applicant is entitled 
to points under Factor No. 1, it is necessary to compare the total 
combined annual household income against the Federal Poverty Income 
Guidelines which are published annually by the Department of Health and 
Human Services. The most current issue of the Guidelines published in 
the Federal Register by Health and Human Services (HHS) will be used 
during the selection process. A yardstick for determining applicant 
income priority is provided based upon 125% of the Poverty Income 
Guidelines. In addition, even greater point values are available for 
applicants whose annual income falls substantially (25% or more) below 
the poverty level. In order to facilitate calculations, a chart of the 
various income levels is provided

[[Page 615]]

to each tribe annually upon publication of new revised Poverty 
Guidelines by HHS each year.
    (b) Factor No. 2--Family Size (5 points per dependent child). A 
dependent child for purposes of this subsection is a person meeting the 
definition of ``child'' in 25 CFR part 20.
    (c) Factor No. 3--Overcrowded Living Conditions (Up to 10 points 
possible).
    (1) The definition of ``standard housing'' identifies the acceptable 
limits for family size per dwelling (see Sec. 256.2). In order to earn 
points under Factor No. 3, the applicant family must exceed the limits 
for its dwelling established in Sec. 256.2. A family is overcrowded if:
    (i) Three or more persons occupy a one-bedroom dwelling.
    (ii) Five or more persons occupy a two-bedroom dwelling.
    (iii) Eight or more persons occupy a three-bedroom dwelling.
    (2) Depending upon the circumstances and the degree of overcrowding, 
as well as the family structure, the committee reviewing HIP 
applications can award as little as 1 point, or as many as 10 points, 
for the overcrowding factor.
    (3) The preceding overcrowded living description is not feasible in 
Alaska where, because of the unique climatic conditions, a dwelling is 
frequently not divided into the conventional room arrangement customary 
in the contiguous 48 states. Recommended guidelines for Alaska only are 
therefore based upon gross square feet per occupant, ranging from 2 to 
10 points for Factor No. 3. (See appendix A to this part.)
    (d) Factor No. 4--Age--(1) Elderly couple. (Up to 21 points per 
individual available.) Points are awarded based upon age, beginning at 
age 55, with a maximum of 21 points per elderly person available. 
Appendix B to this part is a schedule, by age, of the number of points 
to be awarded in this category. If an applicant family has an elderly 
relative who is a permanent household member, points are added to the 
application for this person.
    (2) Single, Elderly, Living Alone (Up to 32 points). Special 
priority amounting to 150% of the Factor No. 4 standard schedule, as 
identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, is provided only for an 
elderly individual living alone and applying for a grant from HIP. An 
elderly widower/widow, age 70, living by him/herself plus 50% (8 points) 
adds up to a total of 24 points. In calculating allowable points using 
the schedule shown in appendix B, decimals should be eliminated by 
rounding to the next higher whole number.
    (e) Factor No. 5--Handicap or Disability (Up to 20 points available 
per application).
    (1) The many and varied degrees and types of disability present a 
complex ranking situation. A general definition of handicapped is 
provided as a guide. The selection committee evaluating HIP applications 
shall determine the number of points, up to the maximum of 20, merited 
by the applicant (or family member) based upon the degree of disability.
    (2) Applicants should provide as much documentation as possible 
concerning the disabled person's condition. This could include a 
doctor's certification, Veteran's Administration determination, Social 
Security determination of degree of disability, or similar information 
which would assist the HIP committee in its point calculation.
    (f) Factor No. 6--HUD/IHA Financed Houses (Deduct 30 points). A 
deduction of 30 points shall be applied to applicants who own HUD-IHA 
houses after the project indebtedness ends, as described in 
Sec. 256.6(c). These houses represent new standard housing obtained with 
Federal housing assistance.
    (g) Tie Breaker. If two applications are assigned the same number of 
points, two considerations will determine which application has 
priority.
    (1) Tie Breaker No. 1--The applicant living in the most dilapidated 
conditions will receive priority.
    (2) Tie Breaker No. 2--The family with the lower income will be 
served first.


<R05>
Sec. 256.8  Program implementation.

    The HIP will be implemented either by means of Pub. L. 93-638 
contracts with the tribes, or administered directly by BIA, according to 
the HIP plans and priority of the tribe served. The HIP consists of two 
parts: Receipt, review, and screening of applications

[[Page 616]]

submitted by Indians for housing assistance, determination of 
eligibility, and development of applicant priority lists; and design, 
construction, and repair/renovation of dwelling units. The 
implementation of HIP will be accomplished as follows:
    (a) Develop and maintain a consistent and valid tribal inventory of 
needs.
    (b) Select families and/or individuals for assistance. To accomplish 
this task:
    (1) A current inventory of HIP applicants shall be developed.
    (2) All HIP applications shall be received, reviewed, and screened.
    (3) The BIA will ensure that HIP applications contain adequate 
information to determine eligibility. At a minimum, each application 
must include the information required in Sec. 256.6, i.e., name, family 
size, income, and financial status, condition of present housing, the 
type of housing assistance requested (Category A, B, C or D).
    (4) A determination shall be made as to which HIP applicants are 
eligible to receive assistance and a priority list of applicants 
developed in accordance with the HIP Selection Criteria under 
Sec. 256.7.
    (5) The type of assistance to be provided each selected applicant, 
the estimated cost, and construction schedule thereof shall be 
determined.
    (c) Applicant case file. A case file shall be kept on each approved 
applicant. The case file shall contain at a minimum:
    (1) Tribal enrollment information.
    (2) The condition of existing housing.
    (3) Family size and composition.
    (4) Income.
    (5) Evidence of the inability of the applicant to secure housing 
from other sources.
    (6) Evidence that the applicant has not received HIP assistance 
after October 1, 1986.

The case file shall become a part of the record and must be retained for 
at least three years after the completion of the project.
    (d) Construction work plan--Repair and renovation of existing 
housing or construction of new housing. A work plan shall be prepared 
specifying, by HIP Categories, the number of housing units to be 
repaired, renovated or built new. The repair, renovation, and new 
housing construction work shown on the plan must be consistent with the 
housing assistance work specified on the priority list for each 
applicant. The plan shall include the following:
    (1) Category A Nonstandard Repairs. This category shall include a 
description of each repair to be performed, the cost estimate for each 
repair, the location of each unit to be repaired, a schedule, and the 
name of each applicant that is receiving this assistance.
    (2) Category B Standard Repairs and Category D New Housing. This 
category shall include location of each unit to be repaired or built 
new, and the names of applicants to receive these units. In addition, 
for Category B repairs and Category D new housing, the plan shall also 
include preliminary drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and a 
phased construction schedule for each unit to be repaired, renovated, or 
built new. Drawings should fix and illustrate what is required to repair 
or build new houses by providing, when applicable: A design, elevations, 
unit and room total square feet, general construction, placement of 
heating mechanical, electrical, and utility systems, site layout for 
grading and utility distribution. Specifications should describe clearly 
the scope of work to repair or build a new house, the workmanship 
involved, and a statement describing the quality of materials.
    (3) Category C Down Payments. This category shall include a 
description and location of the house to be purchased, verification of 
the applicant's intent to purchase a standard house, the sale price of 
the house, and a verification by the lender as to the amount of down 
payment and closing costs required for the applicant to qualify for the 
loan.
    (e) Construction start and completion dates. An anticipated 
construction start and completion date for each repair and new 
construction project to be performed shall be established. The 
construction start time should consider such factors as weather, 
location, family participation, availability of materials, and site 
preparation. All HIP recipients listed on the priority list must be 
notified of the work to be performed.

[[Page 617]]

    (f) Applicable codes. Depending upon the type of construction 
involved, the appropriate local codes will be followed. If local codes 
are not available, applicable State or National codes will be followed.
    (g) Reporting requirements. Quarterly reports shall be prepared on 
construction work undertaken and expenditures related to that 
construction work. The quarterly reports are due on the 15th day after 
the end of each calendar quarter, and shall contain for each HIP grant, 
at a minimum:
    (1) Name of grantee.
    (2) Date of construction start.
    (3) Date of completion.
    (4) Cost.
    (h) The HIP will serve those eligible applicants on an approved 
priority list. Design, construction, and repair of dwelling units may be 
accomplished through:
    (1) Direct grants to individual applicants.
    (2) Contracts or grant agreements with Indian tribes.
    (3) Contracts with private Indian or non-Indian contracting firms in 
accordance with normal BIA contract procedures; or
    (4) Programs administered directly by the BIA.


<R05>
Sec. 256.9  Inspections.

    (a) The BIA is responsible for inspection or the assurance that 
there is adequate provision for inspection by BIA employees, 
contractors, or subcontractors during the course of construction. The 
BIA shall have access at all reasonable times to work under contract for 
monitoring and inspection.
    (b) Final payment for work performed will not be made until a final 
inspection is conducted by the BIA, and a determination is made that the 
work complies with all contract requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 256.10  Appeals.

    Actions taken by BIA officials may be appealed pursuant to part 2 of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 256.11  Flood disaster protection.

    No HIP funds, under Categories in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 
Sec. 256.4, will be expended in areas designated as having special flood 
hazards under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, 
87 Stat. 977), unless the requirements for suitable flood insurance are 
met.


<R05>
Sec. 256.12  Information collection.

    The information collection requirements contained in Sec. 256.5 have 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1076-0084. The information 
will be used to determine eligibility to participate in the HIP. 
Individuals who wish to participate in the HIP must contact the tribe in 
whose jurisdiction they reside, or the BIA office closest to their 
residence. Eligibility is determined based upon the criteria listed in 
Sec. 256.6. Response is required to obtain a benefit. Public reporting 
burden for this form is estimated to average thirty minutes per 
response, including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and 
maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form.

<R05>
Sec. 262.3  Consultation to determine need for a permit.

    (a) Any person, except as provided in the uniform regulations at 43 
CFR 7.5(b) through (d), who proposes to excavate or remove 
archaeological resources on Indian lands or on properties owned or 
administered by the BIA must first apply for and secure a permit under 
the Act. Procedures relating thereto are set forth in Sec. 262.5 of this 
part.
    (b) No permit under the Act, nor any other Federally issued license 
or authorization, is required for archaeological investigations that do 
not involve the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on 
these lands, except for BIA consent on properties that it owns or 
administers. Notwithstanding, persons other than those covered under 43 
CFR 7.5(b) through (d) shall, before engaging in such investigations:
    (1) Write to the head of each tribal government having jurisdiction 
over the lands where investigations are to be conducted and request that 
he or she provide, within 30 days, written information on any permit, 
license or other form of authorization the tribe might require for the 
work proposed; and
    (2) Provide the BIA Area Director with a copy of the tribe's written 
response (or a copy of the request to the tribe if 30 days have elapsed 
without any response) plus a brief but clear written description of the 
proposed work and obtain his or her written determination as to whether 
or not a permit under the Act is required. Area Directors shall provide 
determinations within 10 working days after receiving such 
documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 262.4  Activities by Indian tribes or individuals that require a permit.

    (a) No Indian tribe may, without a permit under the Act, excavate or 
remove archaeological resources on:
    (1) Lands of another Indian tribe; or
    (2) Lands of Indian individuals, except those on which the law of 
that tribe regulates such activity.
    (b) No individual Indian may, without a permit under the Act, 
excavate or remove archaeological resources on any Indian lands 
(including his or her own) other than those on which the law of the 
tribe of which he or she is a member regulates such activity.
    (c) No person, as an employee, consultant, advisor or in any other 
capacity as an agent for any Indian tribe, shall be exempt from the 
permit requirements of the Act, except in the cases listed below:
    (1) No permit shall be required if a person is a member of the tribe 
having jurisdiction over the resources in question and the law of that 
tribe regulates the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on 
its lands.
    (2) Tribal employees need not submit permit applications to the BIA 
if:
    (i) The proposed excavation or removal of archaeological resources 
is within the normal scope of their duties or otherwise carried out by 
direction of the tribal government;
    (ii) The work is on Indian lands of the tribe or on which the law of 
that tribe regulates the excavation or removal of archaeological 
resources;
    (iii) The tribe ensures that the provisions for permit issuance in 
this part and at 43 CFR part 7 have been met by other documented means; 
and
    (iv) Before beginning the work, the tribe notifies the Area Director 
about the nature and location of the proposed work and allows 10 working 
days after mailing a notification or 5 working days after an oral 
notification (provided this is documented) for the Area Director to 
respond. The Area Director need only respond when action is required 
under Sec. 262.7 of this part, and may do so either in writing or, if 
documented, orally.
    (3) Consultants, advisors, and others serving by contractual 
agreement as agents for Indian tribes may use the provisions in 
Sec. 262.5(f) of this part to expedite the process of obtaining a 
permit.
    (4) Persons serving as agents for Indian tribes as employees or by 
contractual agreement may abbreviate the consultation required in 
Sec. 262.3(b) of this part by disregarding the requirement to consult 
first with the tribe and, provided the communication is documented, by 
consulting with the Area Director orally. In these cases, the Area 
Director need only respond when a permit is deemed necessary and may do 
so either orally or in writing. If

[[Page 621]]

a response is not received within 3 working days after an oral 
description of the proposed work is made or within 7 working days after 
a written description is mailed to the Area Director, the work may 
proceed.


<R05>
Sec. 262.5  Application for permits.

    (a) Permits from the BIA shall be issued when an applicant meets the 
requirements set out in 43 CFR 7.8, and may be conditioned, modified, 
suspended, or revoked by the Area Director. Area Directors may delegate 
this authority to Agency Superintendents, but only on a permit-by-permit 
basis and only to those who have adequate professional support 
available.
    (b) Prospective applicants may obtain details on how to apply for a 
permit by contacting the Area Director, at BIA Area Offices in: 
Aberdeen, SD; Albuquerque, NM; Anadarko, OK; Arlington, VA; Billings, 
MT; Gallup, NM; Juneau, AK; Minneapolis, MN; Muskogee, OK; Phoenix, AZ;

    (c) Permit applications proposing the excavation or removal of 
archaeological resources on Indian lands shall include the following 
consent documents:
    (1) Written permission from the Indian landowner and from the tribe, 
if any, having jurisdiction over those lands. This must contain such 
terms and conditions as the landowner or tribe may request be included 
in the permit. Where the permission is from a tribe, it should either 
state that no religious or cultural site will be harmed or destroyed by 
the proposed work or specify terms and conditions that the permit must 
include in order to safeguard against such harm or destruction.
    (i) For lands of Indian tribes, permission must be granted by the 
tribe.
    (ii) For lands of Indian individuals not under tribal jurisdiction, 
permission must be granted by the owner(s), except as provided in 
Sec. 262.6.
    (iii) For lands of Indian individuals under tribal jurisdiction, 
permission must be granted by both the owner(s), except as provided in 
Sec. 262.6, and the tribe having such jurisdiction. Where an applicant 
is the owner, consent must still be obtained from the tribe.
    (iv) Where the ownership of lands of Indian individuals is multiple, 
permission must be granted by the owners of a majority of interests, 
except as provided in Sec. 262.6. The same shall apply where the 
applicant is one of the owners.
    (v) Where the terms and conditions a tribe or landowner requests be 
included in a permit are in conflict with the provisions of this or any 
other Act, with Federal regulations, or with each other, the Area 
Director may negotiate with the requestor to eliminate the conflict. If 
the conflict remains, the permit may not be issued.
    (2) Copies of any permits required by tribal law for archaeological 
work on lands under tribal jurisdiction. This may serve as written 
consent from the tribe for the purposes of Sec. 262.5(c)(1).
    (3) Written agreement by the Indian landowner(s) to release 
archaeological resources for curation or study, as specified in 
Sec. 262.8(b).
    (d) Permits issued by the BIA shall include the following or similar 
condition: ``Human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects, 
and objects of cultural patrimony may not be excavated or removed unless 
the permittee has obtained the written consent of the Area Director. In 
order to obtain consent, the permittee shall present to the Area 
Director written evidence of prior consultation with the appropriate 
Indian tribe. If the lands containing the remains or objects are tribal 
lands, the permittee shall first obtain the written consent of the tribe 
having jurisdiction over the lands.'' Determination as to which tribe is 
the appropriate tribe shall be made in accordance with Sec. 262.8(a). 
Area Director consent shall be based on the scientific appropriateness 
of the research objectives and provisions for recovery, recording, and 
analysis and may, if documented, be oral. This condition may be omitted 
from the permit when such excavation or removal is proposed, and the 
requirements of the condition are met, in the permit application.
    (e) Information and assistance in contacting Indian tribes and 
individual Indian landowners for the purpose of

[[Page 622]]

requesting the consent documents listed under paragraph (c) of this 
section or of seeking the consultation and consent required under 
paragraph (d) of this section may be obtained from the BIA office to 
which the permit application is submitted.
    (f) Contractual agreements with the BIA or Indian tribes and permits 
issued by Indian tribes may be accepted as support documents for permit 
applications. They may also double as permit documents, if they 
demonstrate that the provisions for permit issuance in this part and at 
43 CFR part 7 have been met and they are attached to a Department of the 
Interior permit form. This form must be signed by the Area Director, but 
need only contain the following or similar statement: ``This permit is 
issued to the person(s) named, and in accordance with the terms and 
conditions in the attached (contractual agreement/tribal permit).''
    (g) Area Directors shall respond to permit applications within 15 
working days of receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 262.6  Landowner consent by the Secretary.

    The Secretary of the Interior, or delegate thereof, may, on behalf 
of the owner(s) of lands of Indian individuals, grant consent for the 
purposes in Sec. 262.5(c)(1) and (3) when the Secretary or his or her 
delegate finds that such consent will not result in any injury to the 
land or owner(s) and when one or more of the following conditions exist:
    (a) The owner is a minor or a person non compos mentis;
    (b) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner have not been 
determined;
    (c) The whereabouts of the owner are unknown;
    (d) Multiple owners are so numerous that the Secretary or his or her 
delegate finds, after documenting his or her efforts to do so, that it 
would be impractical to obtain their consent, as prescribed in 
Sec. 262.5(c)(1)(iv) and provided the Secretary or his or her delegate 
also notifies, in writing, the tribe, if any, having jurisdiction over 
the land and allows 15 working days from the date of mailing date for 
response; or
    (e) The owner has given the Secretary or his or her delegate written 
authority to grant such consent on his or her behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 262.7  Notice to Indian tribes of possible harm to cultural or religious sites.

    When consent by an Indian tribe to proposed excavation or removal of 
archaeological resources from Indian lands it owns or over which it has 
jurisdiction contains all of the information written as prescribed and 
advised in Sec. 262.5(c)(1), it may be taken to mean that subject to 
such terms and conditions as the tribe might specify, issuance of a 
permit for the proposed work will not result in harm to, or destruction 
of, any site of religious or cultural importance. No further 
notification is necessary, unless the Area Director has reason to 
believe that the proposed work might harm or destroy a site of religious 
or cultural importance to another tribe or Native American group. He or 
she shall then follow the notification procedures at 43 CFR 7.7. Those 
procedures must also be followed when proposed work might affect lands 
of Indian individuals over which there is no tribal jurisdiction or 
public lands owned or administered by the BIA.


<R05>
Sec. 262.8  Custody of archaeological resources.

    (a) Archaeological resources excavated or removed from Indian lands, 
except for human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects 
and objects of cultural patrimony, remain the property of the Indian 
tribe or individual(s) having rights of ownership over such lands. 
Ownership and right of control over the disposition of the excepted 
items shall be in accordance with the order of priority provided in the 
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (Pub. L. 101-
601), adapted for the purpose of this rule as follows:
    (1) In the case of human remains of Indians and funerary objects, in 
the lineal descendants of the Indian; or
    (2) In any case in which such lineal descendants cannot be 
ascertained, and in the case of sacred objects and objects of cultural 
patrimony:

[[Page 623]]

    (i) In the Indian tribe on whose tribal lands, or on the individual 
Indian lands of whose members, such remains or objects are discovered;
    (ii) In the Indian tribe recognized as aboriginally occupying the 
public lands owned or administered by the BIA on which such remains or 
objects are discovered, if upon notice, that tribe states a claim for 
those remains or objects; or
    (iii) Where it can be so demonstrated by a preponderance of 
evidence, in the tribe other than that in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of 
this section having the strongest cultural relationship with such 
remains or objects, if, upon notice, that tribe states a claim for those 
remains or objects.
    (iv) The Area Director shall provide the required notice to any 
Indian tribe identified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this 
section, in writing, within 5 working days after such identification has 
been documented and confirmed, and shall at the same time submit a copy 
of the notice for publication in the Federal Register. This notice shall 
include a description of the remains or objects; of where, how, and why 
they were excavated or removed; and of the evidence used to identify the 
tribe being notified. The remains or objects in question shall be 
considered the property of the pertinent tribe under paragraph (a)(2)(i) 
of this section or, in the case of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, 
held and administered by the BIA until or unless a claim is stated.
    (b) No permit for the excavation or removal of archaeological 
resources on Indian lands may be issued without the written consent of 
the Indian landowner(s) either to grant custody of the resources 
recovered (other than human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred 
objects or objects of cultural patrimony) to a curatorial facility that 
meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79 or to allow the permittee a 
reasonable period of time to hold or have ready access to them at an 
appropriate location for study. The excepted remains and objects are 
covered under Sec. 262.5(d) of this part which, in general, permits 
their excavation or removal only when the research objectives and 
provisions for recovery, recording, and analysis are scientifically 
appropriate. Written consent to custody by a curatorial facility may 
include terms and conditions regarding curation (e.g., cleaning, 
viewing, loaning, studying, etc.), provided these are consistent with 36 
CFR part 79.
    (1) On lands of Indian tribes, consent must be obtained from the 
tribe.
    (2) On lands of Indian individuals, consent must be obtained from 
the owner of the land or the owners of a majority of interests therein, 
except as provided in Sec. 262.6.
    (3) Where consent is by the owners of a majority of interests, it 
must, if the archaeological resources are to be retained by or returned 
after study to the interest holders, designate a representative to 
receive those resources. Whether and how these are subsequently 
distributed among themselves is a matter for the interest holders to 
decide.
    (c) The Area Director may, after notifying the tribe (if any) having 
jurisdiction over such lands and allowing 15 working days for response, 
decline to issue a permit for lands of Indian individuals if he or she 
has any verifiable reason to believe that archaeological resources 
retained by the landowner(s) after being studied will be sold or 
exchanged other than to the tribe having jurisdiction or to a curatorial 
facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. The basis for 
decline shall be that excavation or removal of resources under such 
circumstances would not be in the public interest and would thus be 
contrary to the purposes of the Act.
    (d) The landowner(s) alone may grant custody of archaeological 
resources (except for human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects 
and objects of cultural patrimony, which are subject to the provisions 
of paragraph (a) of this section) excavated or removed from lands of 
Indian individuals that are under tribal jurisdiction to a curatorial 
facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. When, however, 
such consignment constitutes the ultimate disposition of these 
resources, the tribe having jurisdiction must also grant its consent. 
Any subsequent exchange or disposition by the facility

[[Page 624]]

must have the consent of both the landowner(s) and the tribe.

<R05>
Sec. 265.3  Roads prohibited.

    (a) Within the boundaries of this officially designated roadless 
area it will be the policy of the Interior Department to refuse consent 
to the construction or establishment of any routes passable to motor 
transportation, including in this restriction highways, roads, truck 
trails, work roads, and all other types of ways constructed to make 
possible the passage of motor vehicles either for transportation of 
people or for the hauling of supplies and equipment, unless the 
requirements of fire protection, commercial use for the Indians' benefit 
or actual needs of the Indians clearly demand otherwise.
    (b) Foot trails and horse trails are not barred. The Superintendent 
of the Wind River Reservation on which this roadless area has been 
established will be held strictly accountable for seeing that the area 
is maintained in a roadless condition. Elimination of this area or any 
part thereof from the restriction of this order will be made only upon a 
written showing of an actual and controlling need.

provide. Consistent with this concept, maximum Indian participation in 
the development, approval and implementation of all programs contracted 
under this part shall be required.


<R04>
                     Subpart B--Application Process


<R05>
Sec. 273.11  Eligible applicants.

    (a) Any State, school district, tribal organization or Indian 
corporation is eligible to apply for contracts for supplemental or 
operational support programs. For the purposes of this part, previously 
private schools as defined in Sec. 273.2(n) are considered tribal

contracts for supplemental or operational support programs as required 
in this part.

[[Page 628]]

    (c) Tribal organizations must comply with the following requirements 
to obtain contracts for supplemental programs or operational support:
    (1) The application submitted by the tribal organization shall meet 
the requirements in Sec. 273.20 in addition to those in Sec. 271.14 of 
this chapter.
    (2) The requirements in Secs. 271.1 through 271.27, 271.41 through

concerning retrocession and reassumption of programs do not apply to a 
tribal organization retroceding a contract for supplemental programs or 
operational support as the Bureau does not operate education programs 
authorized to be contracted under the Johnson-O'Malley Act. However, the 
tribal organization may retrocede such a contract and the Bureau will 
then contract with a State, school district, or Indian corporation under

at its discretion require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding 
and insurance requirements of the grantee are not deemed to be 
sufficient to protect adequately the interests of the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 276.5  Recordkeeping.

    (a) The Bureau shall not impose record retention requirements over 
and above those established by the grantee except that financial 
records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other 
records pertinent to a Bureau grant, or to any subgrant (or negotiated 
contract exceeding $2500) under a grant, shall be retained for a period 
of three years, with the following qualifications:
    (1) The records shall be retained beyond the three-year period if 
audit findings have not been resolved.
    (2) Records for nonexpendable property which was acquired with 
Bureau grant funds shall be retained for three years after its final 
disposition.
    (3) When grant records are transferred to or maintained by the 
Bureau, the three-year retention requirement is not applicable to the 
grantee.
    (b) The retention period starts from the date of submission of the 
final expenditure report or, for grants which are renewed annually, from 
the date of the submission of the annual expenditure report.
    (c) Grantees are authorized, if they desire, to substitute microfilm 
copies in lieu of original records.
    (d) The Bureau shall request transfer of certain records to its 
custody from grantees when it determines that the records possess long-
term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping 
the Bureau may make arrangements with the grantee for the grantee to 
retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use.
    (e) The Secretary of the Interior and the Comptroller General of the 
United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives shall 
have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the grantees 
and their subgrantees which are pertinent to a specific grant program 
for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, transcripts and 
copies at government expense.
    (f) Unless otherwise required by law, the Bureau shall not place 
restrictions on grantees which will limit public access to the grantee's 
records created as part of the grant except when records must remain 
confidential. Following are some of the reasons for withholding records:
    (1) Prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (2) Specifically required by statute or Executive Order to be kept 
secret;
    (3) Commercial or financial information obtained from a person or 
firm on a privileged or confidential basis.

<R05>
Sec. 276.6  Program income.

    (a) No grantee receiving a grant shall be held accountable for 
interest earned on grant funds, pending their disbursement for program 
purposes.
    (b) Proceeds from the sale of real or personal property, either 
provided by the Federal Government or purchased in whole or in part with 
Federal funds, shall be handled in accordance with Sec. 276.11.
    (c) Royalties received from copyrights and patents produced under 
the grant during the grant period shall be retained by the grantee and, 
in accordance with the grant agreement, be either added to the funds 
already committed to the program or deducted from total allowable 
project costs for the purpose of determining the net costs on which the 
Bureau share of costs will be based. After termination or completion of 
the grant, the Bureau share of royalties in excess of $200 received 
annually shall be returned to the Bureau in the absence of other 
specific agreements between the Bureau and the grantee. The Bureau share 
of royalties shall be computed on the same ratio basis as the Bureau 
share of the total project cost.
    (d) All other program income earned during the grant period shall be 
retained by the grantee and, in accordance with the grant agreement, 
shall be either:
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Bureau and the 
grantee and be used to further eligible program objectives, or
    (2) Deducted from the total project costs for the purpose of 
determining the net costs on which the Bureau share of costs will be 
based.
    (e) Grantees shall record the receipt and expenditures of revenues 
(such as taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, etc.) as a part of 
grant project transactions when such revenues are specifically earmarked 
for a grant project in accordance with grant agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 276.7  Standards for grantee financial management systems.

    (a) Grantee financial management systems for grants and subgrantee 
financial management systems for subgrants shall provide for:
    (1) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial 
results of each grant program in accordance with Federal reporting 
requirements and for each subgrant in accordance with the grantees' 
requirements. Except when specifically required by law, the Bureau wll 
not require financial reporting on the accrual basis from tribal 
organizations whose records are not maintained on that basis. However, 
when accrual reporting is required by law, tribal organizations whose 
records are not maintained on that basis will not be required to convert 
their accounting systems to the accrual basis; they may develop the 
accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on hand or 
on the basis of best estimates.
    (2) Records which identify adequately the source and application of 
funds for grant--or subgrant--supported activities. These records shall 
contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and 
authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, 
outlays, and income.
    (3) Effective control over and accountability for all grant or 
subgrant funds, and real and personal property acquired with grant or 
subgrant funds. Grantees and subgrantees shall adequately safeguard all 
such property and shall assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Comparison of actual with budgeted amounts for each grant or 
subgrant, and, when specifically required by the performance reporting 
requirements of the grant or subgrant, relation of financial information 
with performance or productivity data, including the production of unit 
cost information.
    (5) Procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of 
funds from the U.S. Treasury and the disbursement by the grantee, 
whenever funds are advanced by the Federal Government. When advances are 
made by a letter-of-credit method, the grantees shall make drawdowns 
from the U.S. Treasury as close as possible to the time of making the 
disbursements. Subgrantees shall institute similar procedures when funds 
are advanced by the grantee.

[[Page 645]]

    (6) Procedures for determining the allowability and allocability of 
costs shall be in accordance with the applicable cost principles 
prescribed in appendix A of this part.
    (7) Accounting records which are supported by source documentation.
    (8) A systematic method to assure timely and appropriate resolution 
of audit findings and recommendations.
    (b) Grantees shall require subgrantees (recipients of grants which 
are passed through by the grantee) to adopt all of the standards in 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 276.8  Financial reporting requirements.

    Requirements for grantees to report financial information to the 
Bureau, and to request advances and reimbursment when a letter of credit 
method is not used, are prescribed in appendix B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 276.9  Monitoring and reporting program performances.

    (a) Grantees shall constantly monitor the performance under grant-
supported activities to assure that adequate progress is being made 
toward achieving the goals of the grant. This review shall be made for 
each program, function, or activity of each grant as set forth in the 
approved grant application.
    (b) Grantees shall submit a performance report for each grant which 
briefly presents the following for each program, function, or activity 
involved:
    (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the goals established 
for the period. Where the output of grant programs can be readily 
quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for 
computation of unit costs.
    (2) Reasons for slippage in those cases were established goals were 
not met.
    (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (c) Grantees shall submit the performance reports to the Bureau with 
the Financial Status Reports (prescribed in appendix B of this part) in 
the frequency established by appendix B. The Bureau shall prescribe the 
frequency with which the performance reports will be submitted with the 
Request for Advance or Reimbursement (prescribed in appendix B) when 
that form is used in lieu of the Financial Status Report. In no case 
shall the performance reports be required more frequently than quarterly 
or less frequently than annually.
    (d) Between the required performance reporting dates, events may 
occur which have significant impact upon the project or program. In such 
cases, the grantee shall inform the Bureau as soon as the following 
types of conditions become known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
affect the ability to attain program objectives, prevent the meeting of 
time schedules and goals, or preclude the attainment of project work 
units by established time periods. This disclosure shall be accomplished 
by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any Bureau 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments or events which enable meeting time 
schedules and goals sooner than anticipated or producing more work units 
than originally projected.
    (e) If any performance review conducted by the grantee discloses the 
need for change in the budget estimates in accordance with the criteria 
established in Sec. 276.14, the grantee shall submit a request for 
budget revision.
    (f) The bureau shall make site visits as frequently as practicable 
to:
    (1) Review program accomplishments and management control systems.
    (2) Provide such technical assistance as may be required, or 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 276.10  Grant payment requirements.

    (a) Except for construction grants for which the letter-of-credit 
method is optional, the letter-of-credit funding method shall be used by 
the Bureau where all of the following conditions exist:
    (1) When there is or will be a continuing relationship between a 
grantee and the Bureau for at least a 12-month period and the total 
amount of advances to be received within that period from

[[Page 646]]

the Bureau is $120,000, or more, as prescribed by Treasury Circular No. 
1075.
    (2) When the grantee has established or demonstrated to the Bureau 
the willingness and ability to establish procedures that will minimize 
the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and their disbursement 
by the grantee.
    (3) When the grantee's financial management system meets the 
standards for fund control and accountability prescribed in Sec. 276.7.
    (b) The method of advancing funds by Treasury check shall be used, 
in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Circular No. 1075, when 
the grantee meets all of the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) 
and (3) of this section.
    (c) The reimbursement by Treasury check method shall be the 
preferred method when the grantee does not meet the requirements 
specified in either paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3), or both. This method may 
also be used when the major portion of the program is accomplished 
through private market financing or Federal loans, and when the Bureau 
grant assistance constitutes a minor portion of the program.
    (d) Unless otherwise required by law, the Bureau shall not withhold 
payments for proper charges made by grantees at any time during the 
grant period unless:
    (1) A grantee has failed to comply with the program objectives, 
grant award conditions, or Bureau reporting requirements; or
    (2) The grantee is indebted to the United States and collection of 
the indebtedness will not impair accomplishment of the objectives of any 
grant program sponsored by the United States. Under such conditions, the 
Bureau may, upon reasonable notice, inform the grantee that payments 
will not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until 
the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal 
Government is liquidated.
    (e) Appendix B of this part provides the procedures for requesting 
advances or reimbursements.

<R05>
Sec. 276.11  Property management standards.

    (a) Grantees may follow their own property management policies and 
procedures if they observe the requirements of this section. With 
respect to property covered by this section, the Bureau may not impose 
on grantees any requirements (including property reporting 
requirements)--not authorized by this part unless specifically required 
by Federal law.
    (b) Title to real property to be acquired in whole or in part from a 
Bureau grant under part 272 of this chapter shall vest in one of the 
following manners:
    (1) Title may be taken by the United States in trust for the Indian 
tribe upon the request of the tribe and when the real property to be 
acquired is within the reservation boundaries or adjoins on at least two 
sides other trust or restricted lands as prescribed in part 272 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Fee title to the acquired real property shall vest in the Indian 
tribe whenever the acquisition does not meet the criteria in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, unless for other reasons a tribe requests title 
to be taken in the name of the United States. In the absence of 
applicable statutory authority governing the disposition of real 
property acquired by a tribe, the tribe shall use the real property for 
the authorized purposes and in accordance with any other requirements 
imposed by the terms and conditions of the original grant. Changes in 
use compatible to other tribal programs may be authorized by the Bureau. 
When no longer needed for the authorized purposes, the real property 
shall be used in accordance with the standards set forth in 
Sec. 276.11(d)(1) for non-expendable personal property. Accordingly, the 
following priority order for use of such property shall be:
    (i) Other grants from the Bureau.
    (ii) Grants from other Federal agencies.
    (iii) Tribal purposes consistent with those authorized for support 
by Bureau grants.
    (iv) Tribal official activities.
    (3) In those instances where the Indian tribe requests, title may be 
acquired by the United States. Use of

[[Page 647]]

these acquired real property interests will be subject to the authorized 
purposes and in accordance with the provisions of the original grant. 
Upon a determination that the real property is no longer needed for the 
authorized purposes, disposition may be made by declaring it excess 
under provisions of the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 Stat. 1954) and title 
transferred to the Secretary to be held by the United States in trust 
for the tribe. Where real property does not meet the requirements under 
the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 Stat. 1954), the tribe may elect to 
acquire title under applicable enabling statutory authorities, or in the 
absence of statutory authority, request withholding disposition in aid 
of legislation, or authorize disposal under the General Services 
Administration procedures.
    (c) The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section 
shall also apply when real property is acquired in whole or in part by a 
Bureau grant other than that provided under part 272 of this chapter. 
However, when such property is acquired by a grantee other than an 
Indian tribe, or a tribal governing body, fee simple title to the 
property shall vest in the grantee upon acquisition. In the absence of 
applicable statutory provisions governing the use or disposition of such 
property, it shall be subject to the following requirments, in addition 
to any other requirements imposed by the terms and conditions of the 
grant:
    (1) The grantee shall use the real property for the authorized 
purpose of the original grant as long as needed.
    (2) The grantee shall obtain approval by the Bureau for the use of 
the real property in other projects when the grantee determines that the 
property is no longer needed for the original grant purposes. Use in 
other projects shall be limited to those under other Federal grant 
programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with those 
authorized for support by the grantor.
    (3) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the grantee shall return all 
real property furnished or purchased wholly with Bureau grant funds to 
the control of the Bureau. In the case of property purchased in part 
with Bureau grant funds, the grantee may be permitted to take title to 
the Federal interest therein upon compensating the Federal Government 
for its fair share of the property. The Federal share of the property 
shall be the amount computed by applying the percentage of the Federal 
participation in the total cost of the grant program for which the 
property was acquired to the current fair market value of the property.
    (d) Standards and procedures governing ownership, use, and 
disposition of nonexpendable personal property furnished by the Bureau 
or acquired with Bureau funds are set forth below:
    (1) Nonexpendable personal property acquired with Bureau funds. When 
nonexpendable personal property is acquired by a grantee wholly or in 
part with Bureau funds, title will not be taken by the Bureau except as 
provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section but shall be vested in 
the grantee subject to the following restrictions on use and disposition 
of the property:
    (i) The grantee shall retain the property acquired with Bureau funds 
in the grant program as long as there is a need for the property to 
accomplish the purpose of the grant program whether or not the program 
continues to be supported by Bureau funds. When there is no longer a 
need for the property to accomplish the purpose of the grant program, 
the grantee shall use the property in connection with the other Federal 
grants it has received in the following order of priority:
    (A) Other grants from the Bureau needing the property.
    (B) Grants of other Federal agencies needing the property.
    (ii) When the grantee no longer has need for the property in any of 
its Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent 
with those authorized for support by the grantor, the property may be 
used for its own official activities in accordance with the following 
standards:
    (A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of less than 
$500 and used four years or more. The grantee may use the property for 
its own official activities without reimbursement to the Federal 
government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.

[[Page 648]]

    (B) All other nonexpendable property. The grantee may retain the 
property for its own use if a fair compensation is made to the Bureau 
for the latter's share of the property. The amount of compensation shall 
be computed by applying the percentage of Bureau participation in the 
grant program to the current fair market value of the property.
    (iii) If the grantee has no need for the property, disposition of 
the property shall be made as follows:
    (A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or 
less. Except for that property which meets the criteria of paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the grantee shall sell the property and 
reimburse the Bureau an amount which is computed in accordance with 
paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (B) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of over $1,000. 
The grantee shall request disposition instructions from the Bureau. The 
Bureau shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the 
Bureau's requirement. If no requirement exists within the Bureau, the 
availability of the property shall be reported to the General Services 
Administration (GSA) by the Bureau to determine whether a requirement 
for the property exists in other Federal agencies. The Bureau shall 
issue instructions to the grantee within 120 days and the following 
procedures shall govern:
    (1) If the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the 
grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an 
amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee's 
participation in the grant program to the current fair market value of 
the property, plus any shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
    (2) If the grantee is instructed to otherwise dispose of the 
property, he shall be reimbursed by the Bureau of such costs incurred in 
its disposition.
    (3) If disposition instructions are not issued within 120 days after 
reporting, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau 
and amount which is computed by applying the percentage of Bureau 
participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. Further, the 
grantee shall be permitted to retain $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, 
whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses.
    (iv) Where the Bureau determines that property with an acquisition 
cost of $1,000 or more and financed solely with Bureau funds is unique, 
different, or costly to replace, it may reserve title to such property, 
subject to the following provisions:
    (A) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant 
agreement or otherwise made known to the grantee.
    (B) The Bureau shall issue disposition instructions within 120 days 
after the completion of the need for the property under the grant for 
which it was acquired. If the Bureau fails to issue disposition 
instructions within 120 days, the grantee shall apply the standards of 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)(B), and (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (2) Federally owned nonexpendable personal property. Unless 
statutory authority to transfer title has been granted to an agency, 
title to Federally owned property (property to which the Federal 
Government retains title including excess property made available by the 
Bureau to grantees) remains vested by law in the Federal Government. 
Upon termination of the grant or need for the property, such property 
shall be reported to the Bureau for further Bureau use or, if 
appropriate, for reporting to the General Services Administration for 
other Federal agency use. Appropriate disposition instructions will be 
issued to the grantee after completion of Bureau review.
    (e) The grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable 
personal property shall also include the following procedural 
requirements:
    (1) Property records shall be maintained accurately and provide for 
a description of the property; manufacturer's serial number or other 
identification number; acquisition date and cost; source of the 
property; percentage of Federal funds used in the purchase of property; 
location, use, and condition of the property; and ultimate disposition 
data including sales price or the

[[Page 649]]

method used to determine current fair market value if the grantee 
reimburses the bureau for its share.
    (2) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results 
reconciled with the property records at least once every two years to 
verify the existence, current use, and continued need for the property.
    (3) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft to the property. Any loss, 
damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and 
fully documented.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) Proper sales procedures shall be established for unneeded 
property which would provide for competition to the extent practicable 
and result in the highest possible return.
    (f) When the total inventory value of any unused expendable personal 
property exceeds $500 at the expiration of need for any grant purposes, 
the grantee may retain the property or sell the property as long as he 
compensates the Bureau for its share in the cost. The amount of 
compensation shall be computed in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (g) Specific standards for control of intangible property are 
provided as follows:
    (1) If any program produces patentable items, patent rights, 
processes, or inventions, in the course of work aided by a Bureau grant, 
such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Bureau. Unless 
there is prior agreement between the grantee and Bureau on disposition 
of such items, the Bureau shall determine whether protection on such 
invention or discovery shall be sought and how the rights in the 
invention or discovery--including rights under any patent issued on it--
shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public 
interest consistent with ``Government Patent Policy'' (President's 
memorandum for heads of executive departments and agencies), dated 
August 23, 1971, and Statement of Government Patent Policy as printed in 
36 FR 16889.
    (2) Where the grant results in a book or other copyrightable 
material, the author or grantee is eligible to copyright the work if it 
is found that (i) the retention of the copyright is not precluded by 
statute and (ii) equity or the public interest is best served by doing 
so, by reason of special circumstances. If it is found that the public 
interest is best served by limiting the term of any copyright to be 
obtained, such limits shall be set forth in the grant agreement. 
``Developmental'' copyrights may be requested during the development, 
testing, or evaluation of copyrightable materials in order to prevent 
them from prematurely falling into the public domain. The copyright will 
be in accordance with copyright laws. However, the Government shall 
receive a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to 
reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use the 
work for Government purposes. A copy of any copyright obtained by a 
grantee shall be provided to the Bureau. Program income received as 
royalties from copyrights on materials produced under grants is retained 
by the grantee during the grant period and is to be used according to 
the provisions of Sec. 276.6(c). Specific agreements between the Bureau 
and the grantee shall be entered into before the grant is awarded to 
determine the uses of the royalty income after the grant is completed or 
terminated.
    (h) The use of Bureau-owned facilities under the jurisdiction of the 
Commissioner by a grantee for purposes of carrying out a grant may be 
authorized when the facilities are not needed for Bureau purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 276.12  Procurement standards.

    (a) The standards contained in this section do not relieve the 
grantee of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contracts. 
The grantee is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Bureau 
regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and 
administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into, in 
support of a grant. This includes but is not limited to: disputes, 
claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a 
contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of law are

[[Page 650]]

to be referred to the tribal, Federal or other authority which has 
proper jurisdiction.
    (b) Grantees may use their own procurement regulations provided that 
procurements made with Bureau grant funds adhere to the standards set 
forth as follows:
    (1) The grantee shall maintain a code or standards of conduct which 
shall govern the performance of its officers, employees, or agents in 
contracting with and expending Bureau grant funds. Grantee's officers, 
employees or agents, shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, 
favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or potential 
contractors. To the extent permissible by law, rules or regulations, 
such standards shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other 
disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by 
either the grantee officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or 
their agents.
    (2) All procurement transactions regardless of whether negotiated or 
advertised and without regard to dollar value shall be conducted in a 
manner so as to provide maximum open and free competition. The grantee 
should be alert to organizational conflicts of interest or non-
competitive practices among contractors which may restrict or eliminate 
competition or otherwise restrain trade. However, this provision will 
apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in 
Sec. 276.13 have been met.
    (3) The grantee shall establish procurement procedures which provide 
for, as a minimum, the following procedural requirements:
    (i) Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by grantee 
official to avoid purchasing unnecessary or duplicative items. Where 
appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase 
alternatives to determine which would be the most economical, practical 
procurement.
    (ii) Invitations for bids or requests for proposals shall be based 
upon a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for 
the material, product, or service to be procured. In competitive 
procurements, such description shall not contain features which unduly 
restrict competition. ``Brand name or equal'' description may be used as 
a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a 
procurement. When so used, the specific features of the named brand 
which must be met by offerors should be clearly specified.
    (iii) Positive efforts shall be made by the grantees to use small 
business and minority-owned business sources of supplies and services. 
Such efforts should allow these sources the maximum feasible opportunity 
to compete for contracts to be performed using Bureau grant funds. 
However, this provision will apply only after the Indian preference 
requirements prescribed in Sec. 276.13 have been met.
    (iv) The type of procuring instruments used (i.e., fixed price 
contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, etc.) shall be appropriate for 
the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the 
grant program involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' method of 
contracting shall not be used.
    (v) Formal advertising, with adequate purchase description, sealed 
bids, and public openings shall be the required method of procurement 
unless negotiation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section is 
necessary to accomplish sound procurement. However, procurement of 
$10,000 or less need not be so advertised. Where such advertised bids 
are obtained the awards shall be made to the responsible bidder whose 
bid is responsive to the invitation and is most advantageous to the 
grantee, price and other factors considered. (Factors such as discounts, 
transportation costs, taxes may be considered in determining the lowest 
bid.) Invitations for bids shall clearly set forth all requirements 
which the bidder must fulfill in order for his bid to be evaluated by 
the grantee. Any or all bids may be rejected when it is in the grantee's 
interest to do so.
    (vi) Procurements may be negotiated if it is impractical and 
unfeasible to use formal advertising. Generally, procurements may be 
negotiated by the grantee if:
    (A) The public exigency will not permit the delay incident to 
advertising;
    (B) The material or service to be procured is available from only 
one person

[[Page 651]]

or firm; (all contemplated sole source procurements where the aggregate 
expenditure is expected to exceed $5,000 shall be referred to the Bureau 
for prior approval).
    (C) The total amount involved does not exceed $10,000;
    (D) The contract is for personal or professional services, or for 
any service to be rendered by a university, college, or other 
educational institutions;
    (E) No acceptable bids have been received after formal advertising;
    (F) The purchases are for highly perishable materials or medical 
supplies; for material or services where the prices are established by 
law; for technical items or equipment requiring standardization and 
interchangeability of parts with existing equipment; for experimental, 
developmental or research work; for supplies purchased for authorized 
resale; and for technical or specialized supplies requiring substantial 
initial investment for manufacture;
    (G) Otherwise authorized by law, rules or regulations. 
Notwithstanding the existence of circumstances justifying negotiation, 
competition shall be obtained to the maximum extent practicable.
    (vii) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who 
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms 
and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given 
to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, 
financial and technical resources, or accessibility to other necessary 
resources.
    (viii) Procurement records or files for purchases in amounts over 
$10,000 shall provide at least the following pertinent information: 
Justification for the use of negotiation in lieu of advertising, 
contractor selection, and the basis for the cost or price negotiation.
    (ix) A system for contract administration shall be maintained to 
assure contractor conformance with terms, conditions, and specifications 
of the contract or order, and to assure adequate and timely followup of 
all purchases.
    (c) In addition to provisions to define a sound and complete 
agreement, the grantee shall include the following provisions in all 
contracts and subgrants:
    (1) Contracts shall contain such contractual provisions or 
conditions which will allow for administrative, contractual, or legal 
remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract 
terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be 
appropriate.
    (2) All contracts, amounts for which are over $10,000 shall contain 
suitable provisions for termination by the grantee including the manner 
by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, 
such contracts shall describe conditions where the contract may be 
terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be 
terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the 
contractor.
    (3) In all contracts for construction or facility improvement 
awarded over $100,000, grantees shall observe the bonding requirements 
provided in Sec. 276.4.
    (4) All construction contracts awarded by recipients and their 
contractors or subgrantees having a value of more than $10,000, shall 
contain a provision requiring compliance with Executive Order 11246, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Labor 
Regulations (41 CFR part 87). However, this Equal Employment Opportunity 
provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements 
prescribed in Sec. 276.13 have been met.
    (5) All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair shall 
include a provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kick Back'' 
Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations 
(29 CFR part 3). This Act provides that each contractor or subgrantee 
shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in 
the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any 
part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The grantee 
shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Bureau.

[[Page 652]]

    (6) When required by the Federal grant program legislation, all 
construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees over $2,000 
shall include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 
U.S.C. 276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor 
regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under this Act, contractors shall be 
required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than 
the minimum wages specified in a wage determination made by the 
Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors shall be required to pay 
wages not less often than once a week. The grantee shall place a copy of 
the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of 
Labor in each solicitation and the award of a contract shall be 
conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The grantee 
shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Bureau.
    (7) Where applicable, all contracts awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees over $2,000 for construction contracts and over $2,500 for 
other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers 
shall include a provision for compliance with sections 103 and 107 of 
the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as 
supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under 
Section 103 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the 
wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work day 
of 8 hours and a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the 
standard workday or workweek is permissible if the worker is compensated 
at a rate of not less than 1\1/2\ times the basic rate of pay for all 
hours worked over 8 hours in any calendar day or 40 hours in the work 
week. Section 107 of the Act applies to construction work and provides 
that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or 
under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous 
to his health and safety as determined under construction, safety, and 
health standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. These 
requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or 
articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for 
transportation or transmission of intelligence.
    (8) Contracts or agreements, the principal purpose of which is to 
create, develop, or improve products, processes or methods; or for 
exploration into fields which directly concern public health, safety, or 
welfare; or constraints in the field of science or technology in which 
there has been little significant experience outside of work funded by 
Federal assistance, shall contain a notice to the effect that matters 
regarding rights to inventions, and materials generated under the 
contract or agreement are subject to the regulations issued by the 
Bureau. The contractor shall be advised as to the source of additional 
information regarding these matters.
    (9) All negotiated contracts (except those of $10,000 or less) 
awarded by grantees shall include a provision to the effect that the 
grantee, the Bureau, the Comptroller General of the United States, or 
any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any 
books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are 
directly pertinent to a specific grant program for the purpose of making 
audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.
    (10) Contracts and subgrants of amounts over $100,000 shall contain 
a provision which requires the recipient to agree to comply with all 
applicable standards, orders, or regulations issued pursuant to the 
Clean Air Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) as amended. Violations 
shall be reported to the Bureau and the Regional Office of the 
Environmental Protection Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 276.13  Indian preference in grant administration.

    Any grant or subgrant shall require that to the greatest extent 
feasible:
    (a) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment in 
connection with the administration of such a grant or subgrant shall be 
given to Indians.
    (b) Preference in the award of a subgrant, contract or subcontract 
in connection with administration of a grant shall be given to Indian 
organizations and economic enterprises.

[[Page 653]]

    (c) A tribal governing body may develop its own Indian preference 
requirements to the extent that such requirements are not inconsistent 
with the purpose and intent of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
for grants executed under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 276.14  Budget revision.

    Criteria and procedures to be followed by grantees in reporting 
deviations from grant budgets and requesting approval for budget 
revisions are as follows:
    (a) For nonconstruction grants, grantees shall request prior 
approvals promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the grant-supported program.
    (2) The revision indicates the need for additional Bureau funding.
    (3) The grant budget is over $100,000 and the cumulative amount of 
transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or is 
expected to exceed $10,000, or five percent of the grant budget, 
whichever is greater. The same criteria apply to cumulative amount of 
transfers among programs, functions, and activities when budgeted 
separately for a grant, except that the Bureau shall permit no transfer 
which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part thereof, to be used 
for purposes other than those intended.
    (4) The grant budget is $100,000, or less, and the cumulative amount 
of transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or 
is expected to exceed five percent of the grant budget. The same 
criteria apply to the cumulative amount of transfers among programs, 
functions, and activities when budgeted separately for a grant, except 
that the Bureau shall permit no transfer which would cause any Federal 
appropriation, or part thereof, to be used for purposes other than those 
intended.
    (5) The revisions involve the transfer of amounts budgeted for 
indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs.
    (6) The revisions pertain to the addition of items requiring 
approval in accordance with the provisions of appendix A of this part.
    (b) All other changes to nonconstruction grant budgets, except for 
the changes described in paragraph (d) of this section do not require 
approval. These changes include:
    (1) The use of grantee funds in furtherance of program objectives 
over and above the grantee minimum share included in the approved grant 
budget and
    (2) The transfer of amounts budgeted for direct costs to absorb 
authorized increases in indirect costs.
    (c) For construction grants, grantees shall request prior approval 
promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the grant-supported programs.
    (2) The revision increases the budgeted amounts of Bureau funds 
needed to complete the project.
    (d) When the Bureau awards a grant which provides support for both 
construction and nonconstruction work, the Bureau may require, in the 
grant agreement, the grantee to request prior approval before making any 
fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.
    (e) For both construction and nonconstruction grants, the Bureau 
shall require tribal grantees to notify the Bureau promptly whenever the 
amount of Bureau authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the 
grantee by more than $5,000 or 5 percent of the Bureau grant, whichever 
is greater. This notification will not be required when applications for 
additional funding are submitted for continuing grants.
    (f) When requesting approval for budget revisions, grantees shall 
use the budget forms which were used in the grant application. However, 
grantees may request by letter the approvals required by the provisions 
of appendix A of this part.
    (g) Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for 
budget revisions, the Bureau shall review the request and notify the 
grantee whether or not the budget revisions have been approved. If the 
Bureau does not reach a decision prior to the end of the 30-day period 
or should the grantee not be notified of the Bureau's decision by the 
end of the 30-day period the grantee

[[Page 654]]

may appeal directly to the Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 276.15  Grant closeout.

    (a) In closing out Bureau grants, the following shall be observed:
    (1) Upon request, the Bureau shall make prompt payments to a grantee 
for allowable reimbursable costs under the grant being closed out.
    (2) The grantee shall immediately refund to the Bureau any 
unencumbered balance of cash advanced to the grantee.
    (3) The Bureau shall obtain from the grantee within 90 days after 
the date of completion of the grant all financial, peformance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. The Bureau may grant 
extensions when requested by the grantee.
    (4) The Bureau shall make a settlement for any upward or downward 
adjustments to the Federal share of costs after these reports are 
received.
    (5) The grantee shall account for any property acquired with grant 
funds, or received from the Government in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 276.11.
    (6) If a final audit has not been performed before the closeout of 
the grant, the Bureau shall retain the right to recover an appropriate 
amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs 
resulting from the final audit.
    (b) Suspension. When a grantee has materially failed to comply with 
the terms and conditions of a grant, the Bureau may after reasonable 
notice to the grantee, suspend the grant. The notice preceding 
suspension shall include the effective date of the suspension, the 
reasons for the suspension, the corrective measures necessary for 
reinstatement of the grant, and, if there is no immediate threat to 
safety, a reasonable time frame for corrective action prior to actual 
suspension. No obligations incurred by the grantee during the period of 
suspension shall be allowable under the suspended grant, except that the 
Bureau may at its discretion allow necessary and proper costs which the 
grantee could not reasonably avoid during the period of suspensions if 
such costs would otherwise be allowable under the applicable cost 
principles specified in appendix A of this part. Appropriate adjustments 
to the payments under the suspended grant will be made, either by 
withholding the payments or by not allowing the grantee credit for 
disbursements which he may make in liquidation of unauthorized 
obligations he incurs during the period of suspension. Suspensions shall 
remain in effect until the grantee has taken corrective action to the 
satisfaction of the Bureau or given assurances satisfactory to the 
Bureau that corrective action will be taken, or until the Bureau cancels 
the grant.
    (c)(1) Cancellation for cause. The Bureau may cancel any grant in 
whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever 
it is determined that the grantee has:
    (i) Materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
grant;
    (ii) Violated the rights or endangered the health, safety, or 
welfare of any persons;
    (iii) Been grossly negligent in or has mismanaged the handling or 
use of funds provided under the grant.
    (2) When it appears that cancellation of a grant shall become 
necessary, the Bureau shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of 
this possibility. This written notice shall advise the grantee of the 
reason for the possible cancellation and the corrective action necessary 
to avoid cancellation. The Bureau shall also offer, and provide if 
requested by the grantee, any technical assistance which may be required 
to effect the corrective action. The grantee shall have 60 days in which 
to effect this corrective action before the Bureau provides notice of 
intent to cancel the grant as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Upon deciding to cancel for cause, the Bureau shall promptly 
notify the grantee in writing of that decision, the reasons for the 
cancellation, and the effective date. The Bureau shall also provide a 
hearing for the grantee before cancellation, as provided in Sec. 272.51. 
However, the Bureau may immediately cancel the grant, upon notice to the 
grantee, if the Bureau determines that continuance of the grant poses an 
immediate threat to safety. In this event, the Bureau shall provide a 
hearing for the grantee within ten (10) days of cancellation.

[[Page 655]]

    (4) Payments made to grantees or recoveries by the Bureau under 
grants cancelled for cause shall be in accordance with the legal rights 
and obligations of the parties.
    (d)(1) Cancellation on other grounds. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, grants may be cancelled in whole or in 
part only as follows:
    (i) By the Bureau with the consent of the grantee, in which case the 
two parties shall agree upon the cancellation conditions, including the 
effective date, and in the case of partial cancellation, the portion to 
be cancelled; or
    (ii) By the grantee, upon written notice to the Bureau, setting 
forth the reasons for the cancellation, the effective date, and, in the 
case of partial cancellation, the portion to be cancelled.
    (2) When a grant is cancelled in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section, the grantee shall not incur new obligations for the 
cancelled portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many 
outstanding obligations as possible. The Bureau shall allow full credit 
to the grantee for the Bureau share of the noncancellable obligations 
properly incurred by the grantee before cancellation.

Sec. 276.16  Subgrants and subcontracts to non-profit organizations.

    The uniform administrative requirements in this part, including the 
cost principles in appendix A, to this part, are applicable to all 
subgrants or subcontracts made by a grantee in accordance with the 
provisions of this chapter. However, these requirements and cost 
principles are applicable as minimum standards for subgrants or 
subcontracts made to nonprofit organizations. Accordingly, the grantee 
may prescribe additional or more stringent requirements with regard to 
subgrants or subcontracts made to non-profit organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 276.17  Printing.

    As permitted by paragraph 36-2(c) in the Government Printing and 
Binding Regulations (October 1974, No. 23), published by the Joint 
Committee on Printing (JCP), printing required by a grantee in 
performing work under a grant is considered ``incidental printing'' 
(e.g., material which the grantee needs to use to respond to the terms 
of the grant). Whenever the incidental printing is likely to exceed the 
exclusions in paragraphs 36-3 and 36-4 of the Joint Committee on 
Printing (JCP) Printing and Binding Regulations, specific provisions on 
printing as may be required shall be included in the grant agreement. 
Grantees shall be given the option of using sources other than the 
Government Printing Office for incidental printing.

 Appendix A to Part 276--Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to 
                                 Grants

                             part i--general

    A. Purpose and scope. 1. Objectives. This attachment sets forth 
principles for determining the allowable costs of programs administered 
by grantees under grants from the Bureau. The principles are for the 
purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the 
circumstances or dictate the extent of Bureau and tribal participation 
in the financing of a particular grant. They are designed to provide 
that Bureau assisted programs bear their fair share of costs recognized 
under these principles, except where restricted or prohibited by law. No 
provision for profit or other increment above cost is intended.
    2. Policy guides. The application of these principles is based on 
the fundamental premises that:
    a. Grantees are responsible for the efficient and effective 
administration of grant programs through the application of sound 
management practices.
    b. The grantee assumes the responsibility for seeing that Bureau 
assisted program funds have been expended and accounted for consistent 
with underlying agreements and program objectives.
    c. Each grantee organization, in recognition of its own unique 
combination of staff facilities and experience, will have the primary 
responsibility for employing whatever form of organization and 
management techniques may be necessary to assure proper and efficient 
administration.
    3. Application. These principles will be applied by the Bureau in 
determining costs incurred by grantees under Bureau grants (including 
subgrants, contracts by grantees and subcontracts).

[[Page 656]]

    B. Definitions. 1. Approval or authorization of the Bureau  means 
documentation evidencing consent prior to incurring specific cost.
    2. Cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, 
accumulating, and distrtibuting allowable costs under grants and 
contracts together with the allocation methods used.
    3. Cost, as used herein, means cost as determined on a cash, 
accrual, or other basis acceptable to the Bureau as a discharge of the 
grantee's accountability for Bureau funds.
    4. Cost objective means a pool, center, or area established for the 
accumulation of cost. Such areas include organizational units, 
functions, objects or items of expense as well as ultimate cost 
objectives including specific grants, projects, contracts, and other 
activities.
    5. Federal agency means any department, agency, commission, or 
instrumentality in the executive branch of the Federal Government which 
makes grants to grantees.
    6. Grant means an agreement between the Bureau and a grantee whereby 
the Bureau provides funds or aid in kind to carry out specified 
programs, services, or activities. The principles and policies stated in 
this Appendix as applicable to grants in general also apply to any 
Federally sponsored cost reimbursement type of agreement performed by a 
grantee, including contracts, subcontracts and subgrants.
    7. Grant program means those activities and operations of the 
grantee which are necessary to carry out the purposes of the grant, 
including any portion of the program financed by the grantee.
    8. Grantee means the entity which is responsible for administration 
of the grant.
    9. Services, as used herein, means goods and facilities, as well as 
services.
    10. Supporting services means auxiliary functions necessary to 
sustain the direct effort involved in administering a grant program or 
an activity providing service to the grant program. These services may 
be centralized in the grantee department or in some other agency, and 
include procurement, payroll, personnel functions, maintenance and 
operation of space, data processing, accounting, budgeting, auditing, 
mail and messenger service, and the like.
    C. Basic guidelines. 1. Factors affecting allowability of costs. To 
be allowable under a grant program, costs must meet the following 
general criteria:
    a. Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
administration of the grant program, be allocable thereto under these 
principles, and, except as specifically provided herein, not be a 
general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of a 
grantee.
    b. Be authorized or not prohibited under applicable laws or 
regulations.
    c. Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these 
principles, Federal laws, or other governing limitations as to types or 
amounts of cost items.
    d. Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that 
apply uniformly to both Federally assisted and other activities of which 
the grantee is a part.
    e. Be accorded consistent treatment through application of generally 
accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances.
    f. Not be allocable to or included as a cost of any other Federally 
financed program in either the current or a prior period.
    g. Be net of all applicable credits.
    2. Allocable costs. a. A cost is allocable to a particular cost 
objective to the extent of benefits received by such objective.
    b. Any cost allocable to a particular grant or cost objective under 
the principles provided for in this Appendix may not be shifted to other 
Federal grant programs to overcome funds deficiencies, avoid 
restrictions imposed by law or grant agreements, or for other reasons.
    c. Where an allocation of joint cost will ultimately result in 
charges to a grant program, an allocation plan will be required as 
prescribed in Section I.
    3. Applicable credits. a. Applicable credits refer to those receipts 
or reduction of expenditure-type transactions which offset or reduce 
expense items allocable to grants as direct or indirect costs. Examples 
of such transactions are: purchase discounts; rebates or allowances; 
recoveries or indemnities on losses; sale of publications, equipment, 
and scrap; income from personal or incidental services; and adjustments 
of overpayments or erroneous charges.
    b. Applicable credits may also arise when Bureau funds are received 
or are available from sources other than the grant program involved to 
finance operations or capital items of the grantee. This includes costs 
arising from the use of depreciation of items donated or financed by the 
Bureau to fulfill matching requirements under another grant program. 
These types of credits should likewise be used to reduce related 
expenditures in determining the rates or amounts applicable to a given 
grant.
    D. Composition of cost. 1. Total cost. The total cost of a grant 
program is comprised of allowable direct cost incident to its 
performance, plus its allocable portion of allowable indirect costs, 
less applicable credits.
    2. Classification of costs. There is no universal rule for 
classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect under every 
accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific 
service or function, but indirect with respect to the grant or other 
ultimate cost objective. It is essential, therefore, that each item of 
cost be treated consistently either as a direct or an indirect

[[Page 657]]

cost. Specific guides for determining direct and indirect costs 
allocable under grant programs are provided in the sections which 
follow.
    E. Direct costs. 1. General. Direct costs are those that can be 
identified specifically with a particular cost objective. These costs 
may be charged directly to grants, contracts, or to other programs 
against which costs are finally lodged. Direct costs may also be charged 
to cost objectives used for the other ultimate cost objective.
    2. Application. Typical direct costs chargeable to grant programs 
are:
    a. Compensation of employees for the time and effort devoted 
specifically to the execution of grant programs.
    b. Cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically 
for the purpose of the grant.
    c. Equipment and other approved capital expenditures.
    d. Other items of expense incurred specifically to carry out the 
grant agreement.
    e. Services furnished specifically for the grant program by other 
agencies, provided such charges are consistent with criteria outlined in 
Section G of these principles.
    F. Indirect costs. 1. General. Indirect costs are those (a) incurred 
for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective, 
and (b) not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically 
benefited, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. The 
term ``indirect costs,'' as used herein, applies to costs of this type 
originating in the grantee department, as well as those incurred by 
other departments in supplying goods, services, and facilities, to the 
grantee department. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect 
expenses to the cost objectives served, it may be necessary to establish 
a number of pools of indirect cost within a grantee department or in 
other agencies providing services to a grantee department. Indirect cost 
pools should be distributed to benefiting cost objectives on bases which 
will produce an equitable result in consideration or relative benefits 
derived.
    2. Grantee departmental indirect costs. All grantee departmental 
indirect costs, including the various levels of supervision, are 
eligible for allocation to grant programs provided they meet the 
conditions set forth in this Part. In lieu of determining the actual 
amount of grantee departmental indirect cost allocable to a grant 
program, the following methods may be used:
    a. Predetermined fixed rates for indirect costs. A predetermined 
fixed rate for computing indirect costs applicable to a grant may be 
negotiated annually in situations where the cost experience and other 
pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the 
contracting parties to reach an informed judgment (1) as to the probable 
level of indirect costs in the grantee department during the period to 
be covered by the negotiated rate, and (2) that the amount allowable 
under the predetermined rate would not exceed actual indirect cost.
    b. Negotiated lump sum for overhead. A negotiated fixed amount in 
lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate under circumstances where the 
benefits derived from a grantee department's indirect services cannot be 
readily determined as in the case of small, self-contained or isolated 
activity. When this method is used, a determination should be made that 
the amount negotiated will be approximately the same as the actual 
indirect cost that may be incurred. Such amounts negotiated in lieu of 
indirect costs will be treated as an offset to total indirect expenses 
of the grantee department before allocation to remaining activities. The 
base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be 
appropriately adjusted.
    3. Limitation on indirect costs. a. Bureau grants may be subject to 
laws that limit the amount of indirect costs that may be allowed. In 
this event, the Bureau will establish procedures which will assure that 
the amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such grant 
does not exceed the maximum allowable under the statutory limitation or 
the amount otherwise allowable under this Appendix, whichever is the 
smaller.
    b. When the amount allowable under a statutory limitation is less 
than the amount otherwise allocable as indirect costs under this 
Appendix the amount not recoverable as indirect costs under a grant may 
not be shifted to another Federally sponsored grant program or contract.
    G. Cost incurred by organizations other than the grantee. 1. 
General. The cost of service provided by other organizations may only 
include allowable direct costs of the service plus a prorata share of 
allowable supporting costs and supervision directly required in 
performing the service, but not supervision of a general nature such as 
that provided by the head of an organization and his staff assistants 
not directly involved in operations. However, supervision by the head of 
an organization whose sole function is providing the service furnished 
would be an eligible cost. Supporting costs include those furnished by 
other units of the supplying organizations.
    2. Alternative methods of determining indirect cost. In lieu of 
determining actual indirect cost related to a particular service 
furnished by another organization, either of the following alternative 
methods may be used provided only one method is used for a specific 
service during the fiscal year involved.
    a. Standard indirect rate. An amount equal to ten percent of direct 
labor cost in providing the service performed by another organization 
(excluding overtime, shift, or holiday

[[Page 658]]

premiums and fringe benefits) may be allowed in lieu of actual allowable 
indirect cost for that service.
    b. Predetermined fixed rate. A predetermined fixed rate for indirect 
cost of the unit or activity providing service may be negotiated as set 
forth in Section F.2.a.
    H. Cost incurred by grantee for others. 1. General. The principles 
provided in Section G will also be used in determining the cost of 
services provided by the grantee to another agency.
    I. Cost allocation plan. 1. General. A plan for allocation of costs 
will be required to support the distribution of any joint costs related 
to the grant program. All costs included in the plan will be supported 
by formal accounting records which will substantiate the propriety of 
eventual charges.
    2. Requirements. The allocation plan of the grantee should cover all 
joint costs of the grantees as well as costs to be allocated under plans 
of other agencies or organizational units which are to be included in 
the costs of federally sponsored programs. The cost allocation plans of 
all the agencies rendering services to the grantee, to the extent 
feasible, should be presented in a single document. The allocation plan 
should contain, but not neessarily be limited to, the following:
    a. The nature and extent of services provided and their relevance to 
the federally sponsored programs.
    b. The items of expense to be included.
    c. The methods to be used in distributing cost.
    3. Instructions for preparation of cost allocation plans. The 
Bureau, in consultation with the other Federal agencies concerned, will 
be responsible for developing and issuing the instructions for use by 
grantees in preparation of cost allocation plans.
    4. Submission of indirect cost proposal and negotiation of indirect 
cost rates.
    a. A grantee should submit its indirect cost proposal to the Federal 
agency which provides the largest dollar volume of contracts and grants. 
However, once a Federal agency has handled an indirect cost proposal, 
that same Federal agency should continue to act upon the proposal even 
though the preponderance of financial interest may have shifted to 
another Federal agency, and grantee shall not resubmit its indirect cost 
proposal to a second Federal agency.
    b. Where the grantee submits its proposal to the Department of 
Interior, the proposal should be sent by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to 
the cognizant Regional Office of the Department's Office of Audit and 
Investigation. The Office of Audit and Investigation is responsible for 
the audit and review of the proposals and negotiation of the indirect 
cost rates.
    c. Grant administrators officers will usually, but are not required 
to, accept indirect cost rates negotiated by other Federal agencies.
    d. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will provide technical assistance in 
developing indirect cost proposals, if needed.

              Part II--Standards for Selected Items of Cost

    A. Purpose and applicability. 1. Objective. This attachment provides 
standards for determining the allowability of selected items of cost.
    2. Application. These standards will apply irrespective of whether a 
particular item of cost is treated as direct or indirect cost. Failure 
to mention a particular item of cost in the standards is not intended to 
imply that it is either allowable or unallowable, rather determination 
of allowability in each case should be based on the treatment of 
standards provided for similar or related items of cost. The 
allowability of the selected items of cost is subject to the general 
policies and principles stated in Part I of this Appendix.
    B. Allowable costs. 1. Accounting. The cost of establishing and 
maintaining accounting and other information systems required for the 
management of grant programs is allowable. This includes cost incurred 
by central service agencies for these purposes. The cost of maintaining 
central accounting records required for overall tribal government 
purposes, such as appropriation and fund accounts by the Treasurer, 
Comptroller, or similar officials, is considered to be a general expense 
of government and is not allowable.
    2. Advertising. Advertising media includes newspapers, magazines, 
radio and television programs, direct mail, trade papers, and the like. 
The advertising costs allowable are those which are solely for:
    a. Recruitment of personnel required for the grant program.
    b. Solicitation of bids for the procurement of goods and services 
required.
    c. Disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the 
performance of the grant agreement.
    d. Other purposes specifically provided for in the grant agreement.
    3. Advisory councils. Costs incurred by grantee advisory councils or 
committees established pursuant to Bureau requirements to carry out 
grant programs are allowable. The cost of like organizations is 
allowable when provided for in the grant agreement.
    4. Audit service. The cost of audits necessary for the 
administration and management of functions related to grant programs is 
allowable.
    5. Bonding. Costs of premiums on bonds covering employees who handle 
grantee funds are allowable.

[[Page 659]]

    6. Budgeting. Costs incurred for the development, preparation, 
presentation, and execution of budgets are allowable. Costs for services 
of a central budget office are generally not allowable since these are 
costs of general government. However, where employees of the central 
budget office activity participate in the grantee budget process, the 
cost of identifiable services is allowable.
    7. Building lease management. The administrative cost for lease 
management which includes review of lease proposals, maintenance of a 
list of available property for lease, and related activities is 
allowable.
    8. Central stores. The cost of maintaining and operating a central 
store's organization for supplies, equipment, and materials used either 
directly or indirectly for grant programs is allowable.
    9. Communications. Communication costs incurred for telephone calls 
or service, telegraph, teletype service, wide area telephone service 
(WATS), centrex, telpak (tie lines), postage, messenger service and 
similar expenses are allowable.
    10. Compensation for personal services. a. General. Compensation for 
personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, 
for services rendered during the period of performance under the grant 
agreement, including but not necessarily limited to wages, salaries, and 
supplementary compensation and benefits. The costs of such compensation 
are allowable to the extent that total compensation for individual 
employees: (1) Is responsible for the services rendered, (2) follows an 
appointment made in accordance with tribal government ordinances and 
rules and which meets Federal merit system or other requirements, where 
applicable; and (3) is determined and supported as provided in b., 
below. Compensation for employees engaged in federally assisted 
actvities will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is 
consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the 
tribal government. In cases where the kinds of employees required for 
the federally assisted activities are not found in the other activities 
of the tribal government, compensation will be considered reasonable to 
the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the 
labor market in which the employing government competes for the kind of 
employees involved. Compensation surveys providing data representative 
of the labor market involved will be an acceptable basis for evaluating 
reasonableness.
    b. Payroll and distribution of time. Amounts charged to grant 
programs for personal services, regardless of whether treated as direct 
or indirect costs, will be based on payrolls documented and approved in 
accordance with generally accepted practice of the tribal government. 
Payrolls must be supported by time and attendance or equivalent records 
for individual employees. Salaries and wages of employees chargeable to 
more than one grant program or other cost objective will be supported by 
appropriate time distribution records. The method used should produce an 
equitable distribution of time and effort.
    11. Depreciation and use allowance. a. Grantees may be compensated 
for the use of their own buildings, capital improvements, and equipment 
through use allowances or depreciation. Use allowances are the means of 
providing compensation in lieu of depreciation or other equivalent 
costs. However, a combination of the two methods may not be used in 
connection with a single class of fixed assets.
    b. The computation of depreciation or use allowance will be based on 
acquisition cost. Where actual cost records have not been maintained, a 
reasonable estimate of the original acquisition cost may be used in the 
computation. The computation will exclude the cost or any portion of the 
cost of buildings and equipment donated or borne directly or indirectly 
by the Federal Government through charges to Federal grant programs or 
otherwise, irrespective of whether title was originally vested or where 
it presently resides. In addition, the computation will also exclude the 
cost of land. Depreciation or a use allowance on idle or excess 
facilities is not allowable, except when specifically authorized by the 
grantor Federal agency.
    c. Where the depreciation method is followed, adequate property 
records must be maintained, and any generally accepted method of 
computing depreciation must be consistently applied for any specific 
asset or class of assets for all affected Federally sponsored programs 
and must result in equitable charges considering the extent of the use 
of the assets for benefit of such programs.
    d. In lieu of depreciation, a use allowance for buildings and 
improvements may be computed at an annual rate not exceeding two percent 
of acquisition cost. The use allowance for equipment (excluding items 
properly capitalized as building cost) will be computed at an annual 
rate not exceeding six and two-thirds percent of acquisition cost of 
usable equipment.
    e. No depreciation or use charge may be allowed on any assets that 
would be considered as fully depreciated, provided, however, that 
reasonable use charges may be negotitated for any such assets if 
warranted after taking into consideration the cost of the facility or 
item involved, the estimated useful life remaining at time of 
negotiation, the effect of any increased maintenance charges or 
decreased efficiency due to age, and any other factors pertinent to 
utilization of the facility or item for the purpose contemplated.
    12. Disbursing service. The cost of disbursing grant program funds 
by the Treasurer or

[[Page 660]]

other designated officer is allowable. Disbursing services cover the 
processing of checks or warrants, from preparation to redemption, 
including the necessary records of accountability and reconciliation of 
such records with related cash accounts.
    13. Employee fringe benefits. Costs identified under a. and b. below 
are allowable to the extent that total compensation for employees is 
reasonable as defined in Section B.10.
    a. Employee benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to 
employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as 
for annual leave, sick leave, court leave, military leave, and the like, 
if they are: (1) Provided pursuant to an approved leave system, and (2) 
the cost thereof is equitably allocated to all related activities, 
including grant programs.
    b. Employee benefits in the form of employers' contribution or 
expenses for social security, employees' life and health insurance 
plans, unemployment insurance coverage, workmen's compensation 
insurance, pension plans, severance pay, and the like, provided such 
benefits are granted under approved plans and are distributed equitably 
to grant programs and in other activities.
    14. Employee morale, health and welfare costs. The costs of health 
or first-aid clinics and/or infirmaries, recreational facilities, 
employees' counseling services, employee information publications, and 
any related expenses incurred, are allowable. Income generated from any 
of these activities will be offset against expenses.
    15. Exhibits. Costs of exhibits relating specifically to the grant 
programs are allowable.
    16. Legal expenses. The cost of legal expenses required in the 
administration of grant programs is allowable. Legal services furnished 
by the chief legal officer of a tribal government or his staff solely 
for the purpose of discharging his general responsibilities as legal 
officer are unallowable. Legal expenses for the prosecution of claims 
against the Federal Government are unallowable.
    17. Maintenance and repair. Costs incurred for necessary 
maintenance, repair, or upkeep of property which neither add to the 
permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended 
life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable.
    18. Materials and supplies. The cost of materials and supplies 
necessary to carry out the grant programs is allowable. Purchases made 
specifically for the grant program should be charged thereto at their 
actual prices after deducting all cash discounts, trade discounts, 
rebates, and allowances received by the grantee. Withdrawals from 
general stores or stockrooms should be charged at cost under any 
recognized method of pricing consistently applied. Incoming 
transportation charges are a proper part of material cost.
    19. Memberships, subscriptions and professional activities. a. 
Memberships. The cost of membership in civic, business, technical and 
professional organizations is allowable provided: (1) The benefit from 
the membership is related to the grant program, (2) the expenditure is 
for agency membership, (3) the cost of the membership is reasonably 
related to the value of the services or benefits received, and (4) the 
expenditure is not for membership in an organization which devotes a 
substantial part of its activities to influencing legislation.
    b. Reference material. The cost of books, and subscriptions to 
civic, business, professional, and technical periodicals is allowable 
when related to the grant program.
    c. Meetings and conferences. Costs are allowable when the purpose of 
the meeting is the dissemination of technical information relating to 
the grant program and they are consistent with regular practices 
followed for other activities of the grantee.
    20. Motor pools. The costs of a service organization which provides 
automobiles to grantees at a mileage or fixed rate and/or provides 
vehicle maintenance, inspection and repair services are allowable.
    21. Payroll preparation. The cost of preparing payrolls and 
maintaining necessary related wage records is allowable.
    22. Personnel administration. Costs for the recruitment, 
examination, certification, classification, training, establishment of 
pay standards, and related activities for grant programs, are allowable.
    23. Printing and reproduction. Cost for printing and reproduction 
services necessary for grant administration, including but not limited 
to forms, reports, manuals, and informational literature, are allowable. 
Publication costs of reports or other media relating to grant program 
accomplishments or results are allowable when provided for in the grant 
agreement.
    24. Procurement service. The cost of procurement service, including 
solicitation of bids, preparation and award of contracts, and all phases 
of contract administration in providing goods, facilities and services 
for grant programs, is allowable.
    25. Taxes. In general, taxes or payments in lieu of taxes which the 
grantee is legally required to pay are allowable.
    26. Training and education. The cost of in-service training, 
customarily provided for employee development which directly or 
indirectly benefits grant programs is allowable. Out-of-service training 
involving extended periods of time is allowable only when specifically 
authorized by the Bureau.
    27. Transportation. Costs incurred for freight, cartage, express, 
postage and other transportation costs relating either to goods 
purchased, delivered, or moved from one location to another are 
allowable.

[[Page 661]]

    28. Travel. Travel costs are allowable for expenses for 
transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by 
employees who are in travel status on official business incident to a 
grant program. Such costs may be charged on an actual basis, on a per 
diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual costs incurred, or on a 
combination of the two, provided the method used is applied to an entire 
trip, and results in charges consistent with those normally allowed in 
like circumstances in non-Federally sponsored activities. The difference 
in cost between first-class air accommodations and less-than-first-class 
air accommodations is unallowable except when less-than-first-class air 
accommodations are not reasonably available.
    C. Costs allowable with approval of the Bureau. 1. Automatic data 
processing. The cost of data processing services to grant programs is 
allowable. This cost may include rental of equipment or depreciation on 
grantee-owned equipment. The acquisition of equipment, whether by 
outright purchase, rental-purchase agreement or other method of 
purchase, is allowable only upon specific prior approval of the Bureau 
as provided under the selected item for capital expenditures. The Bureau 
must obtain required Departmental clearances before such approval can be 
given.
    2. Building space and related facilities. The cost of space in 
privately or publicly owned buildings used for the benefit of the grant 
program is allowable subject to the conditions stated below. The total 
cost of space, whether in a privately or publicly owned building, may 
not exceed the rental cost of comparable space and facilities in a 
privately owned building in the same locality. The cost of space 
procured for grant program usage may not be charged to the program for 
periods of nonoccupancy, without authorization of the Bureau.
    a. Rental cost. The rental cost of space in a privately owned 
building is allowable.
    b. Maintenance and operation. The cost of utilities, insurance,

normal repairs and alterations and the like, are allowable to the extent 
they are not otherwise included in rental or other charges for space.
    c. Rearrangements and alterations. Cost incurred for rearrangement 
and alteration of facilities required specifically for the grant program 
or those that materially increase the value or useful life of the 
facilities (Section C.3.) are allowable when specifically approved by 
the Bureau.
    d. Depreciation and use allowances on publicly owned buildings. 
These costs are allowable as provided in Section B.11.
    e. Occupancy of space under rental-purchase or a lease with option-
to-purchase agreement. The cost of space procured under such

    3. Capital expenditures. The cost of facilities, equipment, other 
capital assets, and repairs which materially increase the value or 
useful life of capital assets is allowable when such procurement is 
specifically approved by the Bureau. When assets acquired with Bureau 
grant funds are (a) sold, (b) no longer available for use in a Federally 
sponsored program or (c) used for purposes not authorized by the Bureau, 
the Bureau's equity in the asset will be refunded in the same proportion 
as Bureau participation in its cost. In case any assets are traded on 
new items, only the net cost of the newly acquired assets is allowable.
    4. Insurance and indemnification. a. Costs of insurance required, or 
approved and maintained pursuant to the grant agreement, is allowable.

sound business practice.
    (2) Costs of insurance or of contributions to any reserve covering 
the risk of loss of, or damage to, Federal Government property is 
unallowable except to the extent that the Bureau has specifically 
required or approved such costs.
    c. Contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program approved 
by the Bureau are allowable to the extent that the type of coverage, 
extent of coverage, and the rates and premiums would have been allowed 
had insurance been purchased to cover the risks.
    d. Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible 
insurance (through an approved self-insurance program or otherwise) are 
unallowable unless expressly provided for in the grant agreement. 
However, costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal 
deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management 
practice, and minor losses not covered by insurance, such as spoilage, 
breakage and disappearance of small hand tools which occur in the 
ordinary course of operations, are available.
    e. Indemnification includes securing the grantee against liabilities 
to third persons and other losses not compensated by insurance or 
otherwise. The Bureau is obligated to indemnify the grantee only to the 
extent expressly provided for in the grant agreement, except as provided 
in d. above.
    5. Management studies. The cost of management studies to improve the 
effectiveness and efficiency of grant management for ongoing programs is 
allowable except that the cost of studies performed by agencies other 
than the grantee or outside consultants is allowable only when 
authorized by the Bureau.
    6. Preagreement costs. Costs incurred prior to the effective date of

        Appendix B to Part 276--Financial Reporting Requirements

    A. Purpose and scope. This appendix prescribes requirements for 
grantee to report financial information to the Bureau and to request 
advances and reimbursement when a letter-of-credit method is not used.
    B. Definitions. 1. Accrued expenditures. Accrued expenditures are 
the charges incurred by the grantee during a given period requiring the 
provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other tangible property received; 
(2) services performed by employes, contractors, subgrantees, and other 
payees; and (3) amounts becoming owed under programs for which no 
current services or performed are required.
    2. Accrued income. Accrued income is the earnings during a given 
period which is a source of funds resulting from: (1) Services performed 
by the grantee; (2) goods and other tangible property delivered to 
purchasers; and (3) amounts becoming owed to the grantee for which no 
current services or performance are required by the grantee.
    3. Disbursements. Disbursements are payments in cash or by check.
    4. Bureau funds authorized. Funds authorized represent the total 
amount of the Bureau funds authorized for obligations and establish the 
ceilings for obligation of Bureau funds. This amount may include any 
authorized carryover of unobligated funds from prior fiscal years.
    5. Obligations. Obligations are the amounts of orders placed, 
contracts and grants awarded, services received, and similar 
transactions during a given period, which will require payment during 
the same or a future period.
    6. Outlays. Outlays represent charges made to the grant project or 
program. Outlays can be reported on a cash or accrued expenditure basis.
    7. Program income. Program income represents earnings by the grantee 
realized from the grant-supported activities. Such earnings exclude 
interest income and may include, but will not be limited to, income from 
service fees, sale of commodities, usage or rental fees, sale of assets 
purchased with grant funds, and royalties on patents and copy-rights. 
Program income can be reported on a cash or accrued income basis.
    8. Unobligated balance. The unobligated balance is the portion of 
the funds authorized by the Bureau which has not been obligated by the 
grantee and is determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from 
the funds authorized.
    9. Unpaid obligations. Unpaid obligations represent the amout of 
obligations incurred by the grantee which have not been paid.
    C. Standard forms. 1. Only the following forms will be authorized 
for obtaining financial information from grantees for grant programs:
    a. Financial Status Report. (1) The Bureau shall require grantees to 
use a standard Financial Status Report to report the status of funds for 
all nonconstruction grant programs. The Bureau may, however, have the 
option of not requiring a Federal Status Report when a request for 
advance or reimbursement (paragraph 2a) is determined to provide 
adequate information to meet their needs, except that a final Financial 
Status Report shall be required at the completion of the grant when the 
Request for Advance or

[[Page 663]]

Reimbursement form is used only for advances.
    (2) The Bureau shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash 
or accrual basis. If the Bureau requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accouting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, 
the grantee should develop such information through an analysis of the 
documentation on hand or on the basis of best estimates.
    (3) The grant agreement shall determine the frequency of the 
Financial Status Report for each grant program considering the size and 
complexity of the particular program. However, the report shall not be 
required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than 
annually. Also, a final report shall be required at the completion of 
the grant.
    (4) The original and two copies of the Financial Status Report shall 
be submitted 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period. 
In addition, final reports shall be submitted 90 days after the end of 
the grant period or the completion of the project or program. Extensions 
to reporting due dates may be approved when requested by the grantee.
    b. Report of federal cash transactions. (1) When funds are advanced 
to grantees through letters of credit or with Treasury checks, each 
grantee shall submit a report of Federal Cash Transactions. The Bureau 
shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain 
disbursement or outlay information for each grant or project from the 
grantees.
    (2) The grant agreement may require forecasts of Federal cash 
requirement in the Remarks section of the report.
    (3) When practical and deemed necessary, the Bureau may require 
grantees to report in the Remarks section the amount of cash in excess 
of three days' requirements in the hands of subgrantees or other 
secondary recipients and to provide short narrative explanations of 
actions taken by the grantees to reduce the excess balances.
    (4) The Bureau shall accept the identical information from the 
grantees in a machine-usable format in lieu of the Report of Federal 
Cash Transactions.
    (5) Grantees shall submit the original and two copies of the Report 
of Federal Cash Transactions no later than 15 working days following the 
end of each quarter. For those grantees receiving annual grants 
totalling one million dollars or more, the Bureau shall require a 
monthly report.
    (6) The Bureau shall waive the requirement for submission of a 
Report of Federal Cash Transactions when monthly advances do not exceed 
$10,000 per grantee provided that such advances are monitored through 
other forms contained in this Appendix or the grantee's accounting 
controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances.
    2. Except as noted below, only the following forms will be 
authorized for the grantees in requesting advances and reimbursements.
    a. Request for advance or reimbursement. (1) The ``Request for 
Advance or Reimbursement'' form is the standard form for all 
nonconstruction grant programs when letters of credit or predetermined 
automatic advance methods are not used. The Bureau, however, has the 
option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of an 
``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction 
Programs'' (paragraph 2b) and shall specify in the grant agreement.
    (2) Grantees shall be authorized to submit requests for advances or 
reimbursement at least monthly when letters of credit are not used. 
Grantees shall submit the original and two copies of a Request for 
Advance or Reimbursement.
    b. Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction 
Program. (1) The ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs'' form is the standard format to be used for 
requesting reimbursement for construction programs. The Bureau may, 
however, have the option of substituting a ``Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement'' form (paragraph 2a) in lieu of this form when the Bureau 
determines that the former provides adequate information to meet its 
needs as stated in the grant agreement.
    (2) Grantees shall be authorized to submit requests for 
reimbursement at least monthly when letters of credit are not used. 
Grantees shall submit the original and two copies of an ``Outlay Report 
and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs'' form.
    3. When the Bureau needs additional information in using these 
forms, the following shall be observed:
    a. When necessary to comply with future legislative requirements, 
the Bureau shall issue instructions to require grantees to submit such 
information under the Remarks section of the reports.
    b. When necessary to meet specific program needs, the Bureau shall 
submit the proposed reporting requirements to the General Services 
Administration for approval under the exception provision of this 
Appendix.
    c. The Bureau, in obtaining information as in paragraphs a and b 
above, must also comply with report clearance requirements of the Office 
of Management and Budget Circular No. A-40, as revised.

Sec. 286.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part 286 is to prescribe the regulations and 
procedures under which non-reimbursable grants may be made to eligible 
applicants to stimulate and increase Indian entrepreneurship and 
employment through establishment, acquisition or expansion of profit-
making Indian-owned economic enterprises which will contribute to the 
economy of a reservation.


<R05>
Sec. 286.3  Eligible applicants.

    Applications for grants may be accepted only from individual 
Indians, Indian tribes, Indian partnerships, corporations or cooperative 
associations authorized to do business under State, Federal, or Tribal 
law. These applicants must have a form of organization acceptable to the 
Assistant Secretary and unable to meet their total financing needs from 
their own resources and by loans from other sources such as banks, 
Farmers Home Administration, Small Business Administration, Production 
Credit Associations, and Federal Land Banks. Associations, corporations 
or partnerships shall be at least fifty-one percent owned by eligible 
Indians or an eligible Indian tribe. This Indian ownership must actively 
participate in the management and operation of the economic enterprise 
by representation on the board of directors of a corporation or 
cooperative association proportionate to the Indian ownership which will 
enable the Indian owner(s) to control management decisions. The legal 
organization documents will provide for the number of Indians which are 
to be on the board of directors, how they along with other directors 
will be elected or appointed and qualifications required as a condition 
for becoming a member of the board of directors. The legal organization 
documents shall provide safeguards which will prevent Indian ownership 
and control from decreasing below fifty-one percent. Evidence of Indian 
ownership in a cooperative association or corporation will be evidenced 
by stock ownership, if stock is or has been issued, or by other evidence 
satisfactory to the Assistant Secretary. Partnerships will be evidenced 
by written partnership agreements which show the percentage of Indian 
ownership, role and authority in making management decisions in 
controlling the operation of the economic enterprise.


<R05>
Sec. 286.4  Eligible economic enterprises.

    An economic enterprise as defined in Sec. 286.1(k) is eligible to 
receive equity capital through non-reimbursable grants if it is or will 
be self-sustaining and profit-oriented and will create employment for 
Indians. In the case of Indian-owned cooperative associations, they must 
distribute or allocate profits for later distribution, to members who 
are patrons, unless prohibited from doing so by law.


<R05>
Sec. 286.5  Information collection.

    (a) The collections of information contained in Secs. 286.12 and 
286.22 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1076-0093. The 
information will be used to rate applicants in accordance with the 
priority criteria listed at 25 CFR 286.8. Response to this request is 
required to obtain a benefit in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1521.
    (b) Public reporting for this information is estimated to average 45 
minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send 
comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, Mailstop 337-SIB, 18th and C Streets, NW., Washington, 
DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction 
Project (1076-0093), Washington, DC 20503.

<R05>
Sec. 286.15  Application procedures.

    Applications are to be submitted to the Superintendent having 
administrative jurisdiction over the reservation on which an enterprise

<R05>
Sec. 286.16  Grant approval authority.

    Applications for grants require approval by the Assistant Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 286.17  Grant limitations and requirements.

    (a) Grants will be made to assist in establishing new economic 
enterprises, or in purchasing or expanding established ones. However, a 
grant may be made only when in the opinion of the Assistant Secretary 
the applicant is unable to obtain adequate financing from other sources. 
Prior to making any grant, the Assistant Secretary shall assure that, to 
the extent practical, the applicant's own resources have been invested 
in the proposed project. The applicant shall not be required to invest 
own resources to the extent that they are already committed to endeavors 
deemed by the Assistant Secretary to be essential to the welfare of the 
applicant. If the information in an application, which must include 
personal financial statements, indicates that it may be possible for the 
applicant to obtain financing without a grant, the Assistant Secretary 
will require the applicant to furnish letters from two customary lenders 
in the area, if available, who are making loans for similar purpose, 
showing whether or not they will make a loan to the applicant for the 
total financing needed without a grant.
    (b) A grant may be made only to an applicant who is able to obtain 
at least 75 percent of the necessary financing from other sources.
    (c) No grant in excess of $250,000 may be made to an Indian tribe or 
in excess of $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, 
or cooperative association.
    (d) Revolving loan funds as prescribed in title I of the Indian 
Financing Act of 1974 and guaranteed or insured loans as prescribed in 
title II of said Act may not be used as the sources of the loan portion 
of the total financing requirement if financing from other governmental 
or institutional lenders is available on reasonable terms and 
conditions. If a loan is not available from other sources, guaranteed or 
insured loans under the provisions of title II of said Act may then be 
considered. If a guaranteed or insured loan is not available loans under 
the provisions of title I of said Act may then be considered. Applicants 
for a loan from either source must meet the eligibility requirements for 
such loans.
    (e) A grant will not be approved unless there is assurance the 
applicant can and will be provided with needed competent technical and 
management

[[Page 668]]

assistance commensurate with the nature of the enterprise to be funded 
and the knowledge and management skills of the applicant.
    (f) Grant funds may not be used for refinancing or debt 
consolidation unless approval is justified and required due to the 
applicant's financial position and is clearly to the advantage of the 
grant applicant.
    (g) Ordinarily, not more than one grant will be made for a project. 
Nevertheless, in certain circumstances a second grant may be made to 
applicants for a new project or expansion of the original project. An 
additional grant will not be approved for an economic enterprise 
previously funded under the provisions of title IV of the Indian 
Financing Act of 1974 except for expanding a successful enterprise, 
provided the total of grants made shall not exceed $250,000 to an Indian 
tribe and $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or 
cooperative association.
    (h) An application for a second grant will not be approved if the 
applicant:
    (1) Has not complied with the reporting requirements in connection 
with the first grant, or
    (2) Has not followed the plan of operation, if any, developed for 
the management and operation of the economic enterprise, or
    (3) Did not follow and use the management and technical assistance 
furnished, or
    (4) Is in violation of one or more provisions of the loan agreement 
entered into between the applicant and the lender who furnished the loan 
portion of the financing in connection with the first grant.
    (i) An applicant for an expansion grant must meet the same 
eligibility requirements as an original applicant.
    (j) A grantee will be required to return all or a portion of the 
grant if the business or enterprise for which the grant was utilized is 
sold within three years of the date on which the grant was disbursed to 
the grantee, unless the proceeds from the sale are re-invested in a new 
business or business expansion which will benefit the Indian reservation 
economy. Such sale and re-investment must have the prior approval of the 
local agency superintendent. The grantee shall refund the lessor of the 
grant amount or a pro rata portion of sales proceeds. The pro rata 
portion of sales proceeds shall be based on the ratio of grant amount to 
its corresponding matching financing. The new business or business 
expansion utilizing such sale proceeds must meet the same criteria for 
eligibility as an original grant.

Sec. 286.20  Disbursement of grant funds.

    Unless otherwise provided by an agreement between a lender and the 
grantee, the Assistant Secretary may in his discretion advance grant 
funds directly to a grantee. He may require the funds to be deposited in 
a special account at the appropriate Agency headquarters office or 
deposited in a joint account in a bank and disbursed as needed by the 
grantee. The terms of a lender's loan agreement may require the lender's 
approval before disbursement of the funds. Grant funds will not be 
disbursed to a grantee until the Assistant Secretary has been informed 
by the lender that a loan has been approved for the grantee in the 
amount of the loan financing needed.


<R05>
Sec. 286.21  Return of unused funds.

    Grantees will be required to return unused grant funds to the 
Assistant Secretary if the economic enterprise for which the grant was 
approved is not initiated, i.e., lease obtained, if needed, construction 
started, equipment purchased or other, within the time stated in the 
grant agreement. The Assistant Secretary may, if warranted by 
circumstances beyond the control of the grantee, extend the time to 
allow for

[[Page 669]]

initiation of the enterprise, provided there is assurance the enterprise 
will be initiated forthwith within the extended time period. The 
Assistant Secretary will notify the lender in writing of a proposed 
action to require the return of grant funds or of a proposal to extend 
the time.


<R05>
Sec. 286.22  Reports.

    (a) Grantees are required to furnish the Assistant Secretary 
comparative balance sheets and profit and loss statements semi-annually 
for the first two years of operation following receipt of the grant, and 
annually thereafter for the succeeding three years. These may be copied 
of financial statements required by and furnished to the lender which 
provided the loan portion of the total financing required. If the lender 
does not require financial statements, the grantee must prepare and 
furnish copies of comparative balance sheets and profit and loss 
statements to the Assistant Secretary.
    (b) The Assistant Secretary will establish accounting and reporting 
systems which will appropriately show the status of the Indian Business 
Development Program at all times.

<R05>

 Appendix to Chapter I--Extension of the Trust or Restricted Status of 
                          Certain Indian Lands

    This appendix contains citations of Executive orders and acts of 
Congress continuing the trust or restricted period of Indian land, which 
would have expired otherwise, within the several Indian reservations in 
the States named. The asterisk to the left of the name of a reservation 
indicates that the reservation is subject to the benefits of the Indian 
Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 461-479), 
as amended, and as therein provided the trust or restricted period of 
the land is extended indefinitely. Where the name of a reservation is 
not preceded by an asterisk, such reservation is not subject to the 
Reorganization Act and is not subject to the benefits of such indefinite 
trust or restricted period extension, but such reservation is dependent 
upon acts of Congress or Executive orders for extension of the trust or 
restricted period of the land.
    For the purpose of insuring the continuation of the trust or 
restricted status of Indian allotments within Indian reservations not 
subject to the Reorganization Act, Congress by the act of June 15, 1935 
(49 Stat. 378) reimposed such restrictions as may have been expired 
between the dates of June 18, 1934, and December 31, 1936.

<R05>
Sec. 309.1  How do the regulations in this part carry out the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990?

    These regulations define the nature and Indian origin of products 
protected by the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (18 U.S.C. 1159, 25 
U.S.C. 305 et seq.) from false representations, and specify how the 
Indian Arts and Crafts Board will interpret certain conduct for

sale or sell any good in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian 
produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian, or 
Indian tribe, or Indian arts and crafts organization resident within the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 309.2  What are the key definitions for purposes of the Act?

    (a) Indian as applied to an individual means a person who is a 
member of an Indian tribe or for purposes of this part is certified by 
an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan (in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 309.4).
    (b) Indian artisan means an individual who is certified by an Indian 
tribe as a non-member Indian artisan.
    (c) Indian arts and crafts organization means any legally 
established arts and crafts marketing organization composed of members 
of Indian tribes.

[[Page 681]]

    (d) Indian product--(1) In general. Indian product means any art or 
craft product made by an Indian.
    (2) Illustrations. The term ``Indian product'' includes, but is not 
limited to:
    (i) Art works that are in a traditional or non-traditional Indian 
style or medium;
    (ii) Crafts that are in a traditional or non-traditional Indian 
style or medium;
    (iii) Handcrafts, i.e. objects created with the help of only such 
devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to condition the shape 
and design of each individual product.
    (3) Exclusion for products made before 1935. The provisions of this 
part shall not apply to any art or craft products made before 1935.
    (e) Indian tribe means--
    (1) Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any

<R05>
Sec. 309.3  How will statements about Indian origin of art or craft products be interpreted?

    (a) In general. The unqualified use of the term ``Indian'' or of the 
term ``Native American'' or the unqualified use of the name of an Indian 
tribe, in connection with an art or craft product, is interpreted to 
mean for purposes of this part that--
    (1) The maker is a member of an Indian tribe, is certified by an 
Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, or is a member of the 
particular Indian tribe named; and
    (2) The art or craft product is an Indian product.
    (b) Products of Indians of foreign tribes--(1) In general. The 
unqualified use of the term ``Indian'' or of the term ``Native 
American'' or the unqualified use of the name of a foreign tribe, in 
connection with an art or craft product, regardless of where it is 
produced and regardless of any country-of-origin marking on the product, 
is interpreted to mean for purposes of this part that--
    (i) The maker is a member of an Indian tribe, is certified by an 
Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, or is a member of the 
particular Indian tribe named;
    (ii) The tribe is resident in the United States; and
    (iii) The art or craft product is an Indian product.
    (2) Exception where country of origin is disclosed. Paragraph (b) of 
this section does not apply to any art or craft for which the name of 
the foreign country of tribal ancestry is clearly disclosed in 
conjunction with marketing of the product.
    (c) Example. X is a lineal descendant of a member of Indian Tribe A. 
However, X is not a member of Indian Tribe A, nor is X certified by 
Indian Tribe A as a non-member Indian artisan. X may not be described in 
connection with the marketing of an art or craft product made by X as an 
Indian, a Native American, a member of an Indian tribe, a member of 
Tribe A, or as a non-member Indian artisan of an Indian tribe. However, 
the true statement may be used that X is of Indian descent, Native 
American descent, or Tribe A descent.

<R05>

of such Indian tribe; and
    (2) The certification must be documented in writing by the governing 
body of an Indian tribe or by a certifying body delegated this function

1990, Public Law 101-644, a tribe may not impose a fee for certifying an 
Indian artisan.


<R05>
Sec. 309.5  What penalties apply?

    A person who offers or displays for sale or sells a good, with or

Sec. 514.1  Annual fees.

    (a) Each class II gaming operation under the jurisdiction of the 
Commission shall pay to the Commission annual fees as established by the 
Commission. The Commission, by a vote of not less than two of its 
members, shall adopt the rates of fees to be paid.
    (1) The Commission shall adopt preliminary rates for each calendar 
year during the first quarter of that year (or as soon thereafter as 
possible), and, if considered necessary, shall modify those rates during 
the second and third quarters of the calendar year.
    (2) The Commission shall adopt final rates of fees for each calendar 
year during the fourth quarter of that year.
    (3) The Commission shall publish the rates of fees in a notice in 
the Federal Register.
    (4) The rates of fees imposed shall be--
    (i) No less than 0.5 percent nor more than 2.5 percent of the first 
$1,500,000 (1st tier), and
    (ii) No more than 5 percent of amounts in excess of the first 
$1,500,000 (2nd tier) of the assessable gross revenues from each class 
II gaming operation regulated by the Commission.
    (5) If a tribe has a certificate of self-regulation, the rate of 
fees imposed shall be no more than .25 percent of assessable gross 
revenues from self-regulated class II gaming operations.
    (b) For purposes of computing fees, assessable gross revenues for 
each gaming operation are the annual total amount of money wagered in 
class II gaming, admission fees (including table or card fees), less any 
amounts paid out as prizes or paid for prizes awarded, and less an 
allowance for amortization of capital expenditures for structures.
    (1) Unless otherwise provided by the regulations, generally accepted 
accounting principles shall be used.
    (2) The allowance for amortization of capital expenditures for 
structures shall not exceed 5% of the cost of structures in use 
throughout the year and 2\1/2\% of the cost of structures in use during 
only a part of the year.

    (4) All revenues from gaming operations determined by the licensing 
tribe to be class II are to be included.
    (c) Each Class II gaming operation regulated by the Commission shall 
file with the Commission quarterly a statement showing its assessable 
gross revenues for the previous calendar year.

[[Page 692]]

    (1) These quarterly statements shall show the amounts derived from 
each class II type of game, the amounts deducted for prizes, and the 
amounts deducted for the amortization of structures;
    (2) These quarterly statements shall be filed no later than--March 
31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each calendar year the 
Class II gaming operation is subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Commission, beginning in September 1991. Any changes or adjustments to 
the previous year's assessable gross revenue amounts from one quarter to 
the next shall be explained.
    (3) The quarterly statements shall identify an individual or 
individuals to be contacted should the Commission need to communicate 
further with the gaming operation. The telephone numbers of the 
individual(s) shall be included.
    (4) The quarterly statements shall be transmitted to the Commission 
to arrive no later than the due date.
    (5) Each Class II gaming operation shall determine the amount of 
fees to be paid and remit them with the statement required in paragraph 
(c) of this section. The fees payable shall be computed using--
    (i) The most recent rates of fees adopted by the Commission pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section,
    (ii) The assessable gross revenues for the previous calendar year as 
reported pursuant to this paragraph, and
    (iii) The amounts paid and credits received during previous 
quarters.
    (6) Each quarterly statement shall include the computation of the 
fees payable, showing all amounts used in the calculations. The required 
calculations are as follows:
    (i) Multiply the previous calendar year's 1st tier assessable gross 
revenues by the rate for those revenues adopted by the Commission.
    (ii) Multiply the previous calendar year's 2nd tier assessable gross 
revenues by the rate for those revenues adopted by the Commission.
    (iii) Add (total) the results (products) obtained in paragraphs 
(c)(6) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (iv) Multiply the total obtained in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this 
section by the fraction representing the quarter for which the 
computation is being made: 1st quarter--\1/4\; 2nd quarter--\1/2\ (\2/
4\); 3rd quarter--\3/4\; and 4th quarter--1 (\4/4\). For the purpose of 
making these computations in 1991 only, the third calendar quarter is 
the first quarter and the fourth calendar quarter is the second quarter. 
There will be no third or fourth quarter in 1991.
    (v) Subtract the amounts already remitted by the operation for the 
current year and credits, if any, which are due for any previous year's 
overpayment from the amount determined in paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this 
section.
    (vi) The amount computed in paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section is 
the amount to be remitted.
    (7) Examples of fee computations follow:

    (i) Example 1: Where a filing is made for the first quarter of the 
calendar year, the previous year's assessable gross revenues are 
$2,000,000, the fee rates adopted by the Commission are 2% on the first 
$1,500,000 and 4% on the remainder, and a credit of $2,000 is due from 
the previous year, the amounts to be used and the computations to be 
made are as follows:

1st tier revenues--$1,500,000 x 2%=...........................   $30,000

    (ii) Example 2: Where a filing is being made for the third quarter, 
the previous year's assessable gross revenues are $5,000,000, the fee 
rates adopted by the Commission are 1% on the first $1,500,000 and 1.5% 
on the remainder, and $35,000 has already been remitted, the amounts to 
be used and the computations to be made are as follows:

1st tier revenues--$1,500,000 x 1%=...........................   $15,000
2nd tier revenues--3,500,000 x 1.5%=..........................    52,500

\1\ This amount may be other than $33,750 ($67,500 x .50) because the   
  assessable gross revenues may have been adjusted, the fee rate may    
  have changed, a credit for the previous year's overpayment may have   
  been received, or a clerical error may have been discovered.          

    (iii) Example 3: Where a filing is being made for the third quarter 
of 1991, the previous year's assessable gross revenues are $5,000,000, 
the fee rates adopted by the Commission are 1% on the first $1,500,000 
and 1% on the remainder, and nothing has already been remitted, the 
amounts to be used and the computations to be made are as follows:

    (8) Quarterly statements, remittances and communications about fees 
shall be transmitted to the Commission at the following address: Office 
of Finance, National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M Street, NW., suite 
250, Washington, DC 20036-5803. Checks should be made payable to the 
National Indian Gaming Commission (do not remit cash).
    (9) The Commission may assess a penalty for failure to file timely a 
quarterly statement.
    (10) Interest shall be assessed at rates established from time to 
time by the Secretary of the Treasury on amounts remaining unpaid after 
their due date (31 U.S.C. 3717).
    (d) The total amount of all fees imposed during any fiscal year 
shall not exceed $1,500,000. The Commission shall credit pro-rata any 
fees collected in excess of this amount against amounts otherwise due at 
the end of the quarter following the quarter during which the Commission 
makes such determination.
    (1) The Commission will notify each gaming operation as to the 
amount of overpayment, if any, and therefore the amount of credit to be 
taken against the next quarterly payment otherwise due.
    (2) The notification required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall be made in writing addressed to the gaming operation.
    (e) Failure to pay fees, any applicable penalties, and interest 
related thereto may be grounds for:
    (1) Closure, or
    (2) Disapproving or revoking the approval of the Chairman of any 
license, ordinance, or resolution required under this Act for the 
operation of gaming.
    (f) To the extent that revenue derived from fees imposed under the 
schedule established under this paragraph are not expended or committed 
at the close of any fiscal year, such funds shall remain available until 
expended (Pub. L. 101-121; 103 Stat. 718; 25 U.S.C. 2717a) to defray the 
costs of operations of the Commission.
    (g) The information collection requirements contained in paragraph 
(c) of this section have been approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 3200-
0011. The information is being collected to determine the assessable 
gross revenues of each gaming operation and the aggregate assessable 
gross revenues of all gaming operations. The information will be used to 
set and adjust fee rates and to verify the computations of fees paid by 
each class II gaming operation. Response is mandatory.

Sec. 515.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to inform the public of records 
maintained by the Commission about identifiable individuals and to 
inform those individuals how they may gain access to and amend records 
concerning themselves.
    (b) This part carries out the requirements of the Privacy Act of 
1974 (Pub. L. 93-579) codified at 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (c) The regulation applies only to records disclosed or requested 
under the Privacy Act of 1974, and not to requests for information made 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of Information Act.


<R05>
Sec. 515.2  Definitions.

    As defined in the Privacy Act of 1974 and for the purposes of this 
part, unless otherwise required by the context, the following terms 
shall have these meanings:
    (a) Individual means a citizen of the United States or an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
    (b) Maintain means maintain, collect, use, or disseminate.
    (c) Record means any item, collection, or grouping of information 
about an individual that is maintained by the Commission, including 
education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or 
employment history, and that contains the individual's name, or the 
identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the 
individual, such as social security number, finger or voice print, or a 
photograph.
    (d) System of records means a group of any records under the control 
of the Commission from which information is retrieved by the name of the 
individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier 
assigned to the individual.
    (e) Routine use means, with respect to the disclosure of a record, 
the use of such record for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose 
for which it was collected.


<R05>
Sec. 515.3  Identification of individuals making requests.

    (a) Any individual may request that the Commission inform him or her 
whether a particular record system named by the individual contains a 
record pertaining to him or her and the contents of such record. Such 
requests shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 515.4 of this part. 
The request may be made in person or in writing at the NIGC, suite 250,

(including witnesses' addresses). If the individual appears before a 
notary, the individual shall submit adequate proof of identity in the

identification acceptable to the notary. If the statement is witnessed, 
it shall include a statement above the witnesses' signatures that they 
personally know the individual or that the individual has submitted 
proof of his or her identity to their satisfaction. In any case in 
which, because of the extreme sensitivity of the record sought to be 
seen or copied, the Commission determines that the identification is not 
adequate, it may request the individual to submit additional proof of 
identity.
    (2) If the request is made in person, the requester shall submit 
proof of identity similar to that described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, and that is acceptable to the Commission. The individual may

part.
    (b) The parent of any minor individual or the legal guardian of any 
individual who has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to

of making that copy. Otherwise, the Commission may charge a fee 
sufficient to cover the cost of duplication.


<R05>
Sec. 515.10  Penalties.

    Any person who makes a false statement in connection with any 
request for a record, or an amendment thereto,

[[Page 697]]

under this part, is subject to the penalties prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 494 
and 495.
Sec. 515.11  General exemptions. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 515.12  Specific exemptions.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1) and (f):

                Indian Gaming Individuals Records System

    (b) The exemptions under paragraph (a) of this section apply only to 
the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption under 
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). When compliance would not appear to interfere with 
or adversely affect the overall responsibilities of the Commission with 
respect to licensing of key employees and primary management officials 
for employment in an Indian gaming operation, the applicable exemption 
may be waived by the Commission.
    (c) Exemptions from the particular sections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), because making available the 
accounting of disclosures to an individual who is the subject of a 
record could reveal investigative interest. This would permit the 
individual to take measures to destroy evidence, intimidate potential 
witnesses, or flee the area to avoid the investigation.
    (2) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(1), and (f) concerning individual 
access to records, when such access could compromise classified 
information related to national security, interfere with a pending 
investigation or internal inquiry, constitute an unwarranted invasion of 
privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or pose a potential 
threat to the Commission or its employees or to law enforcement 
personnel. Additionally, access could reveal the identity of a source 
who provided information under an express promise of confidentiality.
    (3) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), because to require the Commission to 
amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant, or untimely, 
because of the nature of the information collected and the length of 
time it is maintained, would create an impossible administrative and 
investigative burden by continually forcing the Commission to resolve 
questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.
    (4) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) because:
    (i) It is not always possible to determine relevance or necessity of 
specific information in the early stages of an investigation.
    (ii) Relevance and necessity are matters of judgment and timing in 
that what appears relevant and necessary when collected may be deemed 
unnecessary later. Only after information is assessed can its relevance 
and necessity be established.
    (iii) In any investigation the Commission may receive information 
concerning violations of law under the jurisdiction of another agency. 
In the interest of effective law enforcement and under 25 U.S.C. 
2716(b), the information could be relevant to an investigation by the 
Commission.
    (iv) In the interviewing of individuals or obtaining evidence in 
other ways during an investigation, the Commission could obtain 
information that may or may not appear relevant at any given time; 
however, the information could be relevant to another investigation by 
the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 517.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part contains the regulations of the National Indian Gaming 
Commission implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These 
regulations provide procedures by which

[[Page 698]]

members of the public may obtain access to records compiled, created, 
and maintained by the Commission, along with procedures the Commission 
must follow in response to such requests for records.


<R05>
Sec. 517.2  Definitions.

    (a) Commercial-use requester means requesters seeking information 
for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit 
interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is 
made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this 
category, the Commission shall determine the use to which a requester 
will put the documents requested. Where the Commission has reasonable 
cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, 
or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Commission 
shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a 
specific category.
    (b) Confidential commercial information means records provided to 
the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from 
disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, because disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (c) Direct costs means those expenditures by the Commission actually 
incurred in searching for and duplicating records to respond to a FOIA 
request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee or employees 
performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus a 
percentage of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating 
duplicating machinery. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, 
such as the cost of and heating or lighting of the facility in which the 
records are stored.
    (d) Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document 
necessary to fulfill a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of, 
among other things, paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or 
machine-readable documentation. The copies provided shall be in a form 
that is reasonably usable by requesters.
    (e) Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or 
private elementary school, an institution of undergraduate higher 
education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution 
of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, 
which operates a program of scholarly research.
    (f) Freedom of Information Act Officer means the person designated 
by the Chairman to administer the FOIA.
    (g) Non-commercial scientific institution refers to an institution 
that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is used in 
Sec. 517.2(a), commercial-use requester, and which is operated solely 
for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which 
are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (h) Representative of the news media refers to any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public.
    (i) Requester means any person, including an individual, Indian 
tribe, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private 
organization other than a Federal agency, that requests access to 
records in the possession of the Commission.
    (j) Review refers to the process of examining a record, in response 
to a FOIA request, to determine whether any portion of that record may 
be withheld under one or more of the FOIA Exemptions. It also includes 
processing of any record for disclosure, for example, redacting 
information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Review does 
not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues 
regarding the use of FOIA Exemptions.
    (k) Search refers to the time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within a document. The Commission shall 
ensure that searches are conducted in the most efficient and least 
expensive manner reasonably possible.
    (l) Submitter means any person or entity who provides information 
directly or indirectly to the Commission. The term includes, but is not 
limited to,

[[Page 699]]

corporations, Indian tribal governments, state governments and foreign 
governments.
    (m) Working day means a federal workday that does not include 
Saturdays, Sundays or federal holidays.


<R05>
Sec. 517.3  Requests for records.

    (a) Form of requests. Requests for records made pursuant to the FOIA 
may be in writing, specifically invoke the Act, and be addressed to the 
FOIA Officer, Suite 250, 1850 M St., NW., Washington, DC 20036-5803. 
Requests may also be made in person at the same address, where records 
will be available for inspection on the premises. Requests for records 
shall describe the records requested with enough specificity to enable 
Commission employees to locate the information requested with a 
reasonable amount of effort. Requests shall also include a statement of 
the maximum amount of fees the requester is willing to pay to obtain the 
requested information, or if a waiver or reduction of fees seems 
appropriate, the reasons for such waiver or reduction.
    (b) Types of records not available. The FOIA does not require the 
Commission to:
    (1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a 
request for records;
    (2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may 
be expected to come into existence at some future time; or
    (3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that 
the FOIA Officer must notify the requester that the requested records 
have been destroyed or disposed of.


<R05>
Sec. 517.4  Disclosure of requested records.

    (a) The FOIA Officer shall make requested records available to the 
public to the greatest extent possible in keeping with the FOIA, except 
that the following records are exempt from the disclosure requirements:
    (1) Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and which are, in fact, properly classified pursuant to 
such Executive order;
    (2) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and 
practices of the Commission;
    (3) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other 
than 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b)) provided that such statute requires that the 
matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no 
discretion on the issue or that the statute establishes particular 
criteria for withholding information or refers to particular types of 
matters to be withheld;
    (4) Records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the Commission;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and in the case of a recorded or information 
compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a 
criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national 
security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a 
confidential source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement

[[Page 700]]

investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be 
expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (8) Records contained in or related to examination, operating, or 
condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an 
agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial 
institutions;
    (9) Geological or geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (b) If a requested record contains exempted material along with 
nonexempted material, all reasonable segregable nonexempt material shall 
be disclosed.
    (c) The FOIA Officer may disclose requested information falling 
within the exemptions of paragraphs (a)(1)-(a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), 
(a)(8) and (a)(9) of this section, if to do so would further the 
purposes and policies of the FOIA and the IGRA. The FOIA Officer shall 
not disclose requested information falling within the exemptions of 
paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(7) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 517.5  Confidential commercial information.

    (a) Notice to submitters. The Commission shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, provide a submitter who provides confidential 
commercial information to the Commission, with prompt notice of a FOIA 
request or administrative appeal encompassing the confidential 
commercial information if the Commission may be required to disclose the 
information under the FOIA. Such notice shall either describe the exact 
nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records or 
portions thereof containing the confidential commercial information. The 
Commission shall also notify the requester that notice and an 
opportunity to object has been given to the submitter.
    (b) When notice is required. Notice shall be given to a submitter 
when:
    (1) The information has been designated by the submitter as 
confidential commercial information protected from disclosure. 
Submitters of confidential commercial information shall use good faith 
efforts to designate, either at the time of submission or a reasonable 
time thereafter, those portions of their submissions they deem protected 
from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA because disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm. Such 
designation shall be deemed to have expired ten years after the date of 
submission, unless the requester provides reasonable justification for a 
designation period of greater duration; or
    (2) The FOIA Officer has reason to believe that the information may 
be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.
    (c) Opportunity to object to disclosure. The Commission shall afford 
a submitter a reasonable period of time to provide the Commission with a 
detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement 
shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under 
any exemption of the FOIA, and if Exemption 4 applies, shall demonstrate 
the reasons the submitter believes the information to be confidential 
commercial information that is exempt from disclosure. Whenever 
possible, the submitters claim of confidentiality shall be supported by 
a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative 
of the submitter. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this 
paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
    (d) Notice of intent to disclose. The FOIA Officer shall carefully 
consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure 
prior to determining whether to disclose the information requested. 
Whenever the FOIA Officer determines that disclosure is appropriate, the 
FOIA Officer shall, within a reasonable number of days prior to 
disclosure, provide the submitter with written notice of the intent to 
disclose which shall include a statement of the reasons for which the 
submitter's objections were overruled, a description of the information 
to be disclosed, and a specified disclosure date. The FOIA Officer shall 
also notify the requester that the requested records will be made 
available.

[[Page 701]]

    (e) Notice of lawsuit. When a requester brings suit seeking to 
compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the FOIA 
Officer shall promptly notify the submitter of this action.
    (f) Exceptions to the notice requirements under this section. The 
notice requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall 
not apply if:
    (1) The FOIA Officer determines that the information should not be 
disclosed;
    (2) The information lawfully has been published or officially made 
available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than the 
FOIA);
    (4) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as 
exempt from disclosure in accordance with this part, when the submitter 
had the opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the 
information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the agency 
has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information 
would result in competitive harm; or
    (5) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with this 
part appears obviously frivolous. When the FOIA Officer determines that 
a submitter was frivolous in designating information as confidential, 
the FOIA Officer must provide the submitter with written notice of any 
final administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number 
of days prior to the specified disclosure date, but no opportunity to 
object to disclosure will be offered.


<R05>
Sec. 517.6  Response to requests for records.

    (a) Initial determinations. (1) The FOIA Officer shall make an 
initial determination regarding access to the requested information and 
shall so notify the requester within ten (10) working days after receipt 
of the request. This 10-day period may be extended ten (10) additional 
working days if unusual circumstances arise. If an extension is 
necessary, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the 
extension, briefly stating the reasons for the extension, and estimating 
when the FOIA Officer will respond. Unusual circumstances warranting 
extension are:
    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of records which are demanded in a single request; or
    (iii) The need for consultation with another agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request, which 
consultation shall be conducted with all practicable speed.
    (2) If the FOIA Officer decides that an initial determination cannot 
be reached within the time limits specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, he or she shall notify the requester of the reasons for the 
delay and include an estimate of when a determination will be made.
    (3) If no initial determination has been made at the end of the 10-
day period provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including any 
extension, the requester may appeal the action to the FOIA Appeals 
Officer.
    (4) If the FOIA Officer determines that another agency is 
responsible for responding to a request or part thereof, the FOIA 
Officer shall refer such request to the appropriate agency. The FOIA 
Officer shall inform the requester of the referral and of the name and 
address of the agency or agencies to which the request has been 
referred.
    (b) Granting of requests. When the FOIA Officer determines that the 
requested records shall be made available, he or she shall:

Sec. 517.7  Appeals.

    (a) Right of appeal. A requester may appeal to the FOIA Appeals 
Officer any adverse determination.
    (b) Notice of appeal.
    (1) Time for appeal. An appeal must be received no later than thirty 
(30) working days after notification of denial of access or after the 
time limit for response by the FOIA Officer has expired.
    (2) Form of appeal. An appeal shall be initiated by filing a written 
notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the 
original request and the initial denial. To expedite the appellate 
process and give the requester an opportunity to present his or her 
arguments, the notice should contain a brief statement of the reasons 
why the requester believes the initial denial to have been in error. The 
appeal shall be addressed to the Freedom of Information Act Appeals 
Officer, National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St., NW., suite 250, 
Washington, DC 20036.
    (c) Final agency determinations. The FOIA Appeals Officer shall

within twenty (20) working days after receipt of a notice of appeal. If 
the determination is to provide access to the requested records, the 
FOIA Officer shall make those records immediately available to the 
requester. If the determination upholds the denial of access to the 
requested records, the FOIA Appeals Officer shall notify the requester 
of the determination and the right of the requester to obtain judicial 
review in the appropriate federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 517.8  Fees.

    (a) In general. Fees pursuant to the FOIA shall be assessed 
according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for 
services rendered by the Commission in response to requests for records 
under this part. All fees shall be charged to the requester, except 
where the charging of fees is limited under paragraph (d) of this 
section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under 
paragraph (c) of this section. Requesters shall pay fees by check or 
money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
    (b) Charges for responding to FOIA requests. The following fees 
shall be assessed in responding to requests for records submitted under 
this part, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) Copies. The Commission shall charge $0.10 per page for copies of 
documents up to 8\1/2\'' x 14''. For copies prepared by computer, the 
Commission will charge actual costs of production of the computer 
printouts, including operator time. For other methods of reproduction, 
the Commission shall charge the actual costs of producing the documents.
    (2) Searches. (i) Manual searches. Whenever feasible, the Commission 
will charge at the salary rate (basic pay plus a percent for benefits) 
of the employee or employees performing the search. However, where a 
homogenous class of personnel is used exclusively in a search (e.g. all 
administrative/clerical or all professional/executive), the Commission 
shall charge $12.50 per hour for clerical time and $30.00 per hour for 
professional time. Charges for search time less than a full hour will be 
in increments of quarter hours.
    (ii) Computer searches. The Commission will charge the actual direct 
costs of conducting computer searches. These direct costs shall include 
the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of 
operating time that is directly attributable to searching for requested 
records, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary 
apportionable to the search. The Commission is not required to alter or 
develop programming to conduct searches.
    (3) Review fees. Review fees shall be assessed only with respect to 
those requesters who seek records for a commercial use under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section. Review fees shall be assessed at the same rates 
as those listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Review fees 
shall be assessed only for the initial record review, for example, 
review undertaken when the Commission analyzes the applicability of a 
particular exemption to a particular record or portion thereof at the 
initial

[[Page 703]]

request level. No charge shall be assessed at the administrative appeal 
level of an exemption already applied.
    (c) Statutory waiver. Documents shall be furnished without charge or 
at a charge below that listed in paragraphs (b) of this section where it 
is determined, based upon information provided by a requester or 
otherwise made known to the FOIA Officer, that disclosure of the 
requested information is in the public interest. Disclosure is in the 
public interest if it is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of government operations and is not primarily for 
commercial purposes. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be 
considered on a case by case basis. In order to determine whether the 
fee waiver requirement is met, the FOIA Officer shall consider the 
following six factors:
    (1) The subject of the request. Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns the operations or activities of the government;
    (2) The informative value of the information to be disclosed. 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of 
government operations or activities;
    (3) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure. Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to public understanding;
    (4) The significance of the contribution to public understanding. 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of government operations or activities;
    (5) The existence and magnitude of commercial interest. Whether the 
requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (6) The primary interest in disclosure. Whether the magnitude of the 
identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, 
in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (d) Types of requesters. There are four categories of FOIA 
requesters: commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial 
scientific institutional requesters, representatives of the news media, 
and all other requesters. These terms are defined in Sec. 517.2. 
Specific levels of fees are prescribed below for each of these 
categories.
    (1) Commercial-use requesters. The FOIA Officer shall charge 
commercial use requesters the full direct costs of searching for, 
reviewing, and duplicating requested records.
    (2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requesters. The FOIA Officer shall charge educational and non-commercial 
scientific institution requesters for document duplication only, except 
that the first 100 pages of copies shall be provided without charge.
    (3) News media requesters. The FOIA Officer shall charge news media 
requesters for document duplication costs only, except that the first 
100 pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge.
    (4) All other requesters. The FOIA Officer shall charge requesters 
who do not fall into any of the above categories fees which recover the 
full reasonable direct costs incurred for searching for and reproducing 
records if that total cost exceeds $15.00, except that the first 100 
pages and the first two hours of manual search time shall not be 
charged. To apply this term to computer searches, the FOIA Officer will 
determine the total hourly cost of operating the central processing unit 
and the operator's salary (plus 16 percent for benefits). When the cost 
of the search equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the 
salary of the person performing the search, the FOIA Officer will begin 
assessing charges for the computer search.
    (e) Charges for unsuccessful searches. Ordinarily, no charge will be 
assessed when requested records are not found or when the records 
located are withheld as exempt. However, if the requester has been 
notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been advised 
specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be withheld 
as exempt, fees may be charged.
    (f) Charges for interest. The FOIA Officer may assess interest 
charges on an unpaid bill, accrued under previous FOIA request(s), 
starting on the 31st

[[Page 704]]

day following the day on which the bill was sent to the requester. A fee 
received by the FOIA Officer, even if not processed, will result in a 
stay of the accrual of interest. The Commission shall follow the 
provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the implementing 
procedures to recover any indebtedness owed to the Commission.
    (g) Aggregating requests. A requester or a group of requesters may 
not submit multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of 
a document or documents solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When 
the Commission reasonably believes that a requester is attempting to 
divide a request into a series of requests to evade an assessment of 
fees, the Commission may aggregate such request and charge accordingly.
    (h) Advance payment of fees. Fees may be paid upon provision of the 
requested records, except that payment may be required prior to that 
time if the requester has previously failed to pay fees or if the FOIA 
Officer determines the total fee will exceed $250. When payment is 
required in advance of the processing of a request, the time limits 
prescribed in Sec. 517.6 shall not be deemed to begin until the FOIA 
Officer has received payment of the assessed fee.
    (i) Payment of fees. Where it is anticipated that the cost of 
providing the requested record will exceed $25.00 after the free 
duplication and search time has been calculated, and the requester has 
not indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee greater than $25.00, 
the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the amount of 
the anticipated fee or a portion thereof, which can readily be 
estimated. The notification shall offer the requesting party an 
opportunity to confer with agency representatives for the purpose of 
reformulating the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a 
reduced cost.

<R05>
Sec. 575.1  Scope.

    This part addresses the assessment of civil fines under section 
2713(a) of the Act with respect to notices of violation issued under 
Sec. 573.3 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 575.3  How assessments are made.

    The Chairman shall review each notice of violation and order of 
temporary closure in accordance with Sec. 575.4 of this part to 
determine whether a civil fine will be assessed, the amount of the fine, 
and, in the case of continuing violations, whether each daily illegal 
act or omission will be deemed a separate violation for purposes of the 
total civil fine assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 575.4  When civil fine will be assessed.

    The Chairman may assess a civil fine, not to exceed $25,000 per 
violation, against a tribe, management contractor, or individual 
operating Indian gaming for each notice of violation issued under 
Sec. 573.3 of this chapter after considering the following factors:
    (a) Economic benefit of noncompliance. The Chairman shall consider 
the extent to which the respondent obtained an economic benefit from the 
noncompliance that gave rise to a notice of violation, as well as the 
likelihood of escaping detection.
    (1) The Chairman may consider the documented benefits derived from 
the noncompliance, or may rely on reasonable assumptions regarding such 
benefits.
    (2) If noncompliance continues for more than one day, the Chairman 
may treat each daily illegal act or omission as a separate violation.
    (b) Seriousness of the violation. The Chairman may adjust the amount 
of a civil fine to reflect the seriousness of the violation. In doing 
so, the Chairman shall consider the extent to which the violation 
threatens the integrity of Indian gaming.
    (c) History of violations. The Chairman may adjust a civil fine by 
an amount that reflects the respondent's history of violations over the 
preceding five (5) years.
    (1) A violation cited by the Chairman shall not be considered unless 
the associated notice of violation is the subject of a final order of 
the Commission and has not been vacated; and
    (2) Each violation shall be considered whether or not it led to a 
civil fine.
    (d) Negligence or willfulness. The Chairman may adjust the amount of 
a civil fine based on the degree of fault of the respondent in causing 
or failing to correct the violation, either through act or omission.
    (e) Good faith. The Chairman may reduce the amount of a civil fine 
based on the degree of good faith of the respondent in attempting to 
achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.

[[Page 729]]


<R05>
Sec. 575.5  Procedures for assessment of civil fines.

    (a) Within 15 days after service of a notice of violation, or such 
longer period as the Chairman may grant for good cause, the respondent 
may submit written information about the violation to the Chairman. The 
Chairman shall consider any information so submitted in determining the 
facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the civil fine.
    (b) The Chairman shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment on 
the respondent within thirty (30) days after the notice of violation was 
issued, when practicable.
    (c) The Chairman may review and reassess any civil fine if necessary 
to consider facts that were not reasonably available on the date of 
issuance of the proposed assessment.


<R05>
Sec. 575.6  Settlement, reduction, or waiver of civil fine.

    (a) Reduction or waiver. (1) Upon written request of a respondent 
received at any time prior to the filing of a notice of appeal under 
part 577 of this chapter, the Chairman may reduce or waive a civil fine 
if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors 
present in a particular case, the fine is demonstrably unjust.
    (2) All petitions for reduction or waiver shall contain:
    (i) A detailed description of the violation that is the subject of 
the fine;
    (ii) A detailed recitation of the facts that support a finding that 
the fine is demonstrably unjust, accompanied by underlying 
documentation, if any; and
    (iii) A declaration, signed and dated by the respondent and his or 
her counsel or representative, if any, as follows: Under penalty of 
perjury, I declare that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the 
representations made in this petition are true and correct.
    (3) The Chairman shall serve the respondent with written notice of 
his or her determination under paragraph (a) of this section, including 
a statement of the grounds for the Chairman's decision.
    (b) Settlement. At any time prior to the filing of a notice of 
appeal under part 577 of this chapter, the Chairman and the respondent 
may agree to settle an enforcement action, including the amount of the 
associated civil fine. In the event a settlement is reached, a 
settlement agreement shall be prepared and executed by the Chairman and 
the respondent. If a settlement agreement is executed, the respondent 
shall be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of the 
violation or civil fine in question, except as otherwise provided 
expressly in the settlement agreement. In the absence of a settlement of 
the issues under this paragraph, the respondent may contest the assessed 
civil fine before the Commission in accordance with part 577 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 575.9  Final assessment.

    (a) If the respondent fails to request a hearing as provided in part 
577 of this chapter, the proposed civil fine assessment shall become a 
final order of the Commission.
    (b) Civil fines assessed under this part shall be paid by the person 
assessed and shall not be treated as an operating expense of the 
operation.
    (c) The Commission shall transfer civil fines paid under this 
subchapter to the U.S. Treasury.

information contained in that document is exempt from the mandatory 
public disclosure requirements under the Freedom of Information Act (5

confidential information), or is otherwise exempt by law from public 
disclosure, the person shall:
    (1) Indicate that the document in its entirety is exempt from 
disclosure or identify and segregate information within the document 
that is exempt from disclosure; and
    (2) Request that the presiding official not disclose such 
information to the parties to the proceeding (other than the Chairman, 
whose actions regarding

[[Page 732]]

the disclosure of confidential information are governed by Sec. 571.3 of 
this chapter) except pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and 
shall serve the request upon the parties to the proceeding. The request

presiding official may assume that there is no objection to disclosure 
of the document in its entirety.

is not warranted with respect to all or any part of the information in 
question, the presiding official shall so inform all parties by 
telephone, if possible, and by facsimile or express mail letter directed 
to the parties' last known addresses. The person requesting confidential 
treatment then shall be given an opportunity to withdraw the document 
before it is considered by the presiding official, or to disclose the 
information voluntarily to all parties.
    (e) If the presiding official determines that confidential treatment 
is warranted, the presiding official shall so inform all parties by 
facsimile or express mail directed to the parties' last known address.
    (f) When a decision by a presiding official is based in whole or in

so state, specifying the nature of the evidence and the provision of law 
under which disclosure was denied, and the evidence so considered shall 
be retained under seal as part of the official record.


<R05>

containing findings and an order disposing of the whole or any part of 
the proceeding.

Sec. 577.12  Intervention.

    (a) Persons other than the respondent may be permitted to 
participate as parties if the presiding official finds that:
    (1) The final decision could directly and adversely affect them or 
the class they represent;
    (2) They may contribute materially to the disposition of the 
proceedings;
    (3) Their interest is not adequately represented by existing 
parties; and
    (4) Intervention would not unfairly prejudice existing parties or 
delay resolution of the proceeding.
    (b) If a tribe has jurisdiction over lands on which there is a 
gaming operation that is the subject of a proceeding under this part, 
and the tribe is not already a named party, such tribe may intervene as 
a matter of right.
    (c) A person not named as a party and who wishes to participate as a 
party under this section shall submit a petition to the presiding 
official within ten (10) days after the person knew or should have known 
about the proceeding. The petition shall be filed with the presiding 
official and served on each person who has been made a part at the time 
of filing. The petition shall state concisely:
    (1) Petitioner's interest in the proceeding;
    (2) How his or her participation as a party will contribute 
materially to the disposition of the proceeding;
    (3) Who will appear for petitioner;
    (4) The issues on which petitioner wishes to participate; and
    (5) Whether petitioner wishes to present witnesses.
    (d) Objections to the petition may be filed by any party within ten 
(10) days after service of the petition.
    (e) When petitions to participate as parties are made by individuals 
or groups with common interests, the presiding official may request all 
such petitioners to designate a single representative, or he or she may 
recognize one or more petitioners.
    (f) The presiding official shall give each petitioner, as well as 
the parties, written notice of the presiding official's decision on the 
petition. For each petition granted, the presiding official shall 
provide a brief statement of the basis of the decision. If the petition 
is denied, the presiding official shall briefly state the grounds for 
denial and may then treat the petition as a request for participation as 
amicus curiae (that is, ``friend of the court'').


<R05>
Sec. 577.13  Transcript of hearing.

    Hearings under this part that involve oral presentations shall be 
recorded verbatim and transcripts thereof shall be provided to parties 
upon request. Fees for transcripts shall be at the actual cost of

conclusions of law upon each material issue of fact or law presented on 
the record.
    (b) Filing of objections. Within ten (10) days after the date of 
service of the presiding official's recommended decision, the parties

    The Commission shall affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, the 
recommended decision of the presiding official by a majority vote within 
thirty (30) days after the date on which the presiding official issued 
the decision. The Commission shall provide a notice and order to all 
parties stating the reasons for its action. In the absence of a majority 
vote by the Commission within the time provided by this section, the 
recommended decision of the presiding official shall be deemed affirmed 
except that, if the subject of the appeal is an order of temporary 
closure issued under Sec. 573.6 of this chapter, the order of temporary 
closure shall be dissolved.

96-305, 94 Stat. 929), hereinafter referred to as the Act, in accordance 
with the following objectives--
    (a) To insure that persons displaced as a result of the Act are 
treated fairly, consistently, and equitably so that these persons will 
not suffer the disproportionate adverse, social, economic, cultural and 
other impacts of relocation.
    (b) To set forth the regulations and procedures by which the 
Commission shall operate; and implement the provisions of the Act.

[[Page 739]]

    (c) To establish standards consistent with those established in the 
implementation of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property 
Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1894, 42 U.S.C. 4601 et. 
seq., Pub. L. 91-646), hereinafter referred to as the Uniform Act.
    (d) To insure that owners of habitations and other improvements to 
be acquired pursuant to the Act are treated fairly and consistently, to 
encourage and expedite acquisition by agreements with such owners, to 
minimize litigation, relieve congestion in the courts and to promote 
public confidence in the Commission's relocation program.
    (e) To facilitate development of a relocation plan according to the 
Act and carry out the directed relocation as promptly and fairly as 
possible, with a minimum of hardship and discomfort to the relocation, 
in accordance with the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 700.3  Assurances with respect to acquisition and displacement.

    The Commission will not approve any programs or projects which may 
result in the acquisition of habitations and/or improvements, or in the 
displacement of any person, until such time as written assurances are 
submitted to the Commission that such projects or programs are in 
accordance with the Act. It will--
    (a) Assure that, within a reasonable period of time prior to 
displacement, adequate, decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwellings

heads of households.

may be contacted for answers to questions or other needed help.


<R05>
Sec. 700.13  Waiver of regulations.

    (a) Any time limit specified for the filing of a claim or an appeal 
under the regulations in this part may, on a case by case basis, be 
extended by the Commission.
    (b) The Commission may waive any requirement of these regulations in 
this part if such requirement is not required by law and if the 
Commission finds such waiver or exception to be in the best interest of 
individual Indian applicants, the Commission, and the United States. Any 
request for a Commission waiver shall be submitted in writing to the 
Commission and shall be justified on a case by case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 700.15  Waiver of rights by owner.

    Nothing in these regulations shall prevent a fully informed 
applicant from voluntarily waiving any of his/her rights under the 
regulations in this part. A waiver of rights shall in no way constitute 
an exemption from the requirement to relocate pursuant to the Act.

acquisition of habitations and/or improvements that occur on or after 
the effective date of these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 700.113  Basic acquisition policies.

    (a) Appraisal and invitation to owner. Before the initiation of 
negotiations, the Commission shall have the habitations and/or 
improvements appraised to its satisfaction and will attempt to assure 
that the owner or his designated representative is contacted in advance 
of the appraisal(s) and given an opportunity to accompany each appraiser 
during the appraiser's inspection of the property.
    (b) Determination and offer of fair market value. Before the 
initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall establish an amount 
which it believes is fair market value for improvements. This amount 
shall be based on a current appraisal at the time negotations commence 
for the Relocation Contract between the NHIRC and the relocatee. The 
appraisal will be adjusted according to the Boeckh Building Cost 
Modifier for time or any physical changes in the improvements. If any 
changes are necessary the appraisal will be corrected to reflect a 
current dollar value. The amount of the current appraisal will be 
offered as just compensation for the improvements acquired, except as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section. A copy of the initial 
appraisal will be sent to the owner as soon as possible after the 
appraisal program is completed.
    (c) Basic negotiation procedures. The Commission will attempt to 
meet with the owner or his/her representative to discuss its offer to 
purchase his/her property including the basis for the determination of 
fair market value and explain acquisition policies and procedures, 
including payment of incidental

[[Page 744]]

expenses. The owner shall be given reasonable opportunity to present 
material which he/she believes is relevant to determining the value of 
the property and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and 
conditions of the purchase. The Commission shall consider the owner's 
presentation.
    (d) If the condition of the property indicates the need for a new 
appraisal or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the 
latest appraisal of the property, the Commission shall have the 
appraisal updated or obtain a new appraisal. If a new appraisal is for a 
lesser value than the previous appraisal and said lesser value is due to 
damage done to the property during the time between the two appraisals, 
and such damage was not caused by the owner of the improvement, the 
owner shall be entitled to the higher appraisal value.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Objection to determination of fair market value. If the owner 
objects to the Commission's determination of fair market value, the 
owner may request a hearing pursuant to the Commission's Hearing and 
Administrative Review procedures;
    (g) Payment before taking possession. Before requiring an owner to 
surrender possession of his habitations and/or improvements, the 
Commission shall--
    (1) Apply the agreed purchase price towards the acquisition price of 
the replacement dwelling or;
    (2) Deposit with the court in an appropriate proceeding, such as 
divorce or probate, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less 
than the Commission's determination of fair market value for the 
property or the court award of compensation for the property up to the 
maximum benefit allowed under the then existing replacement housing 
benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 700.115  Preliminary acquisition notice.

    As soon as feasible in the acquisition process, the Commission shall 
issue a preliminary acquisition notice to the owner. The notice shall--
    (a) Inform the owner of the Commission's interest in acquiring his/
her habitations and/or improvements.
    (b) Explain that such preliminary acquisition notice is not a notice 
to vacate and that it does not establish eligibility for relocation 
payments or other relocation assistance under these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 700.117  Criteria for appraisals.

    (a) Appraisal standards. The Commission's appraisals shall be based 
upon nationally recognized appraisal standards and techniques to the 
extent that such principles are consistent with the concepts of value 
that the Commission may establish.
    (b) Documentation. Appraisal reports must contain sufficient 
documentation, including supporting valuation data and the appraiser's 
analyses of that data, to demonstrate the reasonableness of the 
appraiser's opinion(s) of value.
    (c) Conflict of interest. No appraiser shall have any interest, 
direct or indirect, in the habitations and/or improvements which he 
appraisers for the Commission that would in any way conflict with his 
performance of the appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 700.119  Establishment of fair market value.

    (a) General. The Commission shall establish the amount of fair 
market value to be offered to the owner for the habitations and/or 
improvements. Such amount shall not be less than--
    (1) The appraiser's recommendations as to the fair market value of 
the habitations and/or improvements; or
    (2) The fair market value estimate set forth in the agency's 
approved appraisal, if the property is valued at $2,000 or less.
    (b) Owner retention of improvements. If the owner of a habitation 
and/or improvement is permitted to retain it for removal off-site, the 
amount determined to be just compensation for the interest in 
habitations and/or improvements to be acquired from him shall not be 
less than the amount determined by subtracting the salvage value of the 
improvements he retains for off-site removal from the amount determined 
to be fair market value for his entire interest in the habitation and 
improvement. Retention of improvements by the owner shall not change, 
alter or abrogate the requirement of

[[Page 745]]

the Act that the owner must move from land partitioned to the tribe of 
which he/she is not a member.


<R05>
Sec. 700.121  Statement of the basis for the determination of fair market value.

    At the time of the initiation of negotiations to acquire the 
habitations and/or improvements, the Commission shall furnish the owner, 
along with the initial written purchase offer, a written statement of 
the basis for the determination of fair market value. To the extent 
permitted by the Commission, the statement shall include the following--
    (a) A description and location identification of the habitations 
and/or improvements to be acquired.
    (b) An inventory identifying the buildings, structures, fixtures, 
and other improvements, including appurtenant removable building 
equipment, which are considered to be part of the habitations and/or 
improvements for which the offer of fair market value is made.
    (c) A recital of the amount of the offer and a declaration that such 
amount--
    (1) Is the full amount believed by the Commission to be just 
compensation for the property and is not less than the fair market value 
of the property as determined on the basis of the appraisal(s);
    (2) Does not reflect any relocation payments or other relocation 
assistance which the owner is entitled to receive.
    (d) If only a portion of a habitation and/or improvement is to be 
acquired, an apportionment of the total estimated just compensation for 
the partial acquisition will be made. In the event that the Commission 
determines that partial acquisitions are necessary, all portions so 
acquired will be acquired simultaneously.


<R05>
Sec. 700.123  Expenses incidental to transfer of ownership to the Commission.

    Eligible costs. The Commission shall reimburse the owner for 
reasonable expenses he/she necessarily incurred incidental to the 
transfer of habitations and/or improvements to the Commission. The 
Commission is not required to pay costs solely required to perfect the 
owner's interest in the habitations and/or improvements.


<R05>
Sec. 700.125  Disposal of property.

    Property acquired by the Commission pursuant to the Act shall be 
disposed of in one of the following manners:
    (a) If the Commission determines that the property acquired 
constitutes a substantial risk to public health and safety, the 
Commission may remove or destroy the property.
    (b) The Commission may transfer the property acquired by gratuitous 
conveyance to the tribe exercising jurisdiction over the area. Notice of 
such transfer shall be in writing and shall be completed within sixty 
(60) days from the finalization of all property acquisition procedures, 
unless the tribe notifies the Commission in writing within that time 
that the property transfer is refused. In the event of a refusal by the 
tribe, the Commission shall remove the property.


<R05>
Sec. 700.127  Payments for acquisition of improvements.

    Payments for acquisition of improvements shall be made in the 
following situations:
    (a) To individuals who have been denied benefits under these rules 
and who can prove ownership of habitations and improvements on land 
partitioned to the tribe of which they are not members. If the owner is 
deceased the payment shall be made to his or her estate. Payments under 
this subsection are further limited by 25 U.S.C. 640d-14(c), Pub. L. 93-
531, sec. 15(c).
    (b) To individuals who have been certified as eligible for

filed with the Commission within sixty (60) days after the family 
occupies the replacement home unless this time period is extended by the 
Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 700.143  Payments for divorced or separated relocatees.

    General. The following considerations apply to certified eligible 
heads of household who are legally separated or divorced and intend to 
establish separate eligibility.
    (a) Determination of benefits. Eligibility for relocation benefits 
is determined as of the time that the Relocation Contract is signed.
    (1) If the divorce or separation took place before benefits were 
first applied for, the spouse who vacated the habitation will not be 
eligibile for benefits and all relocation benefits will accrue to the 
spouse remaining in occupancy as head of the household remaining to be 
relocated.
    (2) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at 
the time that benefits are first applied for, and are divorced or 
separated prior to signing of a Relocation Contract, both husband and 
wife may qualify separately for benefits if each meets the requirements 
of eligibility under these regulations.
    (3) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at 
the time a Relocation Contract is signed but are divorced or separated 
prior to occupancy of the replacement dwelling, only one benefit will be 
paid to the household. Such benefits (including the assistance payment, 
moving expenses and replacement dwelling benefit) and the purchase price 
of the habitation and improvements may be prorated between husband and 
wife in such manner as they may agree in writing so long as such 
proration is consistent with the terms of the Relocation Contract. Such 
proration may also be made by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the 
absence of an agreement between the parties or a court order, any 
necessary prorations shall be made by the Commission.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a head of household shall be 
considered as married even though living apart from his or her spouse 
unless legally separated under a decree or separate maintenance.

<R05>
Sec. 700.145  Payments to estates.

    (a) Relocation benefits can be paid to the estate of a deceased 
Certified Eligible Head of Household under the following circumstances:
    (1) If there is no household requiring relocation pursuant to the 
Act surviving the deceased head of household:
    (i) Compensation for the habitation and other improvements owned by 
the deceased head of household and the cost of removing personal 
property from the acquired habitation and other improvements shall be 
paid to the estate of a deceased head of household, or as otherwise 
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (ii) No replacement housing benefit or assistance payment (bonus) 
shall be paid under this circumstance.
    (2) Replacement housing benefits may be paid to an estate only when 
a certified eligible head of household was qualified for such a housing 
payment pursuant to the Act and signed a Relocation Contract but died 
before the replacement housing was occupied. The estate of a certified 
eligible head of household who had not signed a Relocation Contract at 
the time of his/her death is not eligible for payment of a replacement 
housing benefit.
    (b) If one of a married couple who was a certified eligible head of 
household dies, the surviving spouse may be paid the same relocation 
assistance benefits, including replacement housing payments, which the 
couple would have received had death not occurred. If there is no 
surviving spouse, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a 
guardian to act for minor members of the household. The Commission shall 
deal with such guardian and any members of the household who have 
attained their majority in a manner to

[[Page 749]]

effect relocation of the remaining household under these regulations.

[47 FR 17988, Apr. 27, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 700.147  Eligibility.

    (a) To be eligible for services provided for under the Act, and 
these regulations, the head of household and/or immediate family must 
have been residents on December 22, 1974, of an area partitioned to the 
Tribe of which they were not members.
    (b) The burden of proving residence and head of household status is 
on the applicant.
    (c) Eligibility for benefits is further restricted by 25 U.S.C. 
640d-13(c) and 14(c).
    (d) Individuals are not entitled to receive separate benefits if it 
is determined that they are members of a household which has received 
benefits.
    (e) Relocation benefits are restricted to those who qualify as 
heads-of-household as of July 7, 1986.

as a result of moving or discontinuing his business, farm operation, or 
nonprofit organization. The payment shall consist of the reasonable 
costs incurred in attempting to sell the item plus the less of--
    (1) The fair market value of the item for continued use at the 
acquired site, less the proceeds from its sale. (When payment for 
property loss is claimed for goods held for sale, the fair market value 
shall be based on the cost of the goods to the business, not the 
potential selling price); or
    (2) The estimated cost of moving the item, but with no allowance for 
storage. (If the business, farm operation or nonprofit organization is 
discontinued, the estimated cost shall be based on a moving distance of

the replacement site, minus any proceeds from the sale or trade-in of 
the replaced item, if any; or
    (2) The estimated cost of moving the replaced item, based on the 
lowest acceptable bid or estimate obtained by the Commission for

<R05>

Sec. 700.167  Moving and related expenses--fixed payment.

business who is eligible for a payment for his actual moving and related 
expenses under subpart D of these regulations) is entitled to receive a 
fixed payment in lieu of a payment for such actual moving and related 
expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 700.169  Fixed payment for moving expenses--residential moves.

    The fixed payment for moving and related expenses of a certified 
eligible head of household from a dwelling consists of--
    (a) A moving expense allowance not to exceed $300 (three hundred

    (b) A dislocation allowance of $200 (two hundred dollars).


<R05>
Sec. 700.171  Fixed payment for moving expenses--nonresidential moves.

    (a) General. The fixed payment for moving and related expenses of a 
displaced business or farm operation that meets applicable requirements 
under this section is an amount equal to its average annual net earnings 
as computed in accordance with Sec. 700.173, but not less than $2,500 
nor more than $10,000. A nonprofit organization which meets the 
applicable requirements under this section is entitled to a payment of 
$2,500.
    (b) Business. A business qualifies for payment under this section if 
the Commission determines that--
    (1) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of 
its existing patronage.

[[Page 752]]

    (2) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having 
another establishment, which is not being acquired by the Commission, 
and which is under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar 
business activities. For purposes of this rule, no remaining business 
facility which had average annual gross receipts of less than $1,000 and 
average annual net earnings of less than $500, during the two taxable 
years prior to displacement, shall be considered ``another 
establishment''; and
    (3) The business had (i) average annual gross receipts of at least 
$1,000 during the two taxable years prior to displacement, or (ii) 
average annual net earnings of at least $500 as determined in accordance 
with Sec. 700.173. However, the Commission may waive this test in any 
case in which it determines that its use would cause a substantial 
hardship.
    (c) Determining number of businesses acquired. In determining 
whether two or more legal entities, all of which have been acquired, 
constitute a single business, which is entitled to only one fixed 
payment, all pertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent 
to which--
    (1) The same premises and equipment are shared;
    (2) Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are 
carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;
    (3) The entities are held out to the public, and to those 
customarily dealing with them, as one business, and
    (4) The same person or closely related persons own, control or 
manage the affairs of the entities.
    (d) Farm operation. A farm operation qualifies for a payment under 
this section if the Commission determines that it meets the criteria set 
forth in Sec. 700.171(b)(3). In the case of a partial acquisition, the 
fixed payment shall be made only if the Commission determines that--
    (1) The part acquired was a farm operation before the acquisition; 
or
    (2) The partial acquisition caused the operator to be displaced from 
the farm operation; or
    (3) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the 
nature of the farm operation.
    (e) Nonprofit organization. A nonprofit organization qualifies for a 
$2,500 payment under this section, if the Commission determines that 
it--
    (1) Cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing 
patronage (membership and clientele). A nonprofit organization is 
assumed to meet this test, unless the Commission demonstrates otherwise; 
and
    (2) Is not part of an enterprise having at least one other 
establishment engaged in the same or similar activity which is not being 
acquired by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 700.173  Average net earnings of business or farm.

    (a) Computing net earnings. For purposes of this subpart, the 
average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation is one-half 
of its net earnings before Federal, State and local income taxes, during 
the two taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it 
was displaced. However, if the business or farm was not in operation for 
the full two taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be 
computed on the basis of the actual period of operation on the acquired 
site, projected to an annual rate. Also, average annual net earnings may 
be based upon a different period of time when the Commission determines 
it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained 
from the business or farm operation by its owner, his spouse, or 
dependents.
    (b) Documentation. A displaced person who elects to receive a fixed 
payment in lieu of actual expenses incurred in moving his business or 
farm shall furnish the Commission proof of his net earnings through 
income tax returns, certified financial statements or other reasonable 
evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 700.175  Temporary emergency moves.

    (a) General. An eligible household may be granted temporary 
relocation resources, at the Commission's discretion, provided:

[[Page 753]]

    (1) That the move is for a limited time period not to exceed 12 
months unless extended by the Commission.
    (2) That permanent relocation resources are not available at the 
time of displacement.
    (3) Prior approval of the Commission is obtained.
    (4) That a Relocation Contract providing for permanent relocation 
has been executed.
    (5) The head of household actually remained domiciled on lands 
partitioned to the tribe of which he is not a member as of December 22, 
1974, and continuously thereafter.
    (6) The head of household shall vacate all improvements owned by him 
on lands partitioned to the tribe of which he is not a member and shall 
transfer title to said improvements to the Commission.

Temporary relocation shall in no way diminish the responsibility of the 
Commission to offer relocation assistance and services designed to 
achieve permanent and suitable facilities.
    (b) Conditions under which move to temporary housing accommodations 
may be approved. The move of a family or individual into temporary 
housing accommodations may be approved by the Commission only if the 
following conditions are met.
    (1) The move will be undertaken because:
    (i) It is necessary because of an emergency as determined by the 
Commission; or
    (ii) The individual or family is subject to conditions hazardous to 
his or his family's health or safety.
    (2) The temporary housing is decent, safe, and sanitary.
    (3) The Commission shall have determined that within twelve (12) 
months of the date of the temporary move, replacement housing meeting 
Commission-approved standards will be available for occupancy by the 
persons temporarily rehoused.
    (4) Prior to the move, the Commission shall provide in writing 
assurance to each head of household that:
    (i) Replacement housing will be available at the earliest possible 
time but in any event no later than twelve (12) months from the date of 
the move to temporary housing.
    (ii) Replacement housing will be made available on a priority basis, 
to the individual or family who has been temporarily rehoused.
    (iii) The move to temporary rehousing will not, in any way, affect a 
claimant's eligibility for a replacement housing payment nor deprive him 
of the same choice or replacement housing units that would have been 
made available had the temporary move not been made.
    (iv) The Commission will pay all costs in connection with the move 
to temporary housing, including any increased housing costs.
    (c) Agency documentation. To request Commission approval for a 
temporary move of a family, the following information shall be submitted 
to the Commission (additional information may be required on a case-by-
case basis):
    (1) An explanation of the necessity for the temporary move, based 
upon the criteria set forth by the Commission.
    (2) The estimated duration of the temporary occupancy.
    (3) In the case of the family or individual, (i) a copy of the 
written assurance which will be provided to the person explaining his 
rights and the continuing obligation of the agency to provide relocation 
assistance, and (ii) evidence that the family or individual agrees to 
make the temporary move.
    (d) Costs in connection with temporary move--(1) Costs included. 
Costs included in a temporary move may cover the following:
    (i) Actual reasonable moving costs and related expenses for the move 
to temporary accommodations.
    (ii) For the family or individual moved from a rental unit the 
difference, if any, between the rental cost of the dwelling vacated and 
the rental cost of the temporary unit.
    (iii) For a homeowner who retains ownership of his dwelling the 
reasonable cost of renting the temporary dwelling.
    (iv) For a homeowner whose dwelling has been acquired the 
difference, if any, between his housing costs for the acquired dwelling 
and the rental cost of the temporary unit.
    (2) Costs not a replacement home benefit. Costs in connection with a 
move to

[[Page 754]]

temporary accommodations are not to be considered as relocation payments 
under the Act. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)
    (e) Distinguishing between cost of temporary move and relocation 
payment. The costs of a temporary move, as decribed in the foregoing 
subparagraphs, are not to be considered as all or a part of the 
relocation payment to which a displaced person is entitled under the 
Act. Thus, when a family is moved to temporary accommodations, a 
relocation payment is not made and the election or choice of type of 
payments that would ordinarily be made upon displacement must be delayed 
until the final move is made. When the move out of temporary 
accommodations is made, the displaced person shall receive the full 
relocation payments to which he/she is entitled pursuant to Commission 
regulations.

                 Subpart E--Replacement Housing Payments


<R05>
Sec. 700.181  Eligibility.

    (a) Basic eligibility requirements. A certified eligible head of 
household who established his/her residency requirements in the area 
partitioned to the tribe of which he/she is not a member, is eligible 
for the replacement housing payment specified at Sec. 700.183(a).
    (b) Other rules and requirements. A payment under this subpart E is 
subject to the other applicable rules and requirements of these 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 700.183  Determination of replacement housing benefit.

    (a) Amount of benefit. The replacement housing benefit for a 
certified eligible head-of-household is an amount not to exceed fifty-
five thousand dollars ($55,000) for a household of three or less and not 
to exceed sixty-six thousand dollars ($66,000) for a household of four 
or more. Subject to such other requirements of these regulations as may 
apply, the replacement housing benefit shall be calculated as follows;
    (1) The amount of the fair market value of the habitation and 
improvements purchased from an eligible head-of-household pursuant to 
subpart B of this part shall be applied first toward the cost of a 
replacement dwelling.
    (2) An additional amount shall be added to the value of the 
habitation and improvements to equal the cost of a decent, safe, and 
sanitary replacement dwelling.
    (3) The total value of the replacement dwelling shall not exceed the 
amount of the replacement housing benefit specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (4) In the event the cost of providing a decent, safe, and sanitary 
replacement dwelling is less than the fair market value of the 
habitation and improvements purchased from an eligible head-of-household 
pursuant to subpart B of this part, the difference shall be paid to that 
head-of-household.
    (b) The Commission shall, on or before the first Friday in April of 
each fiscal year, after consultation with the Secretary of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, annually increase, decrease 
or leave unadjusted the above limitations on replacement housing 
benefits to reflect changes in housing or development and construction 
costs, other than costs of land, during the preceding year. In 
determining whether to increase or decrease the replacement housing 
benefit limitations set forth above, the Commission shall consider the 
following:
    (1) The most recent percentage rate of increase or decrease in 
single family housing construction costs reported by HUD. (General 
Prototype Housing Costs For One to Four Family Dwelling Units).
    (2) The most recent Boecht Building Cost Modifier.
    (3) The experience of relocatee families in obtaining replacement 
housing within the current benefits.
    (4) The cost of available replacement housing which meets Commission 
standards as set forth in these regulations.
    (5) Such other available information which the Commission deems 
appropriate and which is relevant to a determination of whether 
replacement housing benefits should be increased or decreased to reflect 
change in housing or development and construction costs during the 
preceding year.

[[Page 755]]

    (c) If the owner retains ownership of his dwelling, moves it from 
the acquired site, and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the purchase 
price of the replacement dwelling shall be considered to be the sum of--
    (1) The cost of the replacement site, if any; plus
    (2) The moving and restoration expenses; plus
    (3) The costs, if any, incurred to make the unit a decent, safe, and 
sanitary replacement dwelling; but not to exceed the above limitation on 
total replacement home benefits.

<R05>
Sec. 700.187  Utilization of replacement home benefits.

    The Commission shall assure that all eligible heads of household 
receive a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling in the 
following manner:
    (a) If the eligible head of household owns no dwelling other than 
that on the area from which he or she must move pursuant to the Act, the 
Commission will make funds available to the head of household as 
provided in these regulations for the acquisition of a replacement home 
in one of the following manners:
    (1) Purchase of an existing home, by the head of household,
    (2) Construction of a home by the head of household,
    (3) Participation or purchase by the head of household in a mutual 
help housing or other home ownership project under the U.S. Housing Act 
of 1937 (50 Stat. 888, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 1401) or in any other 
federally assisted housing program.
    (b) If the eligible head of household owns or is buying or building 
a home in an area other than the area from which he or she must move 
pursuant to the Act, the Commission will expend relocation benefits in 
one of the following manners:
    (1) If the home is decent, safe, and sanitary, but is encumbered by 
a mortgage, such mortgage existing as of the effective date of these 
regulations, the Commission will expend replacement housing benefits up 
to the maximum then existing benefit to accelerate to the maximum extent 
possible the achievement by that household of debt-free home ownership.
    (2) If the home is owned free and clear but does not meet Commission 
decent, safe, and sanitary standards, the Commission will, at its 
discretion, either:
    (i) Expend replacement home benefits for improvements to assure the 
home meets decent, safe, and sanitary standards, or
    (ii) Expend replacement home benefits for the acquisition of a 
replacement dwelling as if the eligible head of household or spouse did 
not own a home as in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) If the home is neither owned free and clear nor decent, safe, 
and sanitary, the Commission will, at its discretion, either:
    (i) Expend replacement home benefits for improvements to assure that 
the home meets decent, safe, and sanitary standards, and to accelerate 
to the maximium extent possible the achievement of debt-free home 
ownership, or
    (ii) Expend replacement home benefits for the acquisition of a 
replacement dwelling as if the eligible head of household or spouse did 
not own a home as in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (d) In implementing these regulations the Commission will encourage 
the use of innovative energy or other technologies in order to achieve 
the minimum monthly housing cost feasible for each replacement house.

<R05>
Sec. 700.189  Expenditure of replacement home benefits.

    Replacement home benefits shall be expended or obligated in full at 
or before the time of original acquisition except as stated below. It is

<R04>
               Subpart H--Last Resort Replacement Housing


<R05>
Sec. 700.209  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart apply only when the Commission

there is a reasonable likelihood that replacement dwelling(s) will not 
be available on a timely basis to person(s) to be displaced.


<R05>
Sec. 700.211  Basic rights and rules.

    The provisions of this subpart do not deprive any displaced person

developed or to be developed under this subpart.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 700.219  General.

    (a) The operation of the Commission shall be governed by a 
Management Manual passed, amended or repealed by a majority of the 
Commission at any regular or special meeting. The Management Manual is 
the prescribed medium for publication of policies, procedures and 
instructions which are necessary to facilitate the day-to-day operations 
and administration of the Commission.
    (b) Meetings. The Commission shall hold a regular monthly meeting on 
the first Friday of each month at a time and place designated by public 
notice unless said Friday falls on a legal holiday, in that event, the 
meeting shall begin on the next regular workday. The monthly meeting may 
continue for as many days thereafter as is necessary to complete the 
regular affairs of the Commission, and may be recessed from time to time 
and reconvened at times designated by the Chairperson.
    (c) Special public meetings. May be called by any Commissioner with 
ten (10) working days written notice given to the other Commissioners. 
Written notice may be waived by a release bearing the signatures of all 
three Commissioners.
    (d) Executive Session. During a regular or special meeting, any 
Commissioner may request an Executive Session for purposes of personnel 
and administrative matters.
    (e) Compliance with other laws and regulations. As a federal agency,

applicable federal statutes and administrative procedures.


<R04>
                    Subpart J--Inspection of Records


<R05>
Sec. 700.235  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart contains the regulations of the Commission 
implementing the requirement of subsection (a)(3) of the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), which provides that the Commission 
``upon any request for records which (1) Reasonably describes

[[Page 758]]

such records and (2) is made in accordance with published rules stating 
the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall 
make the records promptly available to any person.'' This subpart 
describes the procedures by which records may be obtained from the 
Commission. The procedures in this subpart are not applicable to 
requests for records published in the Federal Register or opinions in 
the adjudication of cases, statements of policy and interpretations and 
administrative staff manuals which have been published or made available 
under subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 700.237  Definitions.

    Act. As used in this subpart, ``Act'' means the ``Freedom of 
Information Act,'' 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 700.239  Records available.

    (a) Commission policy. It is the policy of the Commission to make 
the records of the Commission available to the public to the greatest 
extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    (b) Statutory disclosure requirement. The Freedom of Information Act 
requires that the Commission, on a request from a member of the public 
to inspect or copy records made in accordance with the procedures in 
this subpart, shall promptly make the records available.
    (c) Statutory exemptions. The Act exempts nine categories of records 
from this disclosure requirement. The Act provides that disclosure is 
not required of matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
Executive Order;
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency;
    (3) Specifically exempt from disclosure by statute;
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the agency;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but 
only to the extent that production of such records would
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Disclose the indentity of a confidential source and, in the 
case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source,
    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;
    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition 
reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; 
or
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (d) Decisions on requests. It is the policy of the Commission to 
withhold information falling within an exemption only if (1) disclosure 
is prohibited by statute or Executive Order or (2) sound grounds exist 
for invocation of the exemption.
    (e) Deletion of portions of records. If a requested record contains 
material within an exemption together with material not within an 
exemption and it is determined under the regulations in this subpart to 
withhold the exempt material, any reasonably segregable nonexempt 
material shall be separated from the exempt material.
    (f) Creation of records. This subpart applies only to records which 
exist at the time a request for records is made. Records are not 
required to be created in response to a request by combining

[[Page 759]]

or compiling selected items from the files or by preparing a new 
computer program, nor are records required to be created to provide the 
requester with such data as proportions, percentages, frequency 
distributions, trends, or comparisons.
    (g) Records of concern to other departments and agencies. (1) If the 
release of a record would be of concern to both the Commission and 
another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the 
Commission only if the interest of the Commission is the primary 
interest. If the Commission's interest is not the primary interest, the 
requester shall be referred in writing to the agency having the primary 
interest. The Commission has the primary interest in a record if the 
record was developed pursuant to Commission regulations, directives, or 
request even though the record originated outside of the Commission.
    (2) If the release of a record in which the Commission has a primary 
interest would be of substantial concern to another agency, the official 
processing the request, should, if administratively feasible and 
appropriate, consult with that agency before releasing the record.
    (h) Records obtained from the public. If a requested record was 
obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the 
Government, the official responsible for processing the request shall, 
when it is administratively feasible to do so, seek the views of that 
person or entity on whether the record should be released before making 
a decision on the request.


<R05>
Sec. 700.241  Request for records.

    (a) Submission of requests. A request to inspect or copy records 
shall be made to the installation where the records are located. If the 
records are located at more than one installation or if the specific 
location of the records is not known to the person wishing to inspect or 
copy the records, he may direct his request to the head of the 
appropriate bureau, or the bureau's chief public information officer, if 
any.
    (b) Form of request. (1) Requests invoking the Freedom of 
Information Act shall be in writing.
    (2)(i) A request must reasonably describe the records requested. A 
request reasonably describes the records requested if it will enable an 
employee of the Commission familiar with the subject area of the request 
to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. If such 
information is available, the request should identify the subject matter 
of the record, the date when it was made, the place where it was made, 
and the person or office that made it, the present custodian of the 
record, and any other information which will assist in location of the 
requested records. If the request involves a matter known by the 
requester to be in litigation, the request should also state the case 
name and court hearing the case.
    (ii) If the description of a record sought is insufficient to allow 
identification and location of the record, the response denying the 
request on this ground shall so state and, to the extent possible, 
indicate what additional descriptive information, if any, would assist 
in location of the record.
    (3) A request shall state the maximum amount of fees which the 
requester is willing to pay. Requesters are notified that under 
Sec. 700.251, the failure to state willingness to pay fees as high as 
are anticipated by the Commission will delay running of the time limit 
and delay processing of the request, if the responsible official 
anticipates that the fees chargeable may exceed $25.00.
    (4)(i) To insure expeditious handling, requests shall be prominently 
marked, both on the envelope and on the face of the request, with the 
legend ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.'' The failure of a request to 
bear such a legend will not disqualify a request from processing under 
the procedures in this subpart if the request otherwise meets the 
requirments of this section. A request not bearing the legend ``FREEDOM 
OF INFORMATION REQUEST'' will not, however, be deemed to have been 
received for purposes of the running of the time limit set out in 
Sec. 700.245 until it has been identified by bureau personnel as a 
Freedom of Information request and marked by them with this legend.

[[Page 760]]

    (ii) Commission personnel identifying a communication from the 
public not bearing the legend ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST'' as a 
request otherwise meeting the requirements of this section shall 
immediately (A) mark the communication with the legend ``FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION REQUEST.'' (B) date the request to reflect the date on which 
it was identified, and (C) take steps to assure proper processing of the 
request under the procedures in this subpart.
    (d) Categorical requests. (1) A request for all records falling 
within a reasonably specific category shall be regarded as conforming to 
the statutory requirement that records be reasonably described if (i) it 
can be determined which particular records are covered by the request 
and (ii) the records can be searched for, collected and produced without 
unduly burdening or interfering with Commission operations because of 
the staff time consumed or the resulting disruption of the files.
    (2) If a categorical request is determined under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section not to reasonably describe the records requested, the 
response denying the request on that ground shall specify the reasons 
why and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with 
knowledgeable Commission personnel in an attempt to reduce the request 
to manageable proportions by reformulation and by agreeing on an orderly 
procedure for the production of the records.


<R05>
Sec. 700.243  Action on initial requests.

    (a) Granting of requests. (1) A requested record shall be made 
available if (i) the record is not exempt from disclosure or (ii) the 
record is exempt from disclosure, but its withholding is neither 
required by statute or Executive order nor supported by sound grounds.
    (b) Form of grant. (1) When a requested record has been determined 
to be available, the official processing the request shall immediately 
notify the person requesting the record as to where and when the record 
is available for inspection or as the case may be, where and when copies 
will be available. If fees are due under Sec. 700.251, the responsible 
official shall also state the amount or, if the exact amount cannot be 
determined, the approximate amount of fees due.
    (2) If the record was obtained by the Commission from a person or 
entity outside of the Government, the responsible official shall, when 
it is administratively feasible to do so, notify that person or entity 
that the record has been made available.
    (c) Denial of requests. (1) A request for a record may be denied 
only if it is determined that (i) the record is exempt from disclosure 
and (ii) that withholding of the record is required by statute or 
Executive order or supported by sound grounds.
    (2) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be denied only by 
the Freedom of Information Act Officer or by an official whom the 
Executive Director has in writing designated.
    (d) Form of denial. A reply denying a request shall be in writing 
and shall include:
    (1) A reference to the specific exemption or exemptions under the 
Freedom of Information Act authorizing the withholding of the record;
    (2) The sound ground for withholding;
    (3) A listing of the names and titles or positions of each person 
responsible for the denial;
    (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Commission 
pursuant to Sec. 700.247 and that such appeal must be in writing and be 
received by this official within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, 
and public legal holidays excepted) after the date of the denial, in the 
case of the denial of an entire request, or within twenty (20) days 
(Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) of records 
being made available, in the case of a partial denial, by writing to the 
Freedom of Information Act Officer, Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation 
Commission, P.O. Box KK, Flagstaff, Arizona 86002.
    (e) Exception. The requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section do not apply to requests denied under Sec. 2.14 on the 
ground that the request did not reasonably describe the records 
requested or to requests for records which do not exist.

[[Page 761]]

    (f) Filing of denials. Copies of all replies denying, in whole or 
part, a request for a record which are issued under this section of 
Sec. 700.243 shall be promptly submitted by the Freedom of Information 
Act Officer, denials to the Executive Director and the Commission's 
legal counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 700.245  Time limits on processing of initial requests.

    (a) Basic limit. Requests for records shall be processed promptly. A 
determination whether to grant or deny a request shall be made within no 
more than ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) after receipt of a request. This determination shall be 
communicated immediately to the requester.
    (b) Running of basic time limit. For purposes of paragraph (a) of 
this section, the time limit commences to run when a request is received 
at the Commission's office in Flagstaff, Arizona.
    (c) Extensions of time. In the following unusual circumstances, the 
time limit for acting upon an initial request may be extended to the 
extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular 
request, but in no case may the time limit be extended for more than ten 
(10) working days:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
    (d) Authority to make extensions. (1) An extension of time under 
paragraph (c) of this section may be made only by the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer or such higher authority as the Commission has 
in writing designated.
    (2) The person requesting the records shall be notified in writing 
of the extension. The written notice shall state the reason for the 
extension and the date on which a determination on the request is 
expected to be dispatched.
    (3) The Freedom of Information Act Officer shall be responsible for 
promptly furnishing copies of such notices to the Executive Director and 
the Commission's legal counsel.
    (e) Treatment of delay as denial. (1) If no determination has been 
reached at the end of the ten (10) day period for deciding an initial 
request, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem his 
request denied and may exercise a right of appeal in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 700.247.
    (2) When no determination can be reached within the applicable time 
limit, the responsible official shall nevertheless continue to process 
the request. On expiration of the time limit, the responsible official 
shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, of the date on 
which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of his right 
to treat the delay as a denial for purposes of appeal to the Commission 
in accordance with Sec. 700.247. The requester may be asked to consider 
delaying use of his right to appeal until the date on which the 
determination is expected to be dispatched. If the requester so agrees, 
he is deemed not to have treated the failure to respond within the 
applicable time limit as a denial for purposes of the running of the 
twenty (20) working-day appeal period set out in Sec. 700.247. If a 
determination of the request is not issued by the new agreed upon date, 
or if the request is denied in whole or part, the requester will have 
available his full right of appeal under Sec. 700.247, including the 
entire twenty (20) working-day period for filing of the appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 700.247  Appeals.

    (a) Right of appeal. Where a request for records has been denied, in 
whole or part, the person submitting the request may appeal the denial 
to the Commission.
    (b) Time for appeal. An appeal must be received no later than twenty 
(20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after 
the date of the initial denial, in the case of a denial of an entire 
request, or twenty (20) days

[[Page 762]]

(Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after records 
have been made available, in the case of a partial denial.
    (c) Form of appeal. (1) An appeal shall be initiated by filing a 
written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of 
the original request and the initial denial and should, in order to 
expedite the appellate process and give the requester an opportunity to 
present his arguments, contain a brief statement of the reasons why the 
requester believes the initial denial to have been in error.
    (2) The appeal shall be addressed to Freedom of Information Act 
Officer, Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, P.O. Box KK, 
Flagstaff, Arizona 86002.
    (3)(i) Both the envelope containing the notice of appeal and the 
face of the notice shall bear the legend ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 
APPEAL''. The failure of an appeal to bear such a legend will not 
disqualify an appeal from processing under Sec. 2.18 if the appeal 
otherwise meets the requirements of this section. An appeal not bearing 
the legend ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL'' will not, however, be 
deemed to have been received for purposes of the running of the time 
limit set out in Sec. 700.249 until it has been identified by Commission 
personnel as a Freedom of Information appeal and marked by them with 
this legend.
    (ii) Commission personnel identifying a communication from the 
public not bearing the legend ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL'' as an 
appeal otherwise meeting the requirements of this section shall 
immediately (A) mark the communication with the legend ``FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION APPEAL,'' (B) date the appeal to reflect the date on which 
it was identified, and (C) take steps to assure proper processing of the 
appeal under the procedures in this subpart.
    (4) The Freedom of Information Act Officer shall be responsible for 
promptly furnishing copies of such notices to the Executive Director and 
the Commission's legal counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 700.249  Action on appeals.

    (a) Authority. Appeals from initial denials of requests for records 
shall be decided for the Commission by the Executive Director after 
consultation with the Commission's legal counsel.
    (b) Time limit. A final determination on any appeal shall be made 
within twenty (20) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal 
holidays) after receipt of the appeal.
    (c) Extensions of time. (1) If the time limit for responding to the 
initial request for a record was not extended under the provisions of 
Sec. 700.245 or was extended for fewer than ten (10) working days, the 
time for processing of the appeal may be extended by the Executive 
Director to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of 
the appeal, but in no event may the extension, when taken together with 
any extension made during processing of the initial request, result in 
an aggregate extension with respect to any one request of more than ten 
(10) working days. The time for processing of an appeal may be extended 
only if one or more of the unusual circumstances listed in 
Sec. 700.245(c) requires an extension.
    (2) The Executive Director shall, in writing, advise the appellant 
of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a final 
determination of the appeal is expected to be dispatched.
    (3) If no determination on the appeal has been reached at the end of 
the twenty (20) working-day period for deciding an appeal, or the last 
extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted his 
administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district 
court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When no 
determination can be reached within the applicable time limit, the 
appeal will nevertheless continue to be processed. On expiration of the 
time limit, the requester shall be informed of the reason for the delay, 
of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, 
and of his right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to 
consider delaying resort to his right to judicial review until the date 
on which the determination on his appeal is expected to be dispatched.

[[Page 763]]

    (d) Form of decision. The final determination on an appeal shall be 
in writing and shall state the basis for the determination. If the 
determination is to release the requested records or portions thereof, 
the Freedom of Information Act Officer shall immediately make the 
records available or instruct the appropriate bureau official to make 
them immediately available. If the determination upholds in whole or 
part the initial denial of a request for records, the determination 
shall advise the requester of his right to obtain judicial review in the 
U.S. District Court for the district in which the withheld records are 
located, or in which the requester resides or has his principal place of 
business or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and 
shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person 
responsible for the denial.
    (e) Distribution of copies. Copies of final determinations issued by 
the Commission shall be provided to the Commission's legal counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 700.251  Fees.

    (a) Services for which fees may be charged. (1) Unless waived 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, user fees 
shall be charged for document search and duplication costs incurred in 
responding to requests for records. User fees also shall be charged for 
the formal certification of verification attached to authenticated 
copies of records under the seal of the Commission.
    (2) Unless waived or reduced pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, user fees shall be charged in accordance with the schedule of 
charges contained in the Commission's Management Manual.
    (b) Services for which fees may not be charged. No fee may be 
charged for any services required by the Freedom of Information Act to 
be performed in responding to a request for records other than those 
services for which fees may be charged under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Services for which no fees may be charged include, but are not 
limited to,
    (1) Examining requested records to determine whether they are exempt 
from mandatory disclosure or whether, even if exempt, they should 
nevertheless be made available in whole or part,
    (2) Deleting exempt matter from records so that the remaining 
portions of the records may be made available,
    (3) Monitoring a requester's inspection of agency records made 
available to him for inspection, and
    (4) Resolving legal and policy issues affecting access to requested 
records.
    (c) Waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Fees otherwise chargeable for 
document search and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests 
for records may be waived or reduced, as appropriate, if the official 
making the records available determines that furnishing the records can 
be considered as primarily benefiting the public as opposed to the 
requester.
    (2) Fees otherwise applicable for document research and duplication 
costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived and not charged 
if the request involves:
    (i) Furnishing unauthenticated copies of any documents reproduced 
for gratuitous distribution;
    (ii) Furnishing one copy of a personal document (e.g., a birth 
certificate) to a person who has been required to furnish it for 
retention by the Commission;
    (iii) Furnishing one copy of the transcript of a hearing before a 
hearing officer in a grievance or similar proceeding to the employee for 
whom the hearing was held.
    (3) Fees otherwise chargeable for document search and duplication 
costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived or reduced if the 
cost of collecting the fee would exceed the amount of the fee or if the 
request involves:
    (i) Furnishing records to press, radio and television 
representatives for dissemination through the media to the general 
public;
    (ii) Furnishing records to donors with respect to their gifts;
    (iii) Furnishing records to individuals or private non-profit 
organizations having an official voluntary or cooperative relationship 
with the Commission to assist the individual or organization in its work 
with the Commission;
    (iv) Furnishing records to state, local and tribal governments and 
public

[[Page 764]]

international organizations when to do so without charge is an 
appropriate courtesy, or when the recipient is carrying on a function 
related to that of the Commission and to do so will help to accomplish 
the work of the Commission;
    (v) Furnishing records when to do so saves costs and yields income 
equal to the direct cost of providing the records (e.g., where the 
Commission's fee for the service would be included in a billing against 
the Commission);
    (vi) Furnishing records when to do so is in conformance with 
generally established business custom (e.g., furnishing personal 
reference data to prospective employers of former Commission employees);
    (vii) Furnishing one copy of a record in order to assist the 
requester to obtain financial benefits to which he is entitled (e.g., 
veterans or their dependents, employees with Government employee 
compensation claims or persons insured by the Government).
    (d) Notice of anticipated fees and prepayment. (1) Where it is 
anticipated that fees chargeable under this section may amount to more 
than $25.00 and the requester has not indicated in advance his 
willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the request shall be 
deemed not to have been received for purposes of the time limits 
established by Sec. 700.245 until the requester is advised of the fees 
which are anticipated and has agreed to pay these fees. Advice to 
requesters with respect to anticipated fees shall be provided promptly.
    (2) The appropriate cases, advance payment of fees may be required 
before requested records are made available to the requester.
    (3) A notice of anticipated fees or notice of request for advance 
payment shall extend an offer to the requester to confer with 
appropriate personnel in an attempt to reformulate the request in a 
manner which will reduce the anticipated fees and meet the needs of the 
requester.
    (e) Form of payment. Payment of fees shall be made by check or money 
order payable to the Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission. The term 
United States or the initials ``U.S.'' shall not be included on the 
check or money order. Where appropriate, the official responsible for 
handling a request may require that payment by check be made in the form 
of a certified check.

<R05>
Sec. 700.261  Standards for maintenance of records subject to the Act.

    (a) Content of records. Records subject to the Privacy Act shall 
contain only such information about an individual as is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be 
accomplished by statute or Executive Order of the President.
    (b) Standards of accuracy. Records subject to the Privacy Act which 
are used in making any determination about any individual shall be 
maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness 
as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in 
making the determination.
    (c) Collection of information. (1) Information which may be used in 
making determination about an individual's rights, benefits, and 
privileges under Federal programs shall, to the greatest extent 
practicable, be collected directly from that individual.
    (2) In deciding whether collection of information from an 
individual, as opposed to a third party source, is practicable, the 
following factors, among others may be considered:
    (i) Whether the nature of the information sought is such that it can 
only be obtained from a third party;
    (ii) Whether the cost of collecting the information from the 
individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it 
from a third party;
    (iii) Whether there is a risk that information collected from third 
parties if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination to the 
individual concerned;
    (iv) Whether the information, if supplied by the individual, would 
have to be verified by a third party; or
    (v) Whether provisions can be made for verification, by the 
individual, of information collected from third parties.
    (d) Advice to individual concerning uses of information. (1) Each 
individual who is asked to supply information about himself which will 
be added to a system of records shall be informed of the basis for 
requesting the information, how it may be used, and what the 
consequences, if any, are of not supplying the information.
    (2) At a minimum, the notice to the individual must state;
    (i) The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of 
the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and 
whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;
    (ii) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is 
intended to be used;
    (iii) The routine uses which may be made of the information; and

[[Page 766]]

    (iv) The effects on him, if any, of not providing all or any part of 
the requested information.
    (3)(i) When information is collected on a standard form, the notice 
to the individual shall be on the form or on a tear-off sheet attached 
to the form or on a separate sheet, whichever is most practical.
    (ii) When information is collected by an interviewer, the 
interviewer shall provide the individual with a written notice which the 
individual may retain. If the interview is conducted by telephone, 
however, the interviewer may summarize the notice for the individual and 
need not provide a copy to the individual unless the individual requests 
that a copy be mailed to him.
    (iii) An individual may be asked to acknowledge, in writing, that he 
has been afforded the notice required by this section.
    (e) Records concerning activity protected by the First Amendment. No 
record may be maintained describing how any individual exercises rights 
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution unless (1) 
expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the 
record is maintained or (2) pertinent to and within the scope of an 
authorized law enforcement activity.


<R05>
Sec. 700.263  Assuring integrity of records.

Sec. 700.275  Requests for access to records.

    The Privacy Act permits an individual, upon his request, to gain

all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensive to him, 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d)(1). A request for access shall be submitted in accordance with

indicated he/she is willing to pay, the official processing the request 
shall notify the requester and shall not complete processing of the 
request until the requester has agreed, in writing, to pay fees as high 
as are anticipated.

alternate Agency Ethics Official in the absence of the Designated Agency 
Ethics Official, or upon his or her express delegation. Specific duties

Agency Ethics Official shall establish and maintain close working 
relations with the OGE, and shall coordinate communications between the

Ethics Official receives a request which he or she believes should be 
answered by the Office of Government Ethics, a referral procedure is 
available. Requests for advisory opinions shall be submitted as 
specified in 5 CFR 738.304. The Designated Agency Ethics Official shall 
provide the OGE with records, reports and any other information which

amended) or requested by the OGE.
    (b) Review of statements. The Designated Agency Ethics Official 
shall review the statements of employment and financial interest

interest laws and regulations to the information reported. When the 
review discloses a conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between 
the private interests of an employee and the performance of his or her 
duties as a Commission employee, the Designated Agency Ethics Official 
shall bring the conflict to the attention of the employee, grant the 
individual an opportunity to explain the conflict, and attempt to 
resolve it. If the conflict is not resolved at this point, the 
Designated Agency Ethics Official shall forward a written report on the 
conflict to the Chairman of the Commission recommending appropriate 
action. In developing the recommendation the Designated Agency Ethics 
Official may consult, as appropriate, with the agency General Counsel 
and the GSA Ethics Office.
    (c) Education and counseling program. The Designated Agency Ethics

positions meet the criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (5) Special Government Employees shall file NHIRC form 738.2F with 
the Designated Agency Ethics Official prior to beginning employment or 
service with the Commission. The Designated Agency Ethics Official may 
waive this requirement if the duties of the position held by the special 
Government employee are of a nature or at such a level of responsibility 
that the submission of the statement by the incumbent is not necessary 
to protect the integrity of the Commission or the Government.
    (b) Criteria for selection of positions subject to filing 
requirements. The following criteria govern selection of employees who 
must also file statements of Employment and Financial Interest (NHIRC 
Form 738.1F) with the Designated Agency Ethics Official.
    (1) Statements of Employment and Financial Interest shall be 
required of employees holding positions which are responsible for:
    (i) Contracting or procurement.
    (ii) Administering or monitoring grants and subcontracts.
    (iii) Other activities where the decision or action has an economic 
impact on the interests of any person or non-Federal enterprise.
    (2) When a new position is established or the duties of an existing 
position are materially changed, the position shall be evaluated 
pursuant to the criteria of this section to determine whether or not it 
should be designated as one requiring the incumbent to submit a 
Statement of Employment and Financial Interests.
    (c) Interests of relatives. The interest of a spouse, minor child, 
or other member of an employee's immediate household is considered to be 
an interest of the employee. Reports must include but are not limited to 
identification of such an individual's employer, financial holdings and 
debts. These provisions also apply to special Government employees.
    (d) Employee complaint against filing requirements. An employee who 
believes that his or her position has been improperly included among 
those requiring the submission of a Statement of Employment and 
Financial Interests may obtain review through the Commission's 
administrative grievance procedure.
    (e) Procedures for obtaining statements. Following approval of these 
regulations, the Designated Agency Ethics Official shall give each 
employee and special Government employee required to file under this 
part, a copy of the appropriate NHIRC form. An enclosure with the form 
shall advise that:
    (1) The completed form shall be returned in a sealed envelope marked 
``personal-in confidence'' to the Designated Agency Ethics Official 
within 30 days.
    (2) The services of the Designated Agency Ethics Official are 
available to assist and advise in preparation of the statement.

[[Page 788]]

    (3) Any additions or deletions to the information furnished must be 
reported within 30 days of the time they occur, or in the case of a 
special Government employee, at the time the change occurs, and
    (4) No later than June 1 of each year all employees and special 
Government employees required to file under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section shall file an annual supplementary statement to update the 
information previously filed.
    (5) New employees required to file under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section shall submit a statement within 30 days of beginning employment 
with the Commission.
    (e) Confidentiality of statements. Statements of employment and 
financial interest shall be held in confidence. Access to information 
from the statements shall not be disclosed except to carry out the 
purpose of this directive.
    (f) Resolving conflicts of interest. When the Designated Agency 
Ethics Official determines from review of the statement that a conflict 
of interest may exist, the submitter shall have the opportunity to 
provide additional information, which shall become part of the record. 
The Designated Agency Ethics Official and the concerned employee shall 
make every effort to resolve the conflict in a manner that is mutually 
acceptable. If these efforts are not successful the Designated Agency 
Ethics Official shall forward a report and recommendation to the 
Chairman of the Commission for final action. Remedial action directed by 
the Chairman may include but is not limited to:
    (1) Disqualification for a particular assignment.
    (2) Change in assigned duties.
    (3) Divestment of the employee or special Government employee of the 
conflicting interests.
    (4) Disciplinary action, including removal.


<R05>
Sec. 700.513  Business dealings on behalf of the government.

    (a) All employees shall conduct themselves on the job so as to 
efficiently discharge the work of the Commission. Employees shall 
observe courtesy, consideration and promptness in dealing with clients, 
other governmental agencies, and members of the public.
    (b) Commission personnel conducting business with contractors, 
realtors, vendors, service providers and other public and private 
agencies, organizations, business and individuals shall maintain strict 
impartiality in their business dealings. Commission employees shall not 
allow themselves to be placed in a position in which a conflict of 
interest might arise or might justifiably be suspected. Such a conflict 
may arise or appear to arise by the acceptance of gratuities or by any 
action which could reasonably be interpreted as influencing the strict 
impartiality that must prevail in all business relationships involving 
the Commission. However, this requirement of impartiality is not 
intended to prohibit advocacy of client interests, as is required as a 
stated duty of certain agency positions. Such advocacy may occur for 
example during warrantee representation or during technical 
representation with builders.


<R05>
Sec. 700.515  Conflicts of interest.

    (a) A conflict of interest may exist when an employee uses, or 
appears to use, his or her official position to obtain benefits for 
himself or herself, close friends, relatives, or business associates. A 
conflict of interest may also exist if an employee's private activities 
interfere with the proper discharge of his or her official duties. If an 
employee has any doubt about whether or not a particular situation is, 
or gives the appearance of being a conflict of interest, the situation 
should be discussed with the immediate supervisor. Should further review 
be required, the Designated Agency Ethics Official shall be consulted.
    (b) Principal situations where conflict of interest may develop are 
regulated by the sections which follow. However, these regulations do 
not preclude other conflict of interest situations which may arise in 
connection with the work of the Commission.
    (c) These prohibitions apply to all Commission employees, whether or 
not they are required to file financial and employment disclosure 
statements.

[[Page 789]]


<R05>
Sec. 700.517  Affiliations and financial interests.

    (a) Commission personnel shall not engage in any personal, business, 
or professional activity, or receive or retain any direct or indirect 
financial interest, which places them in a position of conflict or 
apparent conflict between their private interests and the public 
interests of the United States as related to the duties of their 
Commission positions.
    (b) Employees are prohibited from accepting money, goods or services 
other than official compensation for any act performed by the employee 
as part of his or her official duties.
    (c) Commission personnel shall not use, directly or indirectly, 
inside information for private gain for themselves, family members, or 
others if that information is not generally available to the public and 
was obtained as a result of Commission employment.
    (d) Commission personnel are prohibited from using their official 
positions to induce, coerce, or in any manner influence any person, 
including subordinates, to provide any improper benefit, financial or 
otherwise, to themselves or others.
    (e) Employees may not have any personal interest in transactions 
which are directed, regulated, or effected by the Commission pursuant to 
the authorities vested in the agency by Pub. L. 93-531 and Pub. L. 96-
395. Specifically:
    (1) No Commission employee shall have a personal interest in a 
contract, subcontract, memorandum of understanding or agreement, or 
other arrangement resulting in payment for the delivery of goods, 
services, or supplies to the Commission, to the Navajo or Hopi tribal 
governments, or to individual relocatees or groups of relocatees.
    (2) No Commission employee shall have or seek an interest in real or 
personal property acquired for transfer to the Navajo or Hopi Tribes.
    (3) No Commission employee shall have or seek an interest in any 
activity supported financially by the Commission through the award of 
Discretionary Funds.
    (4) During the process of acquiring replacement housing for 
relocatees no employee may have a personal interest in the activities of 
a contractor, realtor, or other business entity selected by the 
relocatee to furnish replacement housing; nor may the employee influence 
the relocatee to select any realtor, contractor or other business entity 
with which the employee has personal or business affiliations.
    (5) Nothing in this section shall restrict a relocatee's right to 
exercise free and independent judgment in selecting a realtor, 
contractor, or other vendor or service provider; regardless of any 
personal or business relationship of that entity to a Commission 
employee, provided the employee has not influenced the choice of the 
relocatee in any manner.
    (6) Nothing in this section shall restrict a Commission employee who 
is eligible for relocation benefits from applying for and obtaining such 
benefits according to published criteria; nor to prevent the Commission 
from employing a member of the Hopi or Navajo Tribe who has been, or is 
in the process, of being relocated pursuant to the law.
    (7) Commission employees shall disqualify themselves from 
investigating and preparing recommendations regarding eligibility 
determination for applicants to whom they are closely related by blood 
or marriage.


<R05>
Sec. 700.519  Gifts, entertainment and favors.

    (a) Acceptance of gratuities, including gifts, entertainment and 
favors, (no matter how innocently tendered or received) from those who 
have or seek business dealings with the Commission, is prohibited as it 
may be a source of embarrassment to the recipient, and may impair public 
confidence in the integrity of the conduct of the Government's business. 
It is emphasized that prohibited conflicts and apparent conficts of 
interest can sometimes arise even from relationships and transactions 
that the persons concerned perceive as inconsequential.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, 
Commission personnel and their spouses, minor children and members of 
their households shall not solicit nor accept, either directly or 
indirectly, any gift,

[[Page 790]]

gratuity, favor, entertainment loan or any other thing of monetary value 
from any person who:
    (1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or 
financial relations with the Commission,
    (2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the 
Commission or significantly affected by Commission decisions, or
    (3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or non-performance of the employee's official duty.
    (c) Employees are specifically prohibited from accepting gifts or 
favors from vendors, contractors, builders, realtors, tribal officials 
or other individuals with whom Commission employees do business. This 
prohibition extends to the acceptance of meals and refreshments offered 
by individuals conducting or seeking business with the Commission 
whether during duty or non-duty hours.
    (d) The following circumstances are excepted from the prohibitions 
listed above:
    (1) An employee may accept unsolicited advertising or promotional 
material with the name of the company imprinted, such as pencils, 
calendars and similar items of nominal intrinsic value.
    (2) An employee may accept transportation and meals provided by a 
contractor in connection with official business when arrangements for 
Government or commercial transportation or meals are clearly 
impracticable and the supervisor has granted prior approval.
    (3) An employee may accept an invitation extended by a relocatee to 
attend a housewarming, potluck, accept a meal and refreshments while 
traveling on the reservation, or similar social activity when 
circumstances would make it rude for the employee to refuse.
    (4) Other circumstances may arise in which it would be to the 
Commission's advantage for an employee to participate in activities 
ordinarily prohibited. In such cases, the employee shall consult with 
his or her supervisor about the course of action to be followed. If 
prior consultation is not possible, the employee shall exercise prudent 
judgement and promptly inform the supervisor of the activity.


<R05>
Sec. 700.521  Outside work and interests.

    Commission employees may engage in outside work or other activity 
which does not create a conflict between the employee's private 
interests and official duties nor prevent employees from devoting their 
talents and energies to the Commission. An employee's outside work shall 
not reflect discredit upon the Commission.
    (a) Employees engaged in or considering outside employment shall 
inform their supervisor of the work, and supply such additional details 
as may be required to determine whether the employment is compatible 
with the full and proper discharge of the employee's official duties.
    (b) Similarly, employees shall inform the supervisor and request 
approval of other types of outside activities which may present an 
actual or apparent conflict of interest between the employees' official 
duties and their private lives. The supervisor shall determine if the 
outside employment or activity is prohibited by these regulations, and 
so inform the employee. The Designated Agency Ethics Official is 
available to assist supervisors in making such determinations.
    (c) Guidelines and limitations. Outside employment or other outside 
activity is incompatible with the full and proper discharge of an 
employee's duties and responsibilities and hence is prohibited if:
    (1) It would involve the violation of a Federal or State statute, a 
local ordinance, Executive Order, or regulation to which the employee is 
subject.
    (2) It would be of such extent or nature as to interfere with the 
efficient performance of the employee's Government duties, or impair the 
employee's mental or physical capacity to perform them in an acceptable 
manner.
    (3) It would tend to influence the exercise or impartial judgement 
on any matters coming before the employee in the course of his or her 
duties;
    (4) It would involve work for contractors, subcontractors, realtors, 
tribal offices, clients or other entities and individuals which have 
business with or receive services from the Commission or

[[Page 791]]

conduct activities which are regulated by the Commission.
    (5) Involves a person or enterprise that may be substantially 
affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official 
duties.
    (6) It involves the use of the employee's time during official 
working hours.
    (7) It involves the receipt of salary or anything of monetary value 
from a private source as compensation for services to the Government.
    (8) It involves acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of 
expense, or any other thing of monetary value under circumstances in 
which acceptance might result in, or create the appearance of, a 
conflict of interest.
    (9) It would be of a nature which might be construed by the general 
public to be an official act of the Commission, or would give the 
impression that a business or product which is involved in the 
relocation project is officially endorsed or approved by the Commission.
    (10) It would involve use by the employee of official facilities, 
e.g., office space, office machines, or supplies, or the services of 
other employees during duty hours.
    (11) It might bring discredit upon, or cause unfavorable criticism 
of, the Government or the Commission or lead to relationships which 
might impair public confidence in the integrity of the Government or the 
Commission.
    (12) It would involve the use of information obtained as a result of 
Government employment that is not freely available to the general public 
in that it either has not been made available to the general public or 
would not be made available upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 700.523  Business relationships among employees.

    Business relationships among Commission employees which take place 
after working hours and away from Commission premises are not matters 
for regulation, unless they violate the restrictions listed above.


<R05>
Sec. 700.525  Use of government information or expertise.

    (a) Commission personnel may engage in teaching, lecturing and 
writing about the relocation program, provided the Information which 
they present is public knowledge or would be made available to the 
public upon request.
    (b) Employees shall inform their supervisors in advance of any 
teaching, writing, or lecturing activity which relates to the Commission 
operations. The Commissioners may at their discretion exercise the right 
of review and approval of materials to be presented.
    (c) Employees must obtain supervisory approval for release of 
information considered confidential, and release of information not 
previously published as public information.
    (d) Disclosure of information from records shall conform with the 
provisions of the Freedom of information and the Privacy Acts (5 U.S.C. 
552). An employee may not release confidential information maintained by 
the Commission and available to the employee because of his position as 
an employee of the Commission. Violation of this prohibition may result 
in prosecution under the terms of the Privacy Act in addition to any 
disciplinary penalties levied by the employee's supervisor.
    (e) Commission personnel may not accept compensation for an article, 
speech, consultant service, or other activity if it involves the use of 
information obtained as the result of Government employment which is not 
available to the general public as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, or results in an actual or appearance of conflict of interest.
    (f) Unless there is a definite Commission position on a matter which 
is the subject of an employee's writing or speech, and the individual 
has been authorized by the Commissioners to present that position 
officially, the employee shall expressly present his or her views on the 
matter as his or her own and not as those of the Commission.
    (g) The right of an employee to express personal opinions is 
respected. However, once the Commission has established policy and 
procedure, every employee is obligated to carry out all lawful 
regulations, orders, and assignments, and to support the programs of the 
Commission as long as they are part of recognized public policy.
    (h) In dealing with the public and with relocatees, employees should

[[Page 792]]

avoid issuing opinions or decisions contrary to Commission policy which 
can be mistaken as official Commission policy.


<R05>
Sec. 700.527  Endorsements.

    Employees are prohibited from endorsing in an official capacity 
business products or processes or the services of commercial firms for 
advertising publicity or sale purposes. Use of materials, products or 
services, by the Commission does not constitute official endorsement. 
Employees may not recommend for or against any particular builder, 
supplier, realtor, contractor or other person or business seeking to 
sell any product or service to relocatees.


<R05>
Sec. 700.529  Negotiations for employment.

    An employee shall inform the supervisor and seek the advice of the 
Designated Agency Ethics Official if he or she wishes to negotiate for 
future non-Federal employment with persons or organizations having 
business with the Commission if the employee is involved in making 
recommendations or decisions affecting those persons or organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 700.531   Government property.

    Employees shall be held accountable for Government property and 
monies entrusted to their individual use or in connection with their 
official duties. An employee has a positive duty to protect and conserve 
Government property and to use it economically and for official purposes 
only, for example:
    (a) Only official documents and materials may be reproduced on 
Government reproduction equipment.
    (b) Government vehicles may be used only on official business and 
may not be used for personal use or for travel to or from an employee's 
place of residence, unless specifically authorized or assigned by the 
supervisor.
    (c) An employee may not use FTS to make personal phone calls at 
Government expense.
    (d) An employee may not use Government purchase authority for 
personal acquisitions even though reimbursement is made.


<R05>
Sec. 700.533  Restrictions affecting travel and travel expense reimbursement.

    (a) When an employee is on officially authorized travel his or her 
expenses are reimbursed by the Government. The employee may not request 
nor accept reimbursement in cash or kind for travel expenses from any 
other source, even when the employee's expenses exceed the maximum 
Government allowance.
    (b) An employee who is authorized to attend a convention, seminar, 
or similar meeting while on official duty, whose travel is being paid by 
the sponsoring association, may not also claim travel expenses from the 
Government.
    (c) An employee may accept accommodations and expense reimbursement 
for attending meetings, functions, etc. in his or her private capacity 
and on his or her own time, provided that such acceptance does not 
produce an actual or apparent conflict of interest. This restriction 
prohibits an employee from accepting accommodations or reimbursement 
from anyone having or seeking business with the Commission.
    (d) Commission employees traveling on official business, as well as 
employees traveling on personal business, may not accept the use of 
private airplanes, cars, or other means of transportation offered at no 
expense by individuals conducting or seeking business dealings with the 
Commission, nor from clients of the Commission.

    Exception: An employee may accept transportation and meals of modest 
value provided by a contractor or client in connection with official 
business when it is not practical to make arrangements for Government or 
commercial accommodations. The employee must receive prior approval of 
the supervisor in such case. This might occur, for example, if an 
employee were traveling to a remote area where no Government vehicle 
were available, or where there are no nearby restaurants or eating 
places. There is no prohibition against a contractor or private citizen 
traveling as a passenger in a Government vehicle driven by a Commission 
employee on official business, provided administrative procedures have 
been followed in making the travel arrangements.


<R05>
Sec. 700.535  Nepotism.

    An employee may not appoint or advocate the appointment to any 
position under his or her control, any individual

[[Page 793]]

who is a relative of the employee. No employee shall supervise a member 
of his or her own family except in emergency situations.


<R05>
Sec. 700.537  Indebtedness.

    (a) Commission personnel shall pay their just financial obligations 
in a timely manner, especially those imposed by law, such as Federal, 
state, or local taxes. For the purposes of this paragraph, ``just 
financial obligation'' means one acknowledged by the employee or reduced 
to judgment by a court.
    (b) Employees shall promptly refund any salary overpayments and 
excess travel advances.
    (c) An employee's debts to private creditors are his or her personal 
concern. Any complaints or questions concerning such obligations will be 
referred to the employee for handling. Creditors and collectors shall 
not have access to employees on Agency premises during duty hours.


<R05>
Sec. 700.539  Soliciting contributions.

    (a) An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another 
employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift 
to an official superior or accept a gift from an employee receiving less 
pay than himself or herself. (5 U.S.C. 7351) However, this paragraph 
does not preclude a voluntary gift of nominal value made on a special 
occasion.
    (b) If authorized by the supervisor, an employee may solicit 
contributions for charitable causes. He or she may also be permitted to 
collect small donations for gifts for fellow employees for special 
occasions during slack moments.


<R05>
Sec. 700.541  Fraud or false statement in a Government matter.

    ``Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department 
or agency of the United States, knowingly or wilfully falsifies, 
conceals or covers up by a trick, scheme or device a material fact, or 
makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain 
false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not 
more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both (18 U.S.C.

removal (5 U.S.C. 7352). The Relocation Commission recognizes alcoholism 
and drug abuse as serious and treatable illnesses. Excessive absence and 
poor work performance are two of the specific problems resulting from 
excessive use of alcohol and drugs. The Commission management will 
assist any employee who has such a problem to obtain professional help 
and will make reasonable allowance as permitted by work schedules to 
allow an employee approved leave for professional treatment. Anyone who 
seeks such assistance will be guaranteed confidential handling of his or 
her case. Disciplinary action will be considered if an employee rejects 
or ignores treatment or other appropriate assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 700.547  Consuming intoxicants on Government premises or during duty hours.

    Consuming alcohol or non-prescription drugs on agency premises, or 
while driving or riding in a Government vehicle, or during working hours 
are prohibited conduct and employees violating this regulation are 
subject to disciplinary acton, including discharge.


<R05>
Sec. 700.549  Employee organizations.

    An employee may not knowingly be a member of an organization of 
Government employees that advocates the overthrow of the United States' 
constitutional form of government (5 U.S.C. 7311). Employees are also 
prohibited from striking against the Federal Government. With these 
restrictions, an employee has the right to form, join, or assist lawful 
employee organizations. Similarly, an employee has

[[Page 794]]

also the right to refrain from such activity. In either case, the 
employee may exercise his or her right freely and without fear of 
penalty or reprisal and shall be protected in the exercise of such 
rights.


<R05>
Sec. 700.551  Franking privilege and official stationery.

    An employee is strictly prohibited from using Government franked 
envelopes with or without applied postage, or official letterhead 
stationery for personal business. (18 U.S.C. 1719)


<R05>
Sec. 700.553  Use of official titles.

    Employees are prohibited from using their official titles in 
conducting private business or participation in private or public group 
activities not concerned with official duties. Use is strictly limited 
to those occasions and circumstances where representation is official.


<R05>
Sec. 700.555  Notary services.

    An employee may not charge a fee for performing notarial services as 
part of his or her job duties (EO 977 Nov. 24, 1908).


<R05>
Sec. 700.557  Political activity.

    (a) Regulations on the political activity of Federal employees can 
be found in 5 U.S.C. 73. In general, the law and the rules prohibit 
using official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering 
with an election or affecting its results, and taking an active part in 
partisan political management or partisan political campaigns.
    (b) Special Government employees of the Commission are subject to 
the political activity restrictions contained in 5 U.S.C. 73 and 18 
U.S.C. 602, 603, 607 and 608 while on an active duty status only.
    (c) Pursuant to provisions of the regulations cited, employees may 
take part in certain local elections. However, Commission employees are 
restricted from taking an active role in political elections of the 
Navajo and Hopi tribal governments, even though such elections are not 
partisan in the usual meaning of the word. With respect to tribal 
elections, employees may not:
    (1) Run for tribal elective office.
    (2) Organize, direct, nor actively participate in a tribal electoral 
campaign.
    (3) Solicit or attempt to coerce fellow employees to contribute 
anything of value to an individual or group engaged in tribal political 
activity.
    (4) Circulate petitions, posters, or other political materials 
during working hours or on Commission premises.
    (5) Engage in any other type of tribal political activity which 
produces a conflict of interest between the employee's job 
responsibilities and the political activity.


<R05>
Sec. 700.559  Equal opportunity.

    Commission personnel shall scrupulously adhere to the Commission 
program of equal opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, sex, 
age, handicap, or national origin.


<R05>
Sec. 700.561  Sexual harassment.

    (a) Sexual harassment is a form of employee misconduct which 
undermines the integrity of the employment relationship. All employees 
must be allowed to work in an environment free from unsolicited and 
unwelcome sexual overtures. Sexual harassment is defined by the Office 
of Personnel Management as ``deliberate or repeated unsolicited verbal 
comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature which are 
unwelcome.'' Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments. 
It refers to behavior which is not welcome, which is personally 
offensive and debilitates morale, interfering with the work 
effectiveness of its victims and their co-workers.
    (b) Sexual harassment is a prohibited personnel practice when it 
results in discrimination for or against an employee on the basis of 
conduct not related to performance.

For example:
    --If submission to sexual advances is a condition of employment, 
whether expressed in explicit or implicit terms;
    --If employment decisions, such as promotion, training, salary 
increases, rewards, etc., are based on an employee's submission to or 
rejection of sexual advances;
    --If the sexual conduct substantially interferes with an affected 
person's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile or 
offensive work environment.


[[Page 795]]


    (c) Within the Federal Government, a supervisor who uses implicit or 
explicit coercive sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the 
career, salary or job of an employee is engaging in sexual harassment. 
Similarly, an employee of an agency who behaves in this manner in the 
process of conducting agency business is engaging in sexual harassment. 
Finally, any employee who participates in deliberate or repeated 
unsolicited verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual 
nature which are unwelcome and interfere with work productivity is also 
engaging in sexual harassment.
    (d) It is the policy of the Relocation Commission that sexual 
harassment is unacceptable conduct in the workplace and will not be 
condoned. An employee who believes that he or she is subject to sexual 
harassment may contact one or more of the following people within the 
Commission for assistance:
    (1) The immediate supervisor or second level supervisor.
    (2) The EEO Counselor.
    (3) The agency EEO Officer.
    (4) The EEO Counselor at the Agency Liaison Division of the General 
Services Administration.

of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or 
removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological

permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions 
until expiration.
    (5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 
8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit

procedures of Sec. 700.811. However, the Federal Land Manager shall 
insure that provisions of Secs. 700.815 and 700.817 have been met by 
other documented means and that any official duties which might result 
in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural 
site, as determined by the Federal Land Manager, have been the subject 
of consideration under Sec. 700.813.
    (d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf 
of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal Land Manager

scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal Land 
Manager.
    (e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities 
governing the use of the New Lands and Indian lands, authorizations may 
be required for activities which do not require a permit under this 
part. Any person wishing to conduct on the New Lands or Indian lands any 
activity related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this part 
should consult with the Federal Land Manager, for the purpose of 
determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning 
such activities.

    (a) Suspension or revocation for cause. (1) The Federal Land Manager

<R05>
Sec. 700.821  Appeals relating to permits.

<R05>
Sec. 700.823  Relationship to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

    Issuance of a permit in accordance with the Act and this part does 
not constitute an undertaking requiring compliance with Section 106 of 
the Act of October 15, 1996 (16 U.S.C. 470f). However, the mere issuance 
of such a permit does not excuse the Federal Land Manager from 
compliance with section 106 where otherwise required.


<R05>
Sec. 700.825  Custody of archaeological resources.

    (a) Archaeological resources excavated or removed from public lands 
remain the property of the Navajo Nation.

ownership over such resources.


<R05>
Sec. 700.827  Determination of archaeological or commercial value and cost of restoration and repair.

    (a) Archaeolgical value. For purposes of this part, the 
archaeological value of any archaeological resource involved in a 
violation of the prohibitions in Sec. 700.807 of this part or conditions 
of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be the value of the 
information associated with the archaeological resource. This value 
shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the 
scientific information which would have been obtained prior to the 
violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost 
of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out 
laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to 
realize the information potential.
    (b) Commercial value. For purposes of this part, the commercial 
value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the 
prohibitions in Sec. 700.807 of this part or conditions of a permit 
issued pursuant to this part shall be for its fair market value. Where 
the violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the 
fair market value should be determined using the condition of the 
archaeological resource prior to the violation to the extent that its 
prior condition can be ascertained.
    (c) Cost of restoration and repair. For purposes of this part, the 
cost of restoration and repair of archaeological resources damages as a 
result of a violation or prohibitions or conditions pursuant to this 
part, shall be the sum of the costs already incurred for emergency 
restoration or repair work, plus those costs projected to be necessary 
to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be 
limited to, the costs of the following.
    (1) Reconstruction of the archaeological resource;
    (2) Stabilization of the archaeological resource;
    (3) Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization;
    (4) Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization;
    (5) Physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by 
the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from 
further disturbance;
    (6) Examination and analysis of the archaeological resource 
including recording remaining archaeological information, where 
necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining values which 
cannot be otherwise conserved;
    (7) Reinterment of human remains in accordance with religious custom 
and

[[Page 810]]

State, local, or tribal law, where appropriate, as determined by the 
Federal Land Manager.
    (8) Preparation of reports relating to any of the above activities.

a notice of violation, and no penalty shall be assessed.
    (4) Where the facts warrant a conclusion that a violation has 
occurred, the Federal Land Manager shall determine a penalty amount in 
accordance with Sec. 700.831.
    (f) Notice of assessment. The Federal Land Manager shall notify the

in the notice of assessment, personally or by registered or certified 
mail (return receipt requested).

    (3) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be held in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554. In any such hearing, the amount of civil 
penalty assessed shall be determined in accordance with this part, and 
shall not be limited by the amount assessed by the Federal Land Manager 
under paragraph (f) of this section or any offer of mitigation or 
remission made by the Federal Land Manager.
    (h) Final administrative decision. (1) Where the person served with 
a notice of violation has accepted the penalty pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section, the notice of violation shall constitute the 
final administrative decision;
    (2) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has not 
filed a timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section, the notice of assessment shall constitute the final 
administrative decision;
    (3) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has filed a 
timely request for hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, 
the decision resulting from the hearing or any applicable administrative 
appeal therefrom shall constitute the final administrative decision.
    (i) Payment of penalty. (1) The person assessed a civil penalty 
shall have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final 
administrative decision in which to make full payment assessed, unless a 
timely request for appeal has been filed with a U.S. District Court, as 
provided in section 7(b)(1) of the Act.

assessed a civil penalty is found, resides, or transacts business. Where 
the Federal Land Manager is not represented by the Attorney General, a 
civil action may be initiated directly by the Federal Land Manager.
    (j) Other remedies not waived. Assessment of a penalty under this

<R05>
Sec. 700.839  Permitting procedures for Navajo Nation lands.

    (a) If the lands involved in a permit application are Indian lands, 
the consent of the appropriate Indian tribal authority or individual 
Indian landowner is required by the Act and the regulations in this 
subpart.
    (b) When Indian tribal lands are involved in an application for a 
permit or a request for extension or modification of a permit, the 
consent of the Indian tribal government must be obtained. For Indian 
allotted lands outside reservation boundaries, consent from only the 
individual landowner is needed. When multiple-owner allotted lands are 
involved, consent by more than 50 percent of the ownership interest is 
sufficient. For Indian allotted lands within reservation boundaries, 
consent must be obtained from the Indian tribal government and the 
individual landowner(s).
    (c) The applicant should consult with the Office concerning 
procedures for obtaining consent from the appropriate Indian tribal 
authorities and submit the permit application to the Office that is 
responsible for the administration of the lands in question. The Office 
shall ensure that consultation with the appropriate Indian tribal 
authority or individual Indian landowner regarding terms and conditions 
of the permit occurs prior to detailed evaluation of the application. 
The Indian tribal authority or individual Indian landowner shall have 30 
days from the date of receipt of the consultation request from the 
Office to respond to such request. Failure of the Indian tribal 
authority or individual Indian landowner to respond timely to the 
consultation request shall be deemed to be consent to the request. 
Permits shall include terms and conditions requested by the Indian tribe 
or Indian landowner pursuant to Sec. 700.817 of this part.
    (d) The issuance of a permit under this part does not remove the 
requirement for any other permit required by Indian tribal law.

[[Page 816]]

reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to

requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified 
entities that subject qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on 
the basis of handicap. However, the programs or activities of entities 
that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, 
covered by this part.

established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.
Secs. 720.141--720.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 720.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 720.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 720.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the

[[Page 817]]

program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible 
to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 720.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not 
required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other 
methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The 
agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 720.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. 
In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not 
required because of Sec. 720.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of 
achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and

[[Page 818]]

written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.
    (e) Housing. The agency shall ensure that any dwelling purchased for 
a relocatee household is readily accessible to and usable by any 
handicapped person who is a member of that household.

1986]


<R05>
Sec. 720.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    (a) Each building or part of a building that is constructed or 
altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be 
designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and 
usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and 
standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as 
established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings 
covered by this section.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that any dwelling that is constructed 
for a relocatee household is designed and constructed so as to be 
readily accessible to and usable by any handicapped person who is a 
member of that household.

Secs. 720.152--720.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 720.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 720.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If

[[Page 819]]

an action required to comply with this section would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped 
persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
Secs. 720.161--720.169  [Reserved]


<R05>

section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs or activities conducted by the agency.

section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures

entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily

the guidance of the Negotiated Rulemaking procedures required by section 
107 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.


<R05>
Sec. 900.2   Purpose and scope.

    (a) General. These regulations codify uniform and consistent rules 
for contracts by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and 
the Department of the Interior (DOI) in implementing title I of the

under this part are programs administered (under current or future law 
or interagency agreement) by the DHHS and the DOI for the benefit of 
Indians for which appropriations are made to other Federal agencies.
    (c) This part included in contracts by reference. Each contract, 
including grants and cooperative agreements in lieu of contracts awarded 
under section 9 of the Act, shall include by reference the provisions of 
this part, and any amendment thereto, and they are binding on the 
Secretary and the contractor except as otherwise specifically authorized 
by a waiver under section 107(e) of the Act.
    (d) Freedom of Information. Access to records maintained by the 
Secretary is governed by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552)

of tribal records that the Secretary demonstrates are clearly required 
to be maintained as part of the record keeping systems of the DHHS or

requirements in part 900 under assigned control number 1076-0136. The 
information for part 900 is being collected and used by the Departments

to render such programs and services more responsive to the needs and 
desires of those communities.
    (2) Congress has declared its commitment to the maintenance of the 
Federal Government's unique and continuing relationship with, and 
responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as 
a whole through

[[Page 830]]

the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which 
will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of 
programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful 
participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and 
administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this 
policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting 
Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal 
governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing 
the economies of their respective communities.
    (3) Congress has declared that a major national goal of the United 
States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services 
and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel 
in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-
determination essential to their social and economic well-being.
    (4) Congress has declared that the programs, functions, services, or 
activities that are contracted and funded under this Act shall include 
administrative functions of the Department of the Interior and the 
Department of Health and Human Services (whichever is applicable) that 
support the delivery of services to Indians, including those 
administrative activities supportive of, but not included as part of, 
the service delivery programs described in this paragraph that are 
otherwise contractible. The administrative functions referred to in the 
preceding sentence shall be contractible without regard to the 
organizational level within the Department that carries out such 
functions. Contracting of the administrative functions described herein 
shall not be construed to limit or reduce in any way the funding for any 
program, function, service, or activity serving any other tribe under 
the Act or any other law. The Secretary is not required to reduce 
funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make 
funds available to another Indian tribe or tribal organization under 
this Act.
    (5) Congress has further declared that each provision of the Act and 
each provision of contracts entered into thereunder shall be liberally 
construed for the benefit of the tribes or tribal organizations to 
transfer the funding and the related functions, services, activities, 
and programs (or portions thereof), that are otherwise contractible 
under the Act, including all related administrative functions, from the 
Federal government to the contractor.
    (6) Congress has declared that one of the primary goals of the 1994 
amendments to the Act was to minimize the reporting requirements 
applicable to tribal contractors and to eliminate excessive and 
burdensome reporting requirements. Reporting requirements over and above 
the annual audit report are to be negotiated with disagreements subject 
to the declination procedures of section 102 of the Act.
    (7) Congress has declared that there not be any threshold issues 
which would avoid the declination, contract review, approval, and appeal 
process.
    (8) Congress has declared that all self-determination contract 
proposals must be supported by the resolution of an Indian tribe(s).
    (9) Congress has declared that to the extent that programs, 
functions, services, and activities carried out by tribes and tribal 
organizations pursuant to contracts entered into under this Act reduce 
the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with 
respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that 
have not otherwise been included in the amount of contract funds 
determined under Section 106(a) of the Act, the Secretary shall make 
such savings available for the provision of additional services to 
program beneficiaries, either directly or through contractors, in a 
manner equitable to both direct and contracted programs.
    (b) Secretarial policy. (1) It is the policy of the Secretary to 
facilitate the efforts of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to 
plan, conduct and administer programs, functions, services and 
activities, or portions thereof, which the Departments are authorized to 
administer for the benefit of Indians because of their status as 
Indians. The Secretary shall make best efforts to remove any obstacles 
which might hinder Indian tribes and tribal organizations including 
obstacles that hinder tribal

[[Page 831]]

autonomy and flexibility in the administration of such programs.
    (2) It is the policy of the Secretary to encourage Indian tribes and 
tribal organizations to become increasingly knowledgeable about the 
Departments' programs administered for the benefit of Indians by 
providing information on such programs, functions and activities and the 
opportunities Indian tribes have regarding them.
    (3) It is the policy of the Secretary to provide a uniform and 
consistent set of rules for contracts under the Act. The rules contained 
herein are designed to facilitate and encourage Indian tribes to 
participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those 
Federal programs serving Indian people. The Secretary shall afford 
Indian tribes and tribal organizations the flexibility, information, and 
discretion necessary to design contractible programs to meet the needs 
of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, 
geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious and 
institutional needs.
    (4) The Secretary recognizes that contracting under the Act is an 
exercise by Indian tribes of the government-to-government relationship 
between the United States and the Indian tribes. When an Indian tribe 
contracts, there is a transfer of the responsibility with the associated 
funding. The tribal contractor is accountable for managing the day-to-
day operations of the contracted Federal programs, functions, services, 
and activities. The contracting tribe thereby accepts the responsibility 
and accountability to the beneficiaries under the contract with respect 
to use of the funds and the satisfactory performance of the programs, 
functions, services and activities funded under the contract. The 
Secretary will continue to discharge the trust responsibilities to 
protect and conserve the trust resources of Indian tribes and the trust 
resources of individual Indians.
    (5) The Secretary recognizes that tribal decisions to contract or 
not to contract are equal expressions of self-determination.
    (6) The Secretary shall maintain consultation with tribal 
governments and tribal organizations in the Secretary's budget process 
relating to programs, functions, services and activities subject to the 
Act. In addition, on an annual basis, the Secretary shall consult with, 
and solicit the participation of, Indian tribes and tribal organizations 
in the development of the budget for the Indian Health Service and the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (including participation of Indian tribes and 
tribal organizations in formulating annual budget requests that the 
Secretary submits to the President for submission to Congress pursuant 
to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code).
    (7) The Secretary is committed to implementing and fully supporting 
the policy of Indian self-determination by recognizing and supporting 
the many positive and successful efforts and directions of tribal 
governments and extending the applicability of this policy to all 
operational components within the Department. By fully extending Indian 
self-determination contracting to all operational components within the 
Department having programs or portions of programs for the benefit of 
Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through (D) and for the benefit of 
Indians because of their status as Indians under section 102(a)(1)(E), 
it is the Secretary's intent to support and assist Indian tribes in the 
development of strong and stable tribal governments capable of 
administering quality programs that meet the tribally determined needs 
and directions of their respective communities. It is also the policy of 
the Secretary to have all other operational components within the 
Department work cooperatively with tribal governments on a government-
to-government basis so as to expedite the transition away from Federal 
domination of Indian programs and make the ideals of Indian self-
government and self-determination a reality.
    (8) It is the policy of the Secretary that the contractibility of 
programs under this Act should be encouraged. In this regard, Federal 
laws and regulations should be interpreted in a manner that will 
facilitate the inclusion of those programs or portions of those programs 
that are for the benefit of Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through 
(D) of the Act, and that are for

[[Page 832]]

the benefit of Indians because of their status of Indians under section 
102(a)(1)(E) of the Act.
    (9) It is the Secretary's policy that no later than upon receipt of 
a contract proposal under the Act (or written notice of an Indian tribe 
or tribal organization's intention to contract), the Secretary shall 
commence planning such administrative actions, including but not limited 
to transfers or reductions in force, transfers of property, and 
transfers of contractible functions, as may be necessary to ensure a 
timely transfer of responsibilities and funding to Indian tribes and 
tribal organizations.
    (10) It is the policy of the Secretary to make available to Indian 
tribes and tribal organizations all administrative functions that may 
lawfully be contracted under the Act, employing methodologies consistent 
with the methodology employed with respect to such functions under 
titles III and IV of the Act.
    (11) The Secretary's commitment to Indian self-determination 
requires that these regulations be liberally construed for the benefit 
of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to effectuate the strong 
Federal policy of self-determination and, further, that any ambiguities 
herein be construed in favor of the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
so as to facilitate and enable the transfer of services, programs, 
functions, and activities, or portions thereof, authorized by the Act.

<R05>

    The Secretary may only decline to approve a proposal for one of five 
specific reasons:
    (a) The service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the 
particular program or function to be contracted will not be 
satisfactory;
    (b) Adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;
    (c) The proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be 
properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;
    (d) The amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of 
the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under 
section 106(a) of the Act; or
    (e) The program, function, service, or activity (or a portion 
thereof) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond

[[Page 837]]

the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities covered under 
section 102(a)(1) of the Act because the proposal includes activities 
that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.


<R05>
Sec. 900.23  Can the Secretary decline a proposal where the Secretary's objection can be overcome through the contract?

    No. The Secretary may not decline to enter into a contract with an 
Indian tribe or tribal organization based on any objection that will be 
overcome through the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 900.24  Can a contract proposal for an Indian tribe or tribal organization's share of administrative programs, functions, services, and activities be 
          declined for any reason other than the five reasons specified 
          in Sec. 900.22?

    No. The Secretary may only decline a proposal based upon one or more 
of the five reasons listed above. If a contract affects the preexisting 
level of services to any other tribe, the Secretary shall address that 
effect in the Secretary's annual report to Congress under section 
106(c)(6) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 900.25  What if only a portion of a proposal raises one of the five declination criteria?

    The Secretary must approve any severable portion of a proposal that 
does not support a declination finding described in Sec. 900.20, subject 
to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization approve.


<R05>

Sec. 900.26  What happens if the Secretary declines a part of a proposal on the ground that the proposal proposes in part to plan, conduct, or administer a 
          program, function, service or activity that is beyond the 
          scope of programs covered under section 102(a) of the Act, or 
          proposes a level of funding that is in excess of the 
          applicable level determined under section 106(a) of the Act?

    In those situations the Secretary is required, as appropriate, to 
approve the portion of the program, function, service, or activity that 
is authorized under section 102(a) of the Act, or approve a level of 
funding that is authorized under section 106(a) of the Act. As noted in 
Sec. 900.25, the approval is subject to any alteration in the scope of 
the proposal that the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization approve.


<R05>

Sec. 900.27  If an Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to contract for a severable portion of a proposal, does the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
          lose its appeal rights to challenge the portion of the 
          proposal that was declined?

    No, but the hearing and appeal procedures contained in these 
regulations only apply to the portion of the proposal that was declined.


<R05>

Sec. 900.28  Is technical assistance available to an Indian tribe or tribal organization to avoid declination of a proposal?

    Yes. In accordance with section 103(d) of the Act, upon receiving a 
proposal, the Secretary shall provide any necessary requested technical 
assistance to an Indian tribe or tribal organization, and shall share 
all relevant information with the Indian tribe or tribal organization, 
in order to avoid declination of the proposal.


<R05>

Sec. 900.29  What is the Secretary required to do if the Secretary decides to decline all or a portion of a proposal?

    If the Secretary decides to decline all or a severable portion of a 
proposal, the Secretary is required:
    (a) To advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization in writing of 
the Secretary's objections, including a specific finding that clearly 
demonstrates that (or that is supported by a controlling legal authority 
that) one of the conditions set forth in Sec. 900.22 exists, together 
with a detailed explanation of the reason for the decision to decline 
the proposal and, within 20 days, any documents relied on in making the 
decision; and
    (b) To advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization in writing of 
the rights described in Sec. 900.31.

[[Page 838]]


<R05>

Sec. 900.30  When the Secretary declines all or a portion of a proposal, is the Secretary required to provide an Indian tribe or tribal organization with 
          technical assistance?

    Yes. The Secretary shall provide additional technical assistance to 
overcome the stated objections, in accordance with section 102(b) of the 
Act, and shall provide any necessary requested technical assistance to 
develop any modifications to overcome the Secretary's stated objections.


<R05>

Sec. 900.31  When the Secretary declines all or a portion of a proposal, is an Indian tribe or tribal organization entitled to any appeal?

    Yes. The Indian tribe or tribal organization is entitled to an 
appeal on the objections raised by the Secretary, with an agency hearing 
on the record, and the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any 
issue raised in the matter. The procedures for appeals are in subpart L 
of these regulations. Alternatively, at its option the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization has the right to sue in Federal district court to 
challenge the Secretary's decision.


<R05>

Sec. 900.32  Can the Secretary decline an Indian tribe or tribal organization's proposed successor annual funding agreement?

    No. If it is substantially the same as the prior annual funding 
agreement (except for funding increases included in appropriations acts 
or funding reductions as provided in section 106(b) of the Act) and the 
contract is with DHHS or the BIA, the Secretary shall approve and add to 
the contract the full amount of funds to which the contractor is 
entitled, and may not decline, any portion of a successor annual funding 
agreement. Any portion of an annual funding agreement proposal which is 
not substantially the same as that which was funded previously (e.g., a 
redesign proposal; waiver proposal; different proposed funding amount; 
or different program, service, function, or activity), or any annual 
funding agreement proposal which pertains to a contract with an agency 
of DOI other than the BIA, is subject to the declination criteria and 
procedures in subpart E. If there is a disagreement over the 
availability of appropriations, the Secretary may decline the proposal 
in part under the procedure in subpart E.


<R05>

Sec. 900.33  Are all proposals to renew term contracts subject to the declination criteria?

    Department of Health and Human Services and the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs will not review the renewal of a term contract for declination 
issues where no material and substantial change to the scope or funding 
of a program, functions, services, or activities has been proposed by 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Proposals to renew term 
contracts with DOI agencies other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs may 
be reviewed under the declination criteria.

   Subpart F--Standards for Tribal or Tribal Organization Management 
                                 Systems

                                 General


<R05>

Sec. 900.35  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart contains the minimum standards for the management 
systems used by Indian tribes or tribal organizations when carrying out 
self-determination contracts. It provides standards for an Indian tribe 
or tribal organization's financial management system, procurement 
management system, and property management system.


<R05>

Sec. 900.36  What requirements are imposed upon Indian tribes or tribal organizations by this subpart?

    When carrying out self-determination contracts, Indian tribes and 
tribal organizations shall develop, implement, and maintain systems that 
meet these minimum standards, unless one or more of the standards have 
been waived, in whole or in part, under section 107(e) of the Act and 
subpart K.


<R05>

Sec. 900.37  What provisions of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars or the ``common rule'' apply to self-determination contracts?

    The only provisions of OMB Circulars and the only provisions of the 
``common rule'' that apply to self-determination contracts are the 
provisions

[[Page 839]]

adopted in these regulations, those expressly required or modified by 
the Act, and those negotiated and agreed to in a self-determination 
contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.38  Do these standards apply to the subcontractors of an Indian tribe or tribal organization carrying out a self-determination contract?

    An Indian tribe or tribal organization may require that some or all 
of the standards in this subpart be imposed upon its subcontractors when 
carrying out a self-determination contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.39  What is the difference between a standard and a system?

    (a) Standards are the minimum baseline requirements for the 
performance of an activity. Standards establish the ``what'' that an 
activity should accomplish.
    (b) Systems are the procedural mechanisms and processes for the day-
to-day conduct of an activity. Systems are ``how'' the activity will be 
accomplished.


<R05>

Sec. 900.40  When are Indian tribe or tribal organization management standards and management systems evaluated?

    (a) Management standards are evaluated by the Secretary when the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization submits an initial contract 
proposal.
    (b) Management systems are evaluated by an independent auditor 
through the annual single agency audit report that is required by the 
Act and OMB Circular A-128.


<R05>

Sec. 900.41  How long must an Indian tribe or tribal organization keep management system records?

    The Indian tribe or tribal organization must retain financial, 
procurement and property records for the minimum periods described 
below. Electronic, magnetic or photographic records may be substituted 
for hard copies.
    (a) Financial records. Financial records include documentation of 
supporting costs incurred under the contract. These records must be 
retained for three years from the date of submission of the single audit 
report to the Secretary.
    (b) Procurement records. Procurement records include solicitations, 
purchase orders, contracts, payment histories and records applicable of 
significant decisions. These records must be retained for three years 
after the Indian tribe or tribal organization or subcontractors make 
final payment and all other pending matters are closed.
    (c) Property management records. Property management records of real 
and personal property transactions must be retained for three years from 
the date of disposition, replacement, or transfer.
    (d) Litigation, audit exceptions and claims. Records pertaining to 
any litigation, audit exceptions or claims requiring management systems 
data must be retained until the action has been completed.

               Standards for Financial Management Systems


<R05>

Sec. 900.42  What are the general financial management system standards that apply to an Indian tribe carrying out a self-determination contract?

    An Indian tribe shall expend and account for contract funds in 
accordance with all applicable tribal laws, regulations, and procedures.


<R05>

Sec. 900.43  What are the general financial management system standards that apply to a tribal organization carrying out a self-determination contract?

    A tribal organization shall expend and account for contract funds in 
accordance with the procedures of the tribal organization.


<R05>

Sec. 900.44  What minimum general standards apply to all Indian tribe or tribal organization financial management systems when carrying out a self-determination 
          contract?

    The fiscal control and accounting procedures of an Indian tribe or 
tribal organization shall be sufficient to:
    (a) Permit preparation of reports required by a self-determination 
contract and the Act; and
    (b) Permit the tracing of contract funds to a level of expenditure 
adequate to establish that they have not been used in violation of any 
restrictions or prohibitions contained in any

[[Page 840]]

statute that applies to the self-determination contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.45  What specific minimum requirements shall an Indian tribe or tribal organization's financial management system contain to meet these standards?

    An Indian tribe or tribal organization's financial management system 
shall include provisions for the following seven elements.
    (a) Financial reports. The financial management system shall provide 
for accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results 
of self-determination contract activities. This includes providing the 
Secretary a completed Financial Status Report, SF 269A, as negotiated 
and agreed to in the self-determination contract.
    (b) Accounting records. The financial management system shall 
maintain records sufficiently detailed to identify the source and 
application of self-determination contract funds received by the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization. The system shall contain sufficient 
information to identify contract awards, obligations and unobligated 
balances, assets, liabilities, outlays, or expenditures and income.
    (c) Internal controls. The financial management system shall 
maintain effective control and accountability for all self-determination 
contract funds received and for all Federal real property, personal 
property, and other assets furnished for use by the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization under the self-determination contract.
    (d) Budget controls. The financial management system shall permit 
the comparison of actual expenditures or outlays with the amounts 
budgeted by the Indian tribe or tribal organization for each self-
determination contract.
    (e) Allowable costs. The financial management system shall be 
sufficient to determine the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of self-determination contract costs based upon the terms 
of the self-determination contract and the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization's applicable OMB cost principles, as amended by the Act and 
these regulations. (The following chart lists certain OMB Circulars and 
suggests the entities that may use each, but the final selection of the 
applicable circular may differ from those shown, as agreed to by the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary. Agreements 
between an Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary 
currently in place do not require renegotiation.) Copies of these 
circulars are available from the Executive Office of the President, 
Publications Service, 725 17th Street N. W., Washington, D. C. 20503.

    (f) Source documentation. The financial management system shall 
contain accounting records that are supported by source documentation, 
e.g., canceled checks, paid bills, payroll records, time and attendance 
records, contract award documents, purchase orders, and other primary 
records that support self-determination contract fund expenditures.
    (g) Cash management. The financial management system shall provide 
for accurate, current, and complete disclosure of cash revenues 
disbursements, cash-on-hand balances, and obligations by source and 
application for each Indian tribe or tribal organization, and 
subcontractor if applicable, so that complete and accurate cash 
transactions may be prepared as required by the self-determination 
contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.46   What requirements are imposed upon the Secretary for financial management by these standards?

    The Secretary shall establish procedures, consistent with Treasury 
regulations as modified by the Act, for the transfer of funds from the 
United States to the Indian tribe or tribal organization in strict 
compliance with the self-determination contract and the annual funding 
agreement.

                 Procurement Management System Standards


<R05>

Sec. 900.47   When procuring property or services with self-determination contract funds, can an Indian tribe or tribal organization follow the same procurement 
          policies and procedures applicable to other Indian tribe or 
          tribal organization funds?

    Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall have standards that 
conform to the standards in this subpart. If the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization relies upon standards different than those described below, 
it shall identify the standards it will use as a proposed waiver in the 
initial contract proposal or as a waiver request to an existing 
contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.48   If the Indian tribe or tribal organization does not propose different standards, what basic standards shall the Indian tribe or tribal 
          organization follow?

    (a) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall ensure that its 
vendors and/or subcontractors perform in accordance with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.
    (b) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall maintain written 
standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees who 
award and administer contracts.
    (1) No employee, officer, elected official, or agent of the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization shall participate in the selection, award, 
or administration of a procurement supported by Federal funds if a 
conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved.
    (2) An employee, officer, elected official, or agent of an Indian 
tribe or tribal organization, or of a subcontractor of the Indian tribe 
or tribal organization, is not allowed to solicit or accept gratuities, 
favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential 
contractors, or parties to sub-agreements, with the following 
exemptions. The Indian tribe or tribal organization may exempt a 
financial interest that is not substantial or a gift that is an 
unsolicited item of nominal value.
    (3) These standards shall also provide for penalties, sanctions, or 
other disciplinary actions for violations of the standards.
    (c) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall review proposed 
procurements to avoid buying unnecessary or duplicative items and ensure 
the reasonableness of the price. The Indian tribe or tribal organization 
should consider consolidating or breaking out procurement to obtain more 
economical purchases. Where appropriate, the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization shall compare leasing and purchasing alternatives to 
determine which is more economical.
    (d) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall conduct all major 
procurement transactions by providing full and open competition, to the 
extent

[[Page 843]]

necessary to assure efficient expenditure of contract funds and to the 
extent feasible in the local area.
    (1) Indian tribes or tribal organizations shall develop their own 
definition for ``major procurement transactions.''
    (2) As provided in sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Act, Indian 
preference and tribal preferences shall be applied in any procurement 
award.
    (e) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall make procurement 
awards only to responsible entities who have the ability to perform 
successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. 
In making this judgment, the Indian tribe or tribal organization will 
consider such matters as the contractor's integrity, its compliance with 
public policy, its record of past performance, and its financial and 
technical resources.
    (f) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall maintain records 
on the significant history of all major procurement transactions. These 
records may include, but are not limited to, the rationale for the 
method of procurement, the selection of contract type, the contract 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (g) The Indian tribe or tribal organization is solely responsible, 
using good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for 
processing and settling all contractual and administrative issues 
arising out of a procurement. These issues include, but are not limited 
to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims.
    (1) The settlement of any protest, dispute, or claim shall not 
relieve the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any obligations under 
a self-determination contract.
    (2) Violations of law shall be referred to the tribal or Federal 
authority having proper jurisdiction.


<R05>

Sec. 900.49   What procurement standards apply to subcontracts?

    Each subcontract entered into under the Act shall at a minimum:
    (a) Be in writing;
    (b) Identify the interested parties, their authorities, and the 
purposes of the contract;
    (c) State the work to be performed under the contract;
    (d) State the process for making any claim, the payments to be made, 
and the terms of the contract, which shall be fixed; and
    (e) Be subject to sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Act.


<R05>

Sec. 900.50   What Federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders apply to subcontractors?

    Certain provisions of the Act as well as other applicable Federal 
laws, regulations, and Executive Orders apply to subcontracts awarded 
under self-determination contracts. As a result, subcontracts should 
contain a provision informing the recipient that their award is funded 
with Indian Self-Determination Act funds and that the recipient is 
responsible for identifying and ensuring compliance with applicable 
Federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. The Secretary and the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization may, through negotiation, identify 
all or a portion of such requirements in the self-determination contract 
and, if so identified, these requirements should be identified in 
subcontracts.

                  Property Management System Standards


<R05>

Sec. 900.51   What is an Indian tribe or tribal organization's property management system expected to do?

    An Indian tribe or tribal organization's property management system 
shall account for all property furnished or transferred by the Secretary 
for use under a self-determination contract or acquired with contract 
funds. The property management system shall contain requirements for the 
use, care, maintenance, and disposition of Federally-owned and other 
property as follows:
    (a) Where title vests in the Indian tribe, in accordance with tribal 
law and procedures; or
    (b) In the case of a tribal organization, according to the internal 
property procedures of the tribal organization.

[[Page 844]]

    The property management system of the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization shall track:
    (a) Personal property with an acquisition value in excess of $5,000 
per item;
    (b) Sensitive personal property, which is all personal property that 
is subject to theft and pilferage, as defined by the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization. All firearms shall be considered sensitive personal 
property; and
    (c) Real property provided by the Secretary for use under the 
contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.53   What kind of records shall the property management system maintain?

    The property management system shall maintain records that 
accurately describe the property, including any serial number or other 
identification number. These records should contain information such as 
the source, titleholder, acquisition date, cost, share of Federal 
participation in the cost, location, use and condition of the property, 
and the date of disposal and sale price, if any.


<R05>

Sec. 900.54   Should the property management system prescribe internal controls?

    Yes. Effective internal controls should include procedures:
    (a) For the conduct of periodic inventories;
    (b) To prevent loss or damage to property; and
    (c) To ensure that property is used for an Indian tribe or tribal 
organization's self-determination contract(s) until the property is 
declared excess to the needs of the contract consistent with the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization's property management system.


<R05>
Sec. 900.55   What are the standards for inventories?

    A physical inventory should be conducted at least once every 2 
years. The results of the inventory shall be reconciled with the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization's internal property and accounting records.


<R05>
Sec. 900.56   What maintenance is required for property?

    Required maintenance includes the performance of actions necessary 
to keep the property in good working condition, the procedures 
recommended by equipment manufacturers, and steps necessary to protect 
the interests of the contractor and the Secretary in any express 
warranties or guarantees covering the property.


<R05>
Sec. 900.57   What if the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses not to take title to property furnished or acquired under the contract?

    If the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses not to take title 
to property furnished by the government or acquired with contract funds, 
title to the property remains vested in the Secretary. A list of 
Federally-owned property to be used under the contract shall be included 
in the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 900.58   Do the same accountability and control procedures described above apply to Federal property?

    Yes, except that requirements for the inventory and disposal of 
Federal property are different.


<R05>
Sec. 900.59   How are the inventory requirements for Federal property different than for tribal property?

    There are three additional requirements:
    (a) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall conduct a physical 
inventory of the Federally-owned property and reconcile the results with 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization's property records annually, 
rather than every 2 years;
    (b) Within 90 days following the end of an annual funding agreement, 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall certify and submit to the 
Secretary an annual inventory of all Federally-owned real and personal 
property used in the contracted program; and
    (c) The inventory shall report any increase or decrease of $5,000 or 
more in the value of any item of real property.

[[Page 845]]


<R05>
Sec. 900.60   How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization dispose of Federal personal property?

    The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall report to the 
Secretary in writing any Federally-owned personal property that is worn 
out, lost, stolen, damaged beyond repair, or no longer needed for the 
performance of the contract.
    (a) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall state whether the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization wants to dispose of or return the 
property.
    (b) If the Secretary does not respond within 60 days, the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization may return the property to the Secretary, 
who shall accept transfer, custody, control, and responsibility for the 
property (together with all associated costs).


<R04>
          Subpart G--Programmatic Reports and Data Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 900.65   What programmatic reports and data shall the Indian tribe or tribal organization provide?

    Unless required by statute, there are no mandatory reporting 
requirements. Each Indian tribe or tribal organization shall negotiate 
with the Secretary the type and frequency of program narrative and 
program data report(s) which respond to the needs of the contracting 
parties and that are appropriate for the purposes of the contract. The 
extent of available resources will be a consideration in the 
negotiations.


<R05>
Sec. 900.66   What happens if the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary cannot come to an agreement concerning the type and/or frequency of 
          program narrative and/or program data report(s)?

    Any disagreements over reporting requirements are subject to the 
declination criteria and procedures in section 102 of the Act and 
subpart E.


<R05>
Sec. 900.67   Will there be a uniform data set for all IHS programs?

    IHS will work with Indian tribe or tribal organization 
representatives to develop a mutually defined uniform subset of data 
that is consistent with Congressional intent, imposes a minimal 
reporting burden, and which responds to the needs of the contracting 
parties.


<R05>
Sec. 900.68   Will this uniform data set be required of all Indian tribe or tribal organizations contracting with the IHS under the Act?

    No. The uniform data set, applicable to the services to be 
performed, will serve as the target for the Secretary and the Indian 
tribes or tribal organizations during individual negotiations on program 
data reporting requirements.


<R04>
      Subpart H--Lease of Tribally-Owned Buildings by the Secretary


<R05>
Sec. 900.69   What is the purpose of this subpart?

    Section 105(l) of the Act requires the Secretary, at the request of 
an Indian tribe or tribal organization, to enter into a lease with the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization for a building owned or leased by 
the tribe or tribal organization that is used for administration or 
delivery of services under the Act. The lease is to include compensation 
as provided in the statute as well as ``such other reasonable expenses 
that the Secretary determines, by regulation, to be allowable.'' This 
subpart contains requirements for these leases.


<R05>

Sec. 900.70   What elements are included in the compensation for a lease entered into between the Secretary and an Indian tribe or tribal organization for a

<R05>

Sec. 900.71   What type of reserve fund is anticipated for funds deposited into a reserve for replacement of facilities as specified in Sec. 900.70(c)?

    Reserve funds must be accounted for as a capital project fund or a 
special revenue fund.

fund.
    (b) Funds may be invested in accordance with the laws, regulations

<R05>

Sec. 900.73   Is a lease with the Secretary the only method available to recover the types of cost described in Sec. 900.70?

    No. With the exception of paragraph (i) in Sec. 900.70, the same 
types of costs may be recovered in whole or in part under section 106(a) 
of the Act as direct or indirect charges to a self-determination 
contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.74   How may an Indian tribe or tribal organization propose a lease to be compensated for the use of facilities?

the donation as expeditiously as possible.
    (c) If more than one request for the same parcel of real property is

works of art), and special purpose equipment, when part of a 
construction contract let under this subpart.
    (2) While planning services and construction management services as

<R05>

Sec. 900.112  What are construction phases?

    (a) Construction programs generally include the following activities 
in phases which can vary by funding source (an Indian tribe or tribal 
organization should contact its funding source for more information 
regarding the conduct of its program):
    (1) The preplanning phase. The phase during which an initial 
assessment and determination of project need is made and supporting 
information collected for presentation in a project application. This 
project application process is explained in more detail in Sec. 900.122;
    (2) The planning phase. The phase during which planning services are 
provided. This phase can include conducting and preparing a detailed 
needs assessment, developing justification documents, completing and/or 
verifying master plans, conducting predesign site investigations and 
selection, developing budget cost estimates, conducting feasibility 
studies, and developing a project Program of Requirements (POR);
    (3) The design phase. The phase during which licensed design 
professional(s) using the POR as the basis for design of the project, 
prepare project plans, specifications, and other documents that are a 
part of the construction documents used to build the project. Site 
investigation and selection activities are completed in this phase if 
not conducted as part of the planning phase.
    (4) The construction phase. The phase during which the project is 
constructed. The construction phase includes providing the labor, 
materials, equipment, and services necessary to complete the work in 
accordance with the construction documents prepared as part of the 
design phase.
    (b) The following activities may be part of phases described in 
paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section:
    (1) Management; and
    (2) Environmental, archeological, cultural resource, historic 
preservation, and similar assessments and associated activities.


<R05>

Sec. 900.113  Definitions.

    (a) Construction contract means a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement 
self-determination contract for a construction project, except that such 
term does not include any contract:
    (1) That is limited to providing planning services and construction 
management services (or a combination of such services);
    (2) For the Housing Improvement Program or roads maintenance program 
of the Bureau of Indian Affairs administered by the Secretary of the 
Interior; or
    (3) For the health facility maintenance and improvement program 
administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

[[Page 853]]

    (b) Construction management services (CMS) means activities limited 
to administrative support services; coordination; and monitoring 
oversight of the planning, design, and construction process. An Indian 
tribe or tribal organization's employee or construction management 
services consultant (typically an engineer or architect) performs such 
activities as:
    (1) Coordination and information exchange between the Indian tribe 
or tribal organization and the Federal government;
    (2) Preparation of Indian tribe or tribal organization's 
construction contract proposals;
    (3) Indian tribe or tribal organization subcontract scope of work 
identification and subcontract preparation, and competitive selection of 
Indian tribe or tribal organization construction contract subcontractors 
(see Sec. 900.110);
    (4) Review of work to ensure compliance with the POR and/or the 
construction contract. This does not involve construction project 
management as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Construction programs include programs for the planning, design, 
construction, repair, improvement, and expansion of buildings or 
facilities, including but not limited to, housing, law enforcement and 
detention facilities, sanitation and water systems, roads, schools, 
administration and health facilities, irrigation and agricultural work, 
water conservation, flood control, and port facilities, and 
environmental, archeological, cultural resource, historic preservation, 
and conduct of similar assessments.
    (d) Construction project management means direct responsibility for 
the construction project through day-to-day on-site management and 
administration of the project. Activities may include cost management, 
project budgeting, project scheduling, procurement services.
    (e) Design means services performed by licensed design professionals 
related to preparing drawings, specifications, and other design 
submissions specified in the contract, as well as services provided by 
or for licensed design professionals during the bidding/negotiating, 
construction, and operational phases of the project.
    (f) Planning services means activities undertaken to support agency 
and/or Congressional funding of a construction project. Planning 
services may include performing a needs assessment, completing and/or 
verifying master plans, developing justification documents, conducting 
pre-design site investigations, developing budget cost estimates, 
conducting feasibility studies as needed and completion of approved 
justification documents and a program of requirements (POR) for the 
project.
    (g) Program of Requirements (POR) is a planning document developed 
during the planning phase for an individual project. It provides 
background about the project; site information; programmatic needs; and, 
for facilities projects, a detailed room-by-room listing of spaces, 
including net and gross sizes, finish materials to be used, furnishings 
and equipment, and other information and design criteria on which to 
base the construction project documents.
    (h) Scope of work means the description of the work to be provided 
through a contract issued under this subpart and the methods and 
processes to be used to accomplish that work. A scope of work is 
typically developed based on criteria provided in a POR during the 
design phase, and project construction documents (plans and 
specifications) during the construction phase.


<R05>

Sec. 900.114  Why is there a separate subpart in these regulations for construction contracts and grants?

    There is a separate subpart because the Act differentiates between 
construction contracts and the model agreement in section 108 of the Act 
which is required for contracting other activities. Construction 
contracts are separately defined in the Act and are subject to a 
separate proposal and review process.


<R05>

Sec. 900.115  How do self-determination construction contracts relate to ordinary Federal procurement contracts?

    (a) A self-determination construction contract is a government-to-
government agreement that transfers control of the construction project, 
including

[[Page 854]]

administrative functions, to the contracting Indian tribe or tribal 
organization to facilitate effective and meaningful participation by the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization in planning, conducting, and 
administering the construction project, and so that the construction 
project is responsive to the true needs of the Indian community. The 
Secretary's role in the conduct of a contracted construction project is 
limited to the Secretary's responsibilities set out in Sec. 900.131.
    (b) Self-determination construction contracts are not traditional 
``procurement'' contracts.
    (1) With respect to a construction contract (or a subcontract of 
such a construction contract), the provisions of the Office of Federal 
Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) and the regulations 
promulgated under that Act, shall apply to a construction contract or 
subcontract only to the extent that application of the provision is:
    (i) Necessary to ensure that the contract may be carried out in a 
satisfactory manner;
    (ii) Directly related to the construction activity; and
    (iii) Not inconsistent with the Act.
    (2) A list of the Federal requirements that meet the requirements of 
this paragraph shall be included in an attachment to the contract under 
negotiations between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no 
Federal law listed in section 105(3)(C)(ii) of the Act or any other 
provision of Federal law (including an Executive order) relating to 
acquisition by the Federal government shall apply to a construction 
contract that an Indian tribe or tribal organization enters into under 
this Act, unless expressly provided in the law.
    (c) Provisions of a construction contract under this subpart shall 
be liberally construed in favor of the contracting Indian tribe or 
tribal organization.


<R05>

Sec. 900.116  Are negotiated fixed-price contracts treated the same as cost-reimbursable contracts?

    Yes, except that in negotiated fixed-price construction contracts, 
appropriate clauses shall be negotiated to allocate properly the 
contract risks between the government and the contractor.


<R05>

Sec. 900.117  Do these ``construction contract'' regulations apply to planning services?

    (a) These regulations apply to planning services contracts only as 
provided in this section.
    (1) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit to the 
Secretary for review and approval the POR documents produced as a part

<R05>

Sec. 900.118  Do these ``construction contract'' regulations apply to construction management services?

     No. Construction management services may be contracted separately 
under section 108 of the Act. Construction management services 
consultants and/or Indian tribe or tribal organization employees assist 
and advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization to implement 
construction contracts, but have no contractual relationship with or 
authority to direct construction contract subcontractors.
    (a) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses to contract 
solely for construction management services, these services shall be 
limited to:
    (1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary;
    (2) Review of work produced by the Secretary to determine compliance 
with:
    (i) The POR and design contract during the design stage; or
    (ii) The project construction documents during the construction 
stage;
    (3) Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the disputes 
clause of the CMS contract.
    (b) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization conducts CMS under 
section 108 of the Act and the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
contracts separately under this subpart for all or some of the 
activities in Sec. 900.110, the contracted activities shall be limited 
to:
    (1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization and Secretary;
    (2) Preparation of tribal or tribal organization construction 
subcontract scope of work identification and subcontract preparation, 
and competitive selection of tribal or tribal organization construction 
contract subcontractors;
    (3) Review of work produced by tribal or tribal organization 
construction subcontractors to determine compliance with:
    (i) The POR and the design contract during the design stage; or
    (ii) The project construction documents during the construction 
stage.


<R05>

Sec. 900.119  To what extent shall the Secretary consult with affected Indian tribes before spending funds for any construction project?

    Before spending any funds for a planning, design, construction, or 
renovation project, whether subject to a competitive application and 
ranking process or not, the Secretary shall consult with any Indian 
tribe or tribal organization(s) that would be significantly affected by 
the expenditure to determine and to follow tribal preferences to the 
greatest extent feasible concerning: size, location, type, and other 
characteristics of the project.


<R05>

Sec. 900.120  How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization find out about a construction project?

    Within 30 days after the Secretary's allocation of funds for 
planning phase, design phase, or construction phase activities for a 
specific project, the Secretary shall notify, by registered mail with 
return receipt in order to document mailing, the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization(s) to be benefitted by the availability of the funds for 
each phase of a project. The Secretarial notice of fund allocation shall 
offer technical assistance in the preparation of a contract proposal.
    (a) The Secretary shall, within 30 days after receiving a request 
from an Indian tribe or tribal organization, furnish the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization with all information available to

[[Page 856]]

the Secretary about the project including, but not limited to: 
construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans 
of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or 
environmental impact reports and archeological reports.
    (b) An Indian tribe or tribal organization is not required to 
request this information prior to submitting a notification of intent to 
contract or a contract proposal.
    (c) The Secretary shall have a continuing responsibility to furnish 
information.


<R05>

Sec. 900.121  What happens during the preplanning phase and can an Indian tribe or tribal organization perform any of the activities involved in this process?

    (a) The application and ranking process for developing a priority 
listing of projects varies between agencies. There are, however, steps 
in the selection process that are common to most selection processes. An 
Indian tribe or tribal organization that wishes to secure a construction 
project should contact the appropriate agency to determine the specific 
steps involved in the application and selection process used to fund 
specific types of projects. When a priority process is used in the 
selection of construction projects, the steps involved in the 
application and ranking process are as follows:
    (1) Application. The agency solicits applications from Indian tribes 
or tribal organizations. In the request for applications, the Secretary 
provides specific information regarding the type of project to be 
funded, the objective criteria that will be used to evaluate 
applications, the points or weight that each criterion will be assigned, 
and the time when applications are due. An Indian tribe or tribal 
organization may prepare the application (technical assistance from the 
agency, within resources available, shall be provided upon request from 
an Indian tribe or tribal organization) or may rely upon the agency to 
prepare the application.
    (2) Ranking/Prioritization. The Secretary evaluates the applications 
based on the criteria provided as part of the application preparation 
process. The Secretary applies only criteria and weights assigned to 
each criteria that were disclosed to the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization during the application stage. The applications are then 
ranked in order from the application that best meets application 
criteria to the application that least meet the application criteria.
    (3) Validation. Before final acceptance of a ranked application, the 
information, such as demographic information, deficiency levels reported 
in application, the condition of existing facilities, and program 
housing needs, is validated. During this process, additional information 
may be developed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in support 
of the original information or the Secretary may designate a 
representative of the Department to conduct an on-site review of the 
information contained in the application.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>

Sec. 900.122  What does an Indian tribe or tribal organization do if it wants to secure a construction contract?

    (a) The Act establishes a special process for review and negotiation 
of proposals for construction contracts which is different than that for 
other self-determination contract proposals. The Indian tribe or tribal 
organization should notify the Secretary of its intent to contract. 
After notification, the Indian tribe or tribal organization should 
prepare its contract proposal in accordance with the sections of this 
subpart. While developing its construction contract proposal, the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization can request technical assistance from the 
Secretary. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request from an 
Indian tribe or tribal organization, the Secretary shall provide to the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization all information available about the 
construction project, including construction drawings, maps, engineering 
reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, 
environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports, and 
archaeological reports. The responsibility of the Secretary to furnish 
this information shall be a continuing one.
    (b) At the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization and 
before finalizing its construction contract proposal, the Secretary 
shall provide for a

[[Page 857]]

precontract negotiation phase during the development of a contract 
proposal. Within 30 days the Secretary shall acknowledge receipt of the 
proposal and, if requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, 
shall confer with the Indian tribe or tribal organization to develop a 
negotiation schedule. The negotiation phase shall include, at a minimum:
    (1) The provision of technical assistance under section 103 of the 
Act and paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) A joint scoping session between the Secretary and the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization to review all plans, specifications, 
engineering reports, cost estimates, and other information available to 
the parties, for the purpose of identifying all areas of agreement and 
disagreement;
    (3) An opportunity for the Secretary to revise plans, designs, or 
cost estimates of the Secretary in response to concerns raised, or 
information provided by, the Indian tribe or tribal organization;
    (4) A negotiation session during which the Secretary and the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization shall seek to develop a mutually agreeable 
contract proposal; and
    (5) Upon the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization, the 
use of alternative dispute resolution to resolve remaining areas of 
disagreement under the dispute resolution provisions under subchapter IV 
of chapter 5 of the United States Code.


<R05>

Sec. 900.123  What happens if the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary cannot develop a mutually agreeable contract proposal?

    (a) If the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization are 
unable to develop a mutually agreeable construction contract proposal 
under the procedures in Sec. 900.122, the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization may submit a final contract proposal to the Secretary. Not 
later than 30 days after receiving the final contract proposal, the 
Secretary shall approve the contract proposal and award the contract, 
unless, during the period the Secretary declines the proposal under 
sections 102(a)(2) and 102(b) of the Act (including providing 
opportunity for an appeal under section 102(b)).
    (b) Whenever the Secretary declines to enter into a self-
determination contract or contracts under section 102(a)(2) of the Act, 
the Secretary shall:
    (1) State any objections to the contract proposal (as submitted by 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization) in writing and provide all 
documents relied on in making the declination decision within 20 days of 
such decision to the Indian tribe or tribal organization;
    (2) Provide assistance to the Indian tribe or tribal organization to 
overcome the stated objections;
    (3) Provide the Indian tribe or tribal organization with a hearing 
on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any 
issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the 
objections raised, under the regulations set forth in subpart L, except 
that the Indian tribe or tribal organization may, in lieu of filing the 
appeal, initiate an action in a Federal district court and proceed 
directly under section 110(a) of the Act.


<R05>

Sec. 900.124  May the Indian tribe or tribal organization to use a grant in lieu of a contract?

    Yes. A grant agreement or a cooperative agreement may be used in 
lieu of a contract under sections 102 and 103 of the Act when agreed to 
by the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Under the 
grant concept, the grantee will assume full responsibility and 
accountability for design and construction performance within the 
funding limitations. The grantee will manage and administer the work 
with minimal involvement by the government. The grantee will be expected 
to have acceptable management systems for finance, procurement, and 
property. The Secretary may issue Federal construction guidelines and 
manuals applicable to its construction programs, and the government 
shall accept tribal proposals for alternatives which are consistent with 
or exceed Federal guidelines or manuals applicable to construction 
programs.

[[Page 858]]


<R05>

Sec. 900.125  What shall a construction contract proposal contain?

    (a) In addition to the full name, address, and telephone number of

<R05>

Sec. 900.126   Shall a construction contract proposal incorporate provisions of Federal construction guidelines and manuals?

    Each agency may provide or the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
may request Federal construction guidelines and manuals for 
consideration by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in the 
preparation of its contract proposal. If tribal construction procedures, 
standards and methods (including national, regional, State, or tribal 
building codes or construction industry standards) are consistent with 
or exceed applicable Federal standards, the Secretary shall accept the 
tribally proposed standards.


<R05>

Sec. 900.127   What can be included in the Indian tribe or tribal organization's contract budget?

These costs include:
    (1) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
of performing the contract, taking into consideration the terms of the 
contract and the requirements of the Act and any other applicable law;
    (2) The costs of preparing the contract proposal and supporting cost 
data;
    (3) The costs associated with auditing the general and 
administrative costs of the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
associated with the management of the construction contract; and
    (4) In cases where the Indian tribe or tribal organization is 
submitting a fixed-price construction contract:
    (i) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
for general administration incurred in connection with the project that 
is the subject of the contract;
    (ii) The ability of the contractor that carries out the construction 
contract to make a reasonable profit, taking into consideration the 
risks associated with carrying out the contract, local market 
conditions, and other relevant considerations.
    (d) In establishing a contract budget for a construction project, 
the Secretary shall not be required to identify separately the 
components described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) of this

In the event provision of required contingency funds will cause the 
project to exceed available project

[[Page 861]]

funds, the discrepancy shall be reconciled in accordance with 
Sec. 900.129(e). Any additional contingency funds for the construction 
phase will be negotiated on an as-needed basis subject to the 
availability of funds and the nature, scope, and complexity of the 
project. Any contingency for other phases will be negotiated on a

the Secretary is not required to identify separately the components 
described in paragraph (d) (1) and (d) (2) of this sections.


<R05>

Sec. 900.129   How do the Secretary and Indian tribe or tribal organization arrive at an overall fair and reasonable price for the performance of a construction 
          contract?

    (a) Throughout the contract award process, the Secretary and Indian 
tribe or tribal organization shall share all construction project cost 
information available to them in order to facilitate reaching agreement 
on an overall fair and reasonable price for the project or part thereof. 
In order to enhance this communication, the government's estimate of an 
overall fair and reasonable price shall:
    (1) Contain a level of detail appropriate to the nature and phase of 
the work and sufficient to allow comparisons to the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization's estimate;
    (2) Be prepared in a format coordinated with the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization; and
    (3) Include the cost elements contained in section 105(m)(4) of the 
Act.
    (b) The government's cost estimate shall be an independent cost 
estimate based on such information as the following:
    (1) Prior costs to the government for similar projects adjusted for 
comparison to the target location, typically in unit costs, such as 
dollars per pound, square meter cost of building, or other unit cost 
that can be used to make a comparison;
    (2) Actual costs previously incurred by the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization for similar projects;
    (3) Published price lists, to include regional adjustment factors, 
for materials, equipment, and labor; and
    (4) Projections of inflation and cost trends, including projected 
changes such as labor, material, and transportation costs.
    (c) The Secretary shall provide the initial government cost estimate 
to the Indian tribe or tribal organization and make appropriate 
revisions based on concerns raised or information provided by the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization. The Secretary and the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization shall continue to revise, as appropriate, their 
respective cost estimates based on

[[Page 862]]

changed or additional information such as the following:
    (1) Actual subcontract bids;
    (2) Changes in inflation rates and market conditions, including 
local market conditions;
    (3) Cost and price analyses conducted by the Secretary and the 
Indian tribe or tribal organization during negotiations;
    (4) Agreed-upon changes in the size, scope and schedule of the 
construction project; and
    (5) Agreed-upon changes in project plans and specifications.
    (d) Considering all of the information available, the Secretary and 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall negotiate the amount of 
the construction contract. The objective of the negotiations is to 
arrive at an amount that is fair under current market conditions and 
reasonable to both the government and the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization. As a result, the agreement does not necessarily have to be 
in strict conformance with either party's cost estimate nor does 
agreement have to be reached on every element of cost, but only on the 
overall fair and reasonable price of each phase of the work included in 
the contract.
    (e) If the fair and reasonable price arrived at under paragraph (d) 
of this section would exceed the amount available to the Secretary, 
then:
    (1) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to submit a 
final proposal, the Secretary may decline the proposal under section 
105(m)(4)(C)(v) of the Act or if the contract has been awarded, dispute 
the matter under the Contract Disputes Act; or
    (2) If requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization:
    (i) The Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary may 
jointly explore methods of expanding the available funds through the use 
of contingency funds, advance payments in accordance with Sec. 900.132, 
rebudgeting, or seeking additional appropriations; or
    (ii) The Indian tribe or tribal organization may elect to propose a

Sec. 900.132  Once a contract and/or grant is awarded, how will the Indian tribe or tribal organization receive payments?

    (a) A schedule for advance payments shall be developed based on 
progress, need, and other considerations in accordance with applicable

not later than 7 days before the end of the first allocation period.
    (e) Not later than 7 days before the end of each subsequent 
allocation period after the second allocation, the Secretary shall 
transfer to the Indian tribe or tribal organization the amount for the 
next allocation period, unless the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
is delinquent in submission of allocation period progress reports and 
financial reports or the Secretary takes action to suspend or terminate 
the contract in accordance with Sec. 900.131(b)(11), 
Sec. 900.131(b)(12), or Sec. 900.131(b)(13).


<R05>

Sec. 900.133  Does the declination process or the Contract Dispute Act apply to construction contract amendments proposed either by an Indian tribe or tribal 
          organization or the Secretary?

    The Contract Disputes Act generally applies to such amendments. 
However, the declination process and the procedures in Sec. 900.122 and 
Sec. 900.123 apply to the proposal by an Indian tribe or tribal 
organization when the proposal is for a new project, a new phase or 
discreet stage of a phase of a project, or an expansion of a project 
resulting from an additional allocation of funds by the Secretary under 
Sec. 900.120.


<R05>

Sec. 900.134  At the end of a self-determination construction contract, what happens to savings on a cost-reimbursement contract?

    The savings shall be used by the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
to provide additional services or benefits under the contract. 
Unexpended contingency funds obligated to the contract, and remaining at 
the end of the contract, are savings. No further approval or justifying 
documentation by the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be 
required before expenditure of funds.


<R05>

Sec. 900.135  May the time frames for action set out in this subpart be reduced?

    Yes. The time frames in this subpart are intended to be maximum 
times and may be reduced based on urgency and need, by agreement of the 
parties. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization requests reduced 
time frames for action due to unusual or special conditions (such as 
limited construction periods), the Secretary shall make a good faith 
effort to accommodate the requested time frames.


<R05>

Sec. 900.136  Do tribal employment rights ordinances apply to construction contracts and subcontracts?

    Yes. Tribal employment rights ordinances do apply to construction 
contracts and subcontracts pursuant to section 7(b) and section 7(c) of 
the Act.

<R05>

Sec. 900.140  Can any provision of the regulations under this part be waived?

    Yes. Upon the request of an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the 
Secretary shall waive any provision of these regulations, including any 
cost principles adopted by the regulations under this part, if the 
Secretary finds that granting the waiver is either in the best interest 
of the Indians served by the contract, or is consistent with the 
policies of the Act and is not contrary to statutory law.


<R05>

Sec. 900.141  How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get a waiver?

    To obtain a waiver, an Indian tribe or tribal organization shall 
submit a written request to the Secretary identifying the regulation to 
be waived and the

[[Page 868]]

basis for the request. The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall 
explain the intended effect of the waiver, the impact upon the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization if the waiver is not granted, and the 
specific contract(s) to which the waiver will apply.


<R05>

Sec. 900.142  Does an Indian tribe or tribal organization's waiver request have to be included in an initial contract proposal?

    No. Although a waiver request may be included in a contract 
proposal, it can also be submitted separately.



<R05>

Sec. 900.143  How is a waiver request processed?

    The Secretary shall approve or deny a waiver within 90 days after 
the Secretary receives a written waiver request. The Secretary's

for the decision.


<R05>

Sec. 900.144  What happens if the Secretary makes no decision within the 90-day period?

    The waiver request is deemed approved.


<R05>

Sec. 900.145  On what basis may the Secretary deny a waiver request?

    Consistent with section 107(e) of the Act, the Secretary may only 
deny a waiver request based on a specific written finding. The finding 
must clearly demonstrate (or be supported by controlling legal 
authority) that if the waiver is granted:
    (a) The service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the 
particular program or function to be contracted will not be 
satisfactory;
    (b) Adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;
    (c) The proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be 
properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;
    (d) The amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of 
the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under 
section 106(a) of the Act; or
    (e) The program, function, service, or activity (or portion of it) 
that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, 
functions, services, or activities that are contractible under the Act 
because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried 
out by the contractor.


<R05>

Sec. 900.146  Is technical assistance available for waiver requests?

    Yes. Technical assistance is available as provided in Sec. 900.7 to 
prepare a waiver request or to overcome any stated objection which the 
Secretary might have to the request.


<R05>

Sec. 900.147  What appeal rights are available?

    If the Secretary denies a waiver request, the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization has the right to appeal the decision and request a hearing 
on the record under the procedures for hearings and appeals contained in 
subpart L of these regulations. Alternatively, the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization may sue in Federal district court to challenge the 
Secretary's action.


<R05>

Sec. 900.148  How can an Indian tribe or tribal organization secure a determination that a law or regulation has been superseded by the Indian Self-
          Determination Act, as specified in section 107(b) of the Act?

    Any Indian tribe or tribal organization may at any time submit a 
request to the Secretary for a determination that any law or regulation 
has been superseded by the Act and that the law has no applicability to 
any contract or proposed contract under the Act. The Secretary is 
required to provide an initial decision on such a request within 90 days 
after receipt. If such a request is denied, the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization may appeal under subpart L of these regulations. The 
Secretary shall provide notice of each determination made under this 
subpart to all Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

[[Page 870]]


<R05>

Sec. 900.154  How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization request an informal conference?

    The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall file its request for 
an informal conference with the office of the person whose decision it 
is appealing, within 30 days of the day it receives the decision. The 
Indian tribe or tribal organization may either hand-deliver the request 
for an informal conference to that person's office, or mail it by

the informal conference. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization does 
not file a notice of appeal within 30 days, or before the expiration of 
the extension it has received under Sec. 900.159, the recommended 
decision becomes final.


<R05>

Sec. 900.158  How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization appeal the initial decision, if it does not request an informal conference or if it does not agree 
          with the recommended decision resulting from the informal

organization's notice of appeal, the IBIA will decide whether the appeal 
falls under Sec. 900.150(a) through Sec. 900.150(g). If so, the Indian 
tribe or tribal organization is entitled to a hearing.
    (1) If the IBIA determines that the appeal of the Indian tribe or 
tribal organization falls under Sec. 900.150(h), Sec. 900.150(i), or 
Sec. 900.150(j), and the Indian tribe or tribal organization has 
requested a hearing, the IBIA will grant the request for a hearing 
unless the IBIA determines that there are no genuine issues of material 
fact to be resolved.
    (2) If the IBIA cannot make that decision based on the information 
included in the notice of appeal, the IBIA may ask for additional 
statements from the Indian tribe or tribal organization, or from the 
appropriate Federal agency. If the IBIA asks for more statements, it 
will make its decision within 5 days of receiving those statements.
    (b) If the IBIA decides that the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
is not entitled to a hearing or if the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization has waived its right to a hearing on the record, the IBIA 
will ask for the administrative record under 43 CFR 4.335. The IBIA 
shall tell the parties that the appeal will be considered under the 
regulations at 43 CFR 4, subpart D, except the case shall be docketed 
immediately, without waiting for the 20-day period described in 43 CFR 
4.336.

the appeal based on the written record. At the pre-hearing conference 
the ALJ will provide for:

<R05>

Sec. 900.183  Do Indian tribes and tribal organizations need to be aware of areas which FTCA does not cover?

    Yes. There are claims against self-determination contractors which 
are not covered by FTCA, claims which may not be pursued under FTCA, and 
remedies that are excluded by FTCA. General guidance is provided below 
as to these matters but is not intended as a definitive description of 
coverage, which is subject to review by the Department of Justice and 
the courts on a case-by-case basis.

be made against the United States, an Indian tribe or tribal 
organization? Any claim under 28 U.S.C. 2680, including claims arising 
out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious 
prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, 
deceit, or interference with contract rights, unless otherwise 
authorized by 28 U.S.C. 2680(h).

    (3) Claims for breach of contract rather than tort claims; or
    (4) Claims resulting from activities performed by an employee which 
are outside the scope of employment.
    (c) What remedies are expressly excluded by FTCA and therefore are 
barred?

clauses to clarify the scope of FTCA coverage:
    (a) The following clause may be used for all contracts:

    For purposes of Federal Tort Claims Act coverage, the contractor and 
its employees (including individuals performing personal services 
contracts with the contractor to provide health care services) are 
deemed to be employees of the Federal government while performing work 
under this contract. This status is not changed by the source of the 
funds used by the contractor to pay the employee's salary and benefits 
unless the employee receives additional compensation for performing 
covered services from anyone other than the contractor.

    (b) The following clause is for IHS contracts only:

    Under this contract, the contractor's employee may be required as a 
condition of employment to provide health services to non-IHS 
beneficiaries in order to meet contractual obligations. These services 
may be provided in either contractor or non-contractor facilities. The 
employee's status for Federal Tort Claims Act purposes is not affected.


<R05>

Sec. 900.187  Does FTCA apply to a self-determination contract if FTCA is not referenced in the contract?

    Yes.

    (8) Copies of all relevant documentation, including available police

representatives of the Secretary to settle or defend any claim and to 
represent the contractor in or take charge of any action. If the Federal 
government undertakes the settlement or defense of any claim or action 
the contractor shall provide all reasonable additional assistance in 
reaching a settlement or asserting a defense.


<R05>

Sec. 900.189  Does this coverage extend to subcontractors of self-determination contracts?

    No. Subcontractors or subgrantees providing services to a Public Law 
93-638 contractor or grantee are generally not covered. The only 
exceptions are Indian contractors such as those under subcontract with 
the California Rural Indian Health Board to carry out IHS programs in 
geographically defined service areas in California and personal services 
contracts under Sec. 900.193 (for Sec. 900.183(b)(1)) or Sec. 900.183(b) 
(for Sec. 900.190).

                         Medical-Related Claims

related functions by the contractor in carrying out self-determination 
contracts under the Act. Related functions include services such as 
those provided by nurses, laboratory and x-ray technicians, emergency

the FTCA.


<R05>

Sec. 900.191  Are employees of self-determination contractors providing health services under the self-determination contract protected by FTCA?

[[Page 878]]

    (e) Federal employees assigned to the contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.193  Does FTCA coverage extend to individuals who provide health care services under a personal services contract providing services in a facility that 
          is owned, operated, or constructed under the jurisdiction of 
          the IHS?

    Yes. The coverage extends to individual personal services 
contractors providing health services in such a facility, including a 
facility owned by an Indian tribe or tribal organization but operated 
under a self-determination contract with IHS.


<R05>

Sec. 900.194  Does FTCA coverage extend to services provided under a staff privileges agreement with a non-IHS facility where the agreement requires a health 
          care practitioner to provide reciprocal services to the 
          general population?

    Yes. Those services are covered, as long as the contractor's health 
care practitioners do not receive additional compensation from a third 
party for the performance of these services and they are acting within 
the scope of their employment under a self-determination contract. 
Reciprocal services include:
    (a) Cross-covering other medical personnel who temporarily cannot 
attend their patients;
    (b) Assisting other personnel with surgeries or other medical 
procedures;
    (c) Assisting with unstable patients or at deliveries; or
    (d) Assisting in any patient care situation where additional 
assistance by health care personnel is needed.


<R05>

Sec. 900.195  Does FTCA coverage extend to the contractor's health care practitioners providing services to private patients on a fee-for-services basis when 
          such personnel (not the self-determination contractor) receive 
          the fee?

    No.


<R05>

Sec. 900.196  Do covered services include the conduct of clinical studies and investigations and the provision of emergency services, including the operation of 
          emergency motor vehicles?

    Yes, if the services are provided in carrying out a self-
determination contract. (An emergency motor vehicle is a vehicle, 
whether government, contractor, or employee-owned, used to transport 
passengers for medical services.)


<R05>

Sec. 900.197  Does FTCA cover employees of the contractor who are paid by the contractor from funds other than those provided through the self-determination 
          contract?

    Yes, as long as the services out of which the claim arose were 
performed in carrying out the self-determination contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.198  Are Federal employees assigned to a self-determination contractor under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act or detailed under section 214 of the 
          Public Health Service Act covered to the same extent that they 
          would be if working directly for a Federal agency?

    Yes.


<R05>

Sec. 900.199  Does FTCA coverage extend to health care practitioners to whom staff privileges have been extended in contractor health care facilities operated 
          under a self-determination contract on the condition that such 
          practitioner provide health services to IHS beneficiaries 
          covered by FTCA?

    Yes, health care practitioners with staff privileges in a facility 
operated by a contractor are covered when they perform services to IHS 
beneficiaries. Such personnel are not covered when providing services to 
non-IHS beneficiaries.


<R05>

Sec. 900.200  May persons who are not Indians or Alaska Natives assert claims under FTCA?

    Yes. Non-Indian individuals served under the contract whether or not 
on a fee-for-service basis, may assert claims under this subpart.

<R04>
                 Subpart N--Post-Award Contract Disputes


<R05>

Sec. 900.215   What does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart covers:
    (1) All HHS and DOI self-determination contracts, including 
construction contracts; and
    (2) All disputes regarding an awarding official's decision relating 
to a self-determination contract.
    (b) This subpart does not cover the decisions of an awarding 
official that are covered under subpart L.


<R05>

Sec. 900.216   What other statutes and regulations apply to contract disputes?

    (a) The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), Public Law 95-563 (41 
U.S.C. 601 as amended);
    (b) If the matter is submitted to the Interior Board of Contract 
Appeals, 43 CFR 4.110-126; and
    (c) The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 and 28 U.S.C. 2412 
and regulations at 43 CFR 4.601 through 4.619 (DOI) and 45 CFR 13 
(DHHS).


<R05>

Sec. 900.217   Is filing a claim under the CDA our only option for resolving post-award contract disputes?

    No. The Federal government attempts to resolve all contract disputes 
by agreement at the awarding official's level. These are alternatives to 
filing a claim under the CDA:
    (a) Before issuing a decision on a claim, the awarding official 
should consider using informal discussions between the parties, assisted 
by individuals who have not substantially participated in the matter, to 
aid in resolving differences.
    (b) In addition to filing a CDA claim, or instead of filing a CDA 
claim, the parties may choose to use an alternative dispute resolution 
mechanism, pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Dispute 
Resolution Act, Public Law 101-552, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 581 et seq., or 
the options listed in section 108(1)(b)(12) of the Indian Self-
Determination Act, as applicable.

[[Page 881]]


<R05>

Sec. 900.218   What is a claim under the CDA?

    (a) A claim is a written demand by one of the contracting parties, 
asking for one or more of the following:
    (1) Payment of a specific sum of money under the contract;
    (2) Adjustment or interpretation of contract terms; or
    (3) Any other claim relating to the contract.
    (b) However, an undisputed voucher, invoice, or other routing 
request for payment is not a claim under the CDA. A voucher, invoice, or 
routing request for payment may be converted into a CDA claim if:
    (1) It is disputed as to liability or amount; or
    (2) It is not acted upon in a reasonable time and written notice of 
the claim is given to the awarding official by the senior official 
designated in the contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.219   How does an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Federal agency submit a claim?

    (a) An Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit its claim in 
writing to the awarding official. The awarding official shall document 
the contract file with evidence of the date the claim was received.
    (b) A Federal agency shall submit its claim in writing to the 
contractor's senior official, as designated in the contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.220   Does it make a difference whether the claim is large or small?

    Yes. The Contract Disputes Act requires that an Indian tribe or 
tribal organization making a claim for more than $100,000 shall certify 
that:
    (a) The claim is made in good faith,
    (b) Supporting documents or data are accurate and complete to the 
best of the Indian tribe or tribal organization's knowledge and belief;
    (c) The amount claimed accurately reflects the amount believed to be 
owed by the Federal government; and
    (d) The person making the certification is authorized to do so on 
behalf of the Indian tribe or tribal organization.


<R05>

Sec. 900.221   What happens next?

    (a) If the parties do not agree on a settlement, the awarding 
official will issue a written decision on the claim.
    (b) The awarding official shall always give a copy of the decision 
to the Indian tribe or tribal organization by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, or by any other method which provides a receipt.


<R05>

Sec. 900.222   What goes into a decision?

    A decision shall:
    (a) Describe the claim or dispute;
    (b) Refer to the relevant terms of the contract;
    (c) Set out the factual areas of agreement and disagreement;
    (d) Set out the actual decision, based on the facts, and outline the 
reasoning which supports the decision; and
    (e) Contain the following language:

    This is a final decision. You may appeal this decision to the 
Interior Board of Contract Appeals (IBCA), U.S. Department of the 
Interior, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22203. If you decide to 
appeal, you shall, within 90 days from the date you receive this 
decision, mail or otherwise furnish written notice to the IBCA and 
provide a copy to the individual from whose decision the appeal is 
taken. The notice shall indicate that an appeal is intended, and refer 
to the decision and contract number. Instead of appealing to the IBCA, 
you may bring an action in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims or in the 
United States District Court within 12 months of the date you receive 
this notice.


<R05>

Sec. 900.223   When does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get the decision?

    (a) If the claim is for more than $100,000, the awarding official 
shall issue the decision within 60 days of the day he or she receives 
the claim. If the awarding official cannot issue a decision that 
quickly, he or she shall tell you when the decision will be issued.
    (b) If the claim is for $100,000 or less, and you want a decision 
within 60 days, you shall advise the awarding official in writing that 
you want a decision within that period. If you advise the awarding 
official in writing that you do want a decision within 60 days, the 
awarding official shall issue the decision within 60 days of the day he 
or she receives your written notice.

[[Page 882]]

    (c) If your claim is for $100,000 or less and you do not advise the 
awarding official that you want a decision within 60 days, or if your 
claim exceeds $100,000 and the awarding official has notified you of the 
time within which a decision will be issued, the awarding official shall 
issue a decision within a reasonable time. What is ``reasonable'' 
depends upon the size and complexity of your claim, and upon the 
adequacy of the information you have given to the awarding official in 
support of your claim.


<R05>

Sec. 900.224   What happens if the decision does not come within that time?

    If the awarding official does not issue a decision within the time 
required under Sec. 900.223, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may 
treat the delay as though the awarding official has denied the claim, 
and proceed according to Sec. 900.222(e),


<R05>

Sec. 900.225   Does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get paid immediately if the awarding official decides in its favor?

    Yes. Once the awarding official decides that money should be paid 
under the contract, the amount due, minus any portion already paid, 
should be paid as promptly as possible, without waiting for either party 
to file an appeal. Any payment which is made under this subsection will 
not affect any other rights either party might have. In addition, it 
will not create a binding legal precedent as to any future payments.


<R05>

Sec. 900.226   What rules govern appeals of cost disallowances?

    In any appeal involving a disallowance of costs, the Board of 
Contract Appeals will give due consideration to the factual 
circumstances giving rise to the disallowed costs, and shall seek to 
determine a fair result without rigid adherence to strict accounting 
principles. The determination of allowability shall assure fair 
compensation for the work or service performed, using cost and 
accounting data as guides, but not rigid measures, for ascertaining fair 
compensation.


<R05>

Sec. 900.227   Can the awarding official change the decision after it has been made?

    (a) The decision of the awarding official is final and conclusive, 
and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal or government agency, 
unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced as authorized by the 
Contract Disputes Act. Once the decision has been made, the awarding 
official may not change it, except by agreement of the parties, or under 
the following limited circumstances:
    (1) If evidence is discovered which could not have been discovered 
through due diligence before the awarding official issued the decision;
    (2) If the awarding official learns that there has been fraud, 
misrepresentation, or other misconduct by a party;
    (3) If the decision is beyond the scope of the awarding official's 
authority;
    (4) If the claim has been satisfied, released or discharged; or
    (5) For any other reason justifying relief from the decision.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be interpreted to discourage 
settlement discussions or prevent settlement of the dispute at any time.
    (c) If a decision is withdrawn and a new decision is issued that is 
not acceptable to the contractor, the contractor may proceed with the 
appeal based on the new decision. If no new decision is issued, the 
contractor may proceed under Sec. 900.224.
    (d) If an appeal or suit is filed, the awarding official may modify 
or withdraw his or her final decision.


<R05>

Sec. 900.228   Is an Indian tribe or tribal organization entitled to interest if it wins its claim?

    Yes. If an Indian tribe or tribal organization wins the claim, it 
will be entitled to interest on the amount of the award. The interest 
will be calculated from the date the awarding official receives the 
claim until the day it is paid. The interest rate will be the rate which 
the Secretary of the Treasury sets for the Renegotiation Board under the 
Renegotiation Act of 1951, Public Law 92-41, 26 U.S.C. 1212 and 26 
U.S.C. 7447.

[[Page 883]]


<R05>

Sec. 900.229   What role will the awarding official play during an appeal?

    (a) The awarding official shall provide any data, documentation, 
information or support required by the IBCA for use in deciding a 
pending appeal.
    (b) Within 30 days of receiving an appeal or learning that an appeal 
has been filed, the awarding official shall assemble a file which 
contains all the documents which are pertinent to the appeal, including:
    (1) The decision and findings of fact from which the appeal is 
taken;
    (2) The contract, including specifications and pertinent 
modifications, plans and drawings;
    (3) All correspondence between the parties which relates to the 
appeal, including the letter or letters of claims in response to which 
the decision was issued;
    (4) Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of the 
proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter 
in dispute, which were made before the filing of the notice of appeal 
with the IBCA; and
    (5) Any additional information which may be relevant.


<R05>

Sec. 900.230  What is the effect of a pending appeal?

    (a) Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall continue 
performance of a contract during the appeal of any claims to the same 
extent they would had there been no dispute.
    (b) A pending dispute will not affect or bar the negotiation or 
award of any subsequent contract or negotiation between the parties.


<R04>
                    Subpart O--Conflicts of Interest


<R05>

Sec. 900.231  What is an organizational conflict of interest?

    An organizational conflict of interest arises when there is a direct 
conflict between the financial interests of the contracting Indian tribe 
or tribal organization and:
    (a) The financial interests of beneficial owners of Indian trust 
resources;
    (b) The financial interests of the United States relating to trust 
resources, trust acquisitions, or lands conveyed or to be conveyed 
pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.; or
    (c) An express statutory obligation of the United States to third 
parties. This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed 
when the contract was first negotiated. This section only applies where 
the financial interests of the Indian tribe or tribal organization are 
significant enough to impair the Indian tribe or tribal organization's 
objectivity in carrying out the contract, or a portion of the contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.232  What must an Indian tribe or tribal organization do if an organizational conflict of interest arises under a contract?

    This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the 
contract was first negotiated. When an Indian tribe or tribal 
organization becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest, 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization must immediately disclose the 
conflict to the Secretary.


<R05>

Sec. 900.233  When must an Indian tribe or tribal organization regulate its employees or subcontractors to avoid a personal conflict of interest?

    An Indian tribe or tribal organization must maintain written 
standards of conduct to govern officers, employees, and agents 
(including subcontractors) engaged in functions related to the 
management of trust assets.


<R05>

Sec. 900.234  What types of personal conflicts of interest involving tribal officers, employees or subcontractors would have to be regulated by an Indian tribe?

    The Indian tribe or tribal organization would need a tribally-
approved mechanism to ensure that no officer, employee, or agent 
(including a subcontractor) of the Indian tribe or tribal organization 
reviews a trust transaction in which that person has a financial or 
employment interest that conflicts with that of the trust beneficiary, 
whether the tribe or an allottee. Interests arising from membership in, 
or employment by, an Indian tribe or rights to share in a tribal claim 
need not be regulated.

[[Page 884]]


<R05>

Sec. 900.235  What personal conflicts of interest must the standards of conduct regulate?

    The standards must prohibit an officer, employee, or agent 
(including a subcontractor) from participating in the review, analysis, 
or inspection of trust transactions involving an entity in which such 
persons have a direct financial interest or an employment relationship. 
It must also prohibit such officers, employees, or agents from accepting 
any gratuity, favor, or anything of more than nominal value, from a 
party (other than the Indian tribe) with an interest in the trust 
transactions under review. Such standards must also provide for 
sanctions or remedies for violation of the standards.


<R05>

Sec. 900.236  May an Indian tribe elect to negotiate contract provisions on conflict of interest to take the place of this regulation?

    Yes. An Indian tribe and the Secretary may agree to contract 
provisions, concerning either personal or organizational conflicts, that 
address the issues specific to the program and activities contracted in 
a manner that provides equivalent protection against conflicts of 
interest to these regulations. Agreed-upon contract provisions shall be 
followed, rather than the related provisions of this regulation. For 
example, the Indian tribe and the Secretary may agree that using the 
Indian tribe's own written code of ethics satisfies the objectives of 
the personal conflicts provisions of this regulation, in whole or in 
part.


<R04>
           Subpart P--Retrocession and Reassumption Procedures


<R05>

Sec. 900.240  What does retrocession mean?

    A retrocession means the return to the Secretary of a contracted 
program, in whole or in part, for any reason, before the expiration of 
the term of the contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.241  Who may retrocede a contract, in whole or in part?

    An Indian tribe or tribal organization authorized by an Indian tribe 
may retrocede a contract.


<R05>

Sec. 900.242  What is the effective date of retrocession?

    The retrocession is effective on the date which is the earliest date 
among:
    (a) One year from the date of the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization's request;
    (b) The date the contract expires; or
    (c) A mutually agreed-upon date.


<R05>

Sec. 900.243  What effect will an Indian tribe or tribal organization's retrocession have on its rights to contract?

    An Indian tribe or tribal organization's retrocession shall not 
negatively affect:
    (a) Any other contract to which it is a party;
    (b) Any other contracts it may request; and
    (c) Any future request by the Indian tribe or tribal organization to

<R05>

Sec. 900.249  What happens if the contractor fails to take corrective action to remedy the contract deficiencies identified in the notice?

<R05>
Sec. 1001.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this rule is to establish the process for tribes to 
apply for entry into the Self-Governance program and to establish the 
selection criteria by which the Department will identify eligible tribes 
and select tribes to begin the negotiations process.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.2  Applicant eligibility.

    Any tribe or consortium of tribes seeking inclusion in the applicant 
pool must meet the following eligibility criteria:
    (a) Be a federally recognized tribe or a consortium of federally 
recognized tribes as defined in Public Law 93-638.
    (b) Document, with an official action of the tribal governing body, 
a formal request to enter negotiations with the Department of Interior 
(Department) under the Tribal Self-Governance Act authority. In the case 
of a consortium of tribes, the governing body of each participating 
tribe must authorize participation by an official action by the tribal 
governing body.
    (c) Demonstrate financial stability and financial management 
capability by furnishing organization-wide single audit reports as 
prescribed by Public Law 96-502, the Single Audit Act of 1984, for the 
previous three years. These audits must not contain material audit 
exceptions. In the case of tribal consortiums, each signatory to the 
agreement must meet this requirement. Non-signatory tribes participating 
in the consortium do not have to meet this requirement.
    (d) Successfully complete the planning phase for self-governance. A 
final planning report must be submitted which demonstrates that the 
tribe has conducted--
    (1) Legal and budgetary research; and
    (2) Internal tribal government and organizational planning.
    (e) To be included in the applicant pool, tribes or tribal 
consortiums may submit their applications at any time. The application 
should state which year the tribe desires to enter negotiations.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.3  Priority ranking for negotiations.

    In addition to the eligibility criteria identified above, a tribe or 
consortium of tribes seeking priority ranking for negotiations must 
submit a description of the efforts of the tribe or consortium to seek 
to enter negotiations and/or prepare for operations under the self-
governance option. This narrative should identify any activities that 
the tribe has pursued, carefully identifying and documenting the dates 
involved, including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) Prior planning activities related to self-governance, noting the 
source of funding for the planning activity and whether or not it was 
sanctioned by the Office of Self-Governance (OSG), including 
documentation as applicable.
    (b) Prior efforts to secure planning and/or negotiation grants.
    (c) Meetings with the OSG or other Departmental offices in which the 
tribe expressed an interest in participating in the Self-Governance 
Project.
    (d) Correspondence between the tribe and the Department in which the 
tribe has expressed an interest in participating in the Self-Governance 
Project.
    (e) All actions of the tribal governing body related to 
participating in the self-governance option.

[[Page 889]]


<R05>
Sec. 1001.4  Application review and approval.

    Upon receipt of an application, the OSG will review the package and 
determine whether or not it is complete. Upon determination that it is 
complete, the name of the tribe or consortium will be included in the 
official applicant pool. Incomplete submissions will be returned with 
the deficiencies identified. Revised applications may be resubmitted for 
consideration at any time.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.5  Application review and selection process for negotiations for funding agreements.

    Upon acceptance into the applicant pool, the OSG will assign to each 
tribe or consortium a ranking relative to other applicants based upon 
the date the OSG receives the complete application package. This ranking 
will constitute a master list that will be maintained and updated on a 
continuous basis from year to year. When receipt dates are the same for 
two or more applications, several other factors will be considered in 
determining the placement of the tribe or consortium on the list. These 
factors are identified in priority order as follows:
    (a) Designation by the Congress through report language that a tribe 
should be considered for participation. These designations will be 
considered based upon the actual language of the report.
    (b) Documentation of OSG sanctioning of the tribe's self-governance 
planning and subsequent evidence of actual planning by the tribe.
    (c) Submission of a completed planning or negotiation grant 
application in the previous year.
    (d) A signed agreement pursuant to the Indian Health Service (IHS) 
self-governance project.
    (e) Receipt of a planning grant awarded by the IHS.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.6  Submitting applications.

    (a) Applications for inclusion in the applicant pool will be 
accepted on an on-going basis.
    (b) Applications may be mailed or hand-delivered.
    (c) Applications for negotiations in 1996 that are mailed must be 
postmarked no later than May 16, 1995.
    (d) Applications must be sent to: Director, Office of Self 
Governance, Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., MIB RM/MS-
2548, Washington, DC 20240.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.7  Availability, amount, and number of planning and negotiation grants.

    (a) What is the purpose of this section? This section describes how 
to apply for planning and negotiation grants authorized by section 
402(d) of the Act to help meet tribal costs incurred:
    (1) In meeting the planning phase requirement of Pub. L. 103-413, 
including planning to negotiate non-BIA programs, services, functions 
and activities; and
    (2) In conducting negotiations.
    (b) What types of grants are available? Three categories of grants 
may be available:
    (1) Negotiation grants for tribes/consortia selected from the 
applicant pool as described in Sec. 1001.5 of these regulations;
    (2) Planning grants for tribes/consortia requiring advance funding 
to meet the planning phase requirement of Pub. L. 103-413; and
    (3) Financial assistance for tribes/consortia to plan for 
negotiating for non-BIA programs, services, functions and activities, as 
described in Sec. 1001.10.
    (c) Will grants always be made available to meet the planning phase 
requirement as described in section 402(d) of Pub. L. 103-413? No. 
Grants to cover some or all of the planning costs that a tribe/
consortium may incur may be made available depending upon the 
availability of funds appropriated by Congress. We will publish notice 
of availability of grants in the Federal Register as described in this 
section.
    (d) May a tribe use its own resources to meet its planning and 
negotiation expenses in preparation for entering into self-governance? 
Yes. A tribe/consortium may use its own resources to meet these costs. 
Receiving a grant is not necessary to meet the planning

[[Page 890]]

phase requirement of the Act or to negotiate a compact and annual 
funding agreement.
    (e) What happens if there are insufficient funds to meet the 
anticipated tribal requests for planning and negotiation grants in any 
given year? If appropriated funds are available but insufficient to meet 
the total requests from tribes/consortia, we will give first priority to 
those that have been selected from the applicant pool to negotiate an 
annual funding agreement. We will give second priority to tribes/
consortia that require advance funds to meet the planning requirement 
for entry into the self-governance program. We will give third priority 
to tribes/consortia that require negotiation/planning funds to negotiate 
for DOI non-BIA programs.
    (f) How many grants will the Department make each year and what 
funding will be available? The number and size of grants awarded each 
year will depend on Congressional appropriations and tribal interest. 
Each year, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register which 
provides relevant details about the application process, including: The 
funds available, timeframes, and requirements for negotiation and 
advance planning specified in this part.

[61 FR 17831, Apr. 23, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1001.8  Selection criteria for tribes/consortia to receive a negotiation grant.

    (a) Who may be selected to receive a negotiation grant? Any tribe/
consortium that has been accepted into the applicant pool in accordance 
with Sec. 1001.5 and has been selected to negotiate a self-governance 
annual funding agreement is eligible to apply for a negotiation grant. 
Each year, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register with all 
relevant details as to how tribes/consortia which have been selected can 
apply for negotiation grants.
    (b) What must a tribe/consortium do to receive a negotiation grant?
    (1) To receive a negotiation grant, a tribe/consortium must:
    (i) Be selected from the applicant pool to negotiate an annual 
funding agreement;
    (ii) Be identified as eligible to receive a negotiation grant; and
    (iii) Not have received a negotiation grant within the 3 years 
preceding the date of the latest Federal Register announcement described 
in Sec. 1001.7.
    (2) The tribe/consortium must submit a letter affirming its 
readiness to negotiate and formally request a negotiation grant to 
prepare for and negotiate a self-governance agreement. These grants are 
not competitive.
    (c) May a selected tribe negotiate without applying for a 
negotiation grant? Yes. In this case, the tribe should notify us in 
writing so that funds can be reallocated for other grants.

[61 FR 17832, Apr. 23, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1001.9  Selection criteria for tribes/consortia seeking advance planning grant funding.

    (a) Who is eligible to apply for a planning grant that will be 
awarded before a tribe/consortium is admitted into the applicant pool? 
Any tribe/consortium that is not a self-governance tribe and needs 
advance funding in order to complete the planning phase requirement may 
apply. Tribes/consortia that have received a planning grant within 3 
years preceding the date of the latest Federal Register announcement 
described in Sec. 1001.7 are not eligible.
    (b) What must a tribe/consortium seeking a planning grant submit in 
order to meet the planning phase requirements? A tribe/consortium must 
submit the following material:
    (1) A tribal resolution or other final action of the tribal 
governing body indicating a desire to plan for tribal self-governance;
    (2) Audits from the last 3 years which document that the tribe meets 
the requirement of being free from any material audit exception;
    (3) A proposal that describes the tribe's/consortium's plans to 
conduct:
    (i) Legal and budgetary research, and
    (ii) Internal tribal government and organization planning;
    (4) A timeline indicating when planning will start and end; and
    (5) Evidence that the tribe/consortium can perform the tasks 
associated with its proposal (i.e., submit resumes

[[Page 891]]

and position descriptions of key staff or consultants to be used).
    (c) How will tribes/consortia know when and how to apply for 
planning grants? Each year, we will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice of the availability of planning grants for additional tribes as 
described in Sec. 1001.7. This notice will identify the specific details 
for applying.
    (d) What criteria will be used to award planning grants to those 
tribes/consortia requiring advance funding to meet the planning phase 
requirement of Public Law 103-413? Advance planning grants are 
discretionary and based on need. The following criteria will be used to 
determine whether to award a planning grant to a tribe/consortium before 
the tribe is being selected into the applicant pool:
    (1) A complete application as described in Secs. 1001.9(b) and 
1001.9(c);
    (2) A demonstration of financial need. We will rank applications 
according to the percentage of tribal resources to total resources as 
indicated in the latest A-128 audit. We will give priority to 
applications that demonstrate financial need by having a lower level of 
tribal resources as a percent of total resources; and
    (3) Other factors that demonstrate the readiness of the tribe/
consortium to enter into a self-governance agreement, including previous 
efforts of the tribe/consortium to participate in self-governance.
    (e) Can tribes/consortia that receive advance planning grants also 
apply for a negotiation grant? Yes. Tribes/consortia that receive 
advance planning grants may submit a completed application to be 
included in the applicant pool. Once approved for inclusion in the 
applicant pool, the tribe/consortium may apply for a negotiation grant 
according to the process identified in Sec. 1001.7 above.
    (f) When and how will a tribe/consortium know whether it has been 
selected to receive an advance planning grant? Within 30 days of the 
deadline for submitting applications we will notify the tribe/consortium 
by letter whether it has been selected to receive an advance planning 
grant.

<R05>
Sec. 1001.10  Selection criteria for other planning and negotiating financial assistance.

    (a) What is the purpose of this section? This section describes how 
to apply for other financial assistance for planning and negotiating of 
a DOI non-BIA program, service, function or activity that may be 
available, as well as the selection process.
    (b) Are there other funds that may be available to self-governance 
tribes/consortia for planning and negotiating with DOI non-BIA bureaus? 
Yes. Tribes/consortia may contact the Director, Office of Self-
Governance to determine if funds are available for the purpose of 
planning and negotiating with DOI non-BIA bureaus under this section. A 
tribe/consortium may also request information from a DOI non-BIA bureau 
on any funds which may be available from that bureau.
    (c) Who is eligible to apply for financial assistance to plan and 
negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program? Any existing self-governance tribe/
consortium is eligible.
    (d) Under what circumstances may planning and negotiation financial 
assistance be made available to tribes/consortia? At the discretion of 
the Director, grants may be awarded when requested by the tribe and 
coordinated with the DOI non-BIA agency involved.
    (e) How does the tribe/consortium apply for a grant to plan and 
negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program? When such funds are available, we 
will publish a notice of their availability and a deadline for 
submitting applications for such grants in the Federal Register as 
indicated in Sec. 1001.7.
    (f) What must be included in the application? The application must 
include the following:
    (1) The tribal resolution or other final action of the tribal 
governing body indicating that the tribe/consortium intends to negotiate 
for a DOI non-BIA program;
    (2) A copy of the proposal or summary that was submitted to the DOI 
non-BIA bureau;
    (3) A time line indicating when planning will begin and end;
    (4) The planning resources from all other sources that are approved 
and/or

[[Page 892]]

anticipated for the planning activity; and
    (5) The amount requested and a justification of why it is needed by 
the tribe/consortium.
    (g) What criteria will we use to award grants to those tribes/
consortia requesting financial assistance to plan and negotiate for a 
DOI non-BIA program? The award of such grants is discretionary. After 
consulting with the requesting tribe/consortium and the appropriate DOI 
non-BIA bureau, the Director will determine whether to award a grant to 
plan and negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program. The determination will be 
based upon the complexity of the project, the availability of resources 
from all other sources, and the relative need of the tribe/consortium to 
receive such funds for the successful completion of the planning and 
negotiating activity, as determined by the percentage of tribal 
resources to total resources as indicated in the latest A-128 audit. All 
decisions to award or not to award grants as described in paragraphs (e) 
and (f) of this section are final for the Department.

    General Counsel means the attorney for the tribe.
    OST means the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, 
Department of the Interior.
    OTFM means the Office of Trust Funds Management, Department of the 
Interior.
    Resolution means the formal manner in which a tribal government

[[Page 896]]

    Solicitor means the Office of the Solicitor, Department of the 
Interior.
    Special Trustee means the Special Trustee for American Indians 
appointed under Title III of the Act.
    Tribal council means the elected or appointed governing officials of 
any tribe which is recognized by the Secretary.
    Tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nation, rancheria, pueblo, 
colony or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or 
village corporation as defined or established pursuant to the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act which is federally recognized by the U.S. 
Government for special programs and services provided by the Secretary 
to Indians because of their status as Indians. For this purpose, it also 
means two or more tribes joined for any purpose, the joint assets of 
which include funds held in trust by the Secretary. An example of this 
would be the KCA (consisting of the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Tribes).
    Us means the Department of the Interior, i.e., the Secretary of the

<R05>
Sec. 1200.3  What is the Department's policy on tribal management of trust funds?

    (a) We will give tribes as much responsibility as they desire for 
the management of their tribal funds that we currently hold in trust.
    (b) Title II of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform 
Act, implemented by these regulations, offers tribes one approach for 
assuming increased management of their funds that we now hold in trust 
and administer. Under Title II, a tribe may completely remove its funds 
from Federal trust status and manage them as it wishes, subject to the 
requirements and conditions in this part. When a tribe withdraws its 
funds under this part, it may invest those funds in equities or other 
investment vehicles that are statutorily unavailable to us.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.4  May tribes exercise increased direction over their trust funds and retain the protections of Federal trust status?

    Yes. The Tribal Self-Governance Act (25 U.S.C. 458) and the Indian 
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) 
provide other options for trust funds management. A tribe may choose to 
manage its trust funds under the provisions of these Acts if it wishes. 
These options are covered by 25 CFR part 900 (the ``Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act Program'') and 25 CFR part 
1000 (the ``Self-Governance Program'').


<R05>
Sec. 1200.5  What are the advantages and disadvantages of managing trust funds under the options in Sec. 1200.4?

    Under these other options, the funds remain in Federal trust status 
and the tribe can exercise a range of control over their management. 
However, the tribe has fewer investment options than it has when it 
withdraws its funds completely from trust status. If a tribe chooses to 
keep its funds in trust status, the tribe is subject to the same 
statutory investment restrictions that bind us. That means that the 
tribe's investments are limited to bank deposits and securities 
guaranteed by the United States. (See 25 U.S.C. 162a for specific 
statutory investment restrictions.)


<R05>
Sec. 1200.6  Do these regulations tell tribes how to receive future income directly rather than have the government continue to collect it?

    No. These regulations apply only to the withdrawal of funds which 
are in trust. Some of these funds come from the sale or lease of trust 
resources. Even if a tribe withdraws its funds, we will collect and 
manage future income. If a tribe wishes to receive future income 
directly, it should contact the OST/OTFM staff at its agency or area 
office to find out how to do this.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.7  Information collection.

    The information collection requirements contained in subpart B of 
this part, Application to Withdraw Tribal Funds from Trust Status and 
subpart D

[[Page 897]]

of this part, Application to Withdraw Tribal Funds from Trust Status-
General and Specific Budget Technical Assistance, have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq. and 
assigned clearance numbers 1035-001 (subpart B), and 1035-002 and 1035-
003 (subpart D). Information collected in Sec. 1200.13 (How does a tribe 
apply to withdraw funds?) will be used to determine the eligibility of 
applicants, and the capability of tribes or their contractors to manage 
and invest large blocks of funds. Information collected in Sec. 1200.43, 
(How can a tribe apply for technical assistance?) will be used to 
determine the eligibility of applicants, as well as the level of need 
for technical assistance, in order for tribes to develop Management 
Plans and to complete the application for withdrawal process.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Withdrawing Tribal Funds From Trust


<R05>
Sec. 1200.10  Who is eligible to withdraw their tribal funds from trust?

    Any tribe for whom we manage funds in trust.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.11  What funds may be withdrawn?

    A tribe may withdraw some or all funds that we hold in trust if we 
approve a plan that it submits under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.12  What limitations and restrictions apply to withdrawn funds?

    (a) A tribe may withdraw funds appropriated to satisfy judgments of 
the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) and the Court of Federal Claims and 
that we hold under the Indian Judgment Funds Use and Distributions Act 
(25 U.S.C. 1401) or another act of Congress if:
    (1) The tribe uses the funds as specified in the previously approved 
judgment fund plan, and;
    (2) The tribe withdraws only funds held for Indian tribes and does 
not include any funds held for individual tribal members.
    (b) A tribe may withdraw funds appropriated to satisfy settlement 
agreements relating to certain tribal claims and that we hold and manage 
for the tribe pursuant to an act of Congress if:
    (1) The tribe uses the funds as specified in the previously approved 
settlement act plan;
    (2) The tribe withdraws only funds held for Indian tribes and does 
not include any funds held for individual tribal members; and
    (3) It is determined that there is no provision in the act or 
settlement agreement requiring that the funds remain in trust to 
implement the act or agreement that cannot be waived.
    (c) Tribal funds commonly known as ``Proceeds of Labor'' funds, 
usually income to trust resources, are generally withdrawn under normal 
tribal budgeting procedures, but may also be withdrawn from trust under 
this part. These funds may be returned to trust under the provisions of 
subpart C of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.13  How does a tribe apply to withdraw funds?

    The tribe must submit four copies of its application and the 
attachments listed below to: Director, Office of Trust Funds Management, 
Department of the Interior, 505 Marquette NW, Suite 1000, Albuquerque, 
NM 87102. We will notify the tribe if the application is incomplete and 
will help the tribe complete the application if requested. When we 
determine that the application is complete, we will send copies to the 
appropriate agency superintendent and area director, the Special Trustee 
and the Solicitor. Each application package must contain the items 
listed below.
    (a) Proof that the tribe has notified its members of its intent to 
remove funds from trust and that, when the request is approved, the 
tribe and not the United States Government will be liable for funds 
management. Notification must be by the method(s) that the tribe 
customarily uses to notify its members of significant tribal actions. 
The notification must identify the specific funds to be withdrawn.
    (b) A tribal resolution that:
    (1) Expressly authorizes the withdrawal of the funds and indicates 
the (approximate) dollar amount of the funds to be withdrawn;

[[Page 898]]

    (2) Expressly acknowledges that the funds, once withdrawn in 
accordance with the Act, will no longer be held in trust status by the 
United States, and that we have no further liability or responsibility 
for the funds; and
    (3) Acknowledges that:
    (i) Neither we nor the tribe necessarily accept the account balances 
at the time of withdrawal as accurate; and
    (ii) Neither we nor the tribe have waived any rights regarding the 
balances, including the right to seek compensation for incorrect 
balances.
    (c) A copy of a formal agreement between the tribe and the manager 
of the funds to be withdrawn, in which the manager agrees to:
    (1) Comply with the terms of the plan we approve under Sec. 1200.15 
and make only those changes that conform to revision procedures in the 
approved plan and the requirements of Sec. 1200.19; and
    (2) Transfer funds to the tribe or another manager only after 
receiving a valid tribal resolution calling for this transfer and proof 
that the tribe has notified its members of intent to transfer the funds. 
The resolution must clearly state that:
    (i) The funds are being withdrawn to be reinvested by the tribe in a 
manner consistent with the goals and strategies of the approved plan; 
and
    (ii) The fund managers will continue to follow any previously 
approved distribution plan conditions.
    (d) A legal opinion by the tribe's attorney or its general counsel 
that:
    (1) The resolution referred to in paragraph (b) of this section was 
enacted under procedures established by the tribe's organic documents or 
oral tradition;
    (2) The tribal governing body has the legal authority to withdraw 
funds from trust status and that the withdrawal does not require a 
referendum vote or other procedure beyond a tribal council resolution; 
and
    (3) If the funds to be withdrawn are judgment or settlement funds, 
that the tribe's plan for managing the funds meets the requirements of 
any applicable judgment fund use and distribution plan or settlement 
act.
    (e) The results of a tribal referendum, if one was held.
    (f) If the funds to be withdrawn are judgment or settlement funds, a 
copy of the act and/or plan that sets out the conditions for the uses of 
the funds or income from them.
    (g) A management plan as provided for in Sec. 1200.14.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.14  What must the Tribal Management Plan contain?

    The Tribal Management Plan required by Sec. 1200.13 must include 
each of the following:
    (a) Tribal investment goals and the strategy for achieving them.
    (b) A description of the protection against the substantial loss of 
principal, as set forth in Sec. 1200.16.
    (c) A copy of the tribe's ordinances and procedures for managing or 
overseeing the management of the funds to be withdrawn. These must 
include adequate protections against fraud, abuse, and violations of the 
management plan.
    (d) A description of the tribe's previous experience managing or 
overseeing the management of invested funds. This should include factual 
data of past performance of tribally-managed funds (i.e., audited 
reports) and the identity and qualifications of the tribe's investment 
officer.
    (e) A description of the capability of all of the individuals or 
investment institutions that will be involved in managing and investing 
the funds for the tribe. Provide copies of State or Federal security

    (iv) Performance statistics on managed accounts for the past 5 
years; and
    (v) Any adverse actions by licensing and/or regulatory bodies within 
the past 5 years.
    (2) In addition, we may ask about:

for example, would be the positions having this authority.
    (i) A plan for custodianship of investment securities that includes:
    (1) Name of persons in the tribe who can direct the custodian;
    (2) Name of the custodian;
    (3) Copy of intended custodian agreement;
    (4) Size of custodian operation;
    (5) Disclosure of any security lending provisions; and
    (6) Insurance coverage.

agreement must include:
    (1) A statement that the copy to the Special Trustee is for 
information only, and infers no liability on our part regarding the 
audit results, nor does it infer a requirement for us to take any action 
whatsoever; and
    (2) A description of the steps (including audit performance and 
reporting) the tribe will take to ensure its membership that the tribe

of the Act.
    (k) The proposed date for transfer of funds.
    (l) A statement as to whether the tribe chooses to receive the 
withdrawal as a cash balance transfer, as a transfer of marketable 
investments that we own for the tribe, or as a combination of the two.
    (1) A cash balance transfer may require us to sell bonds, notes, or 
other investments that we purchased when investing the tribe's monies.
    (2) We cannot transfer non-marketable securities to a tribe. We can 
only purchase and hold them and must sell them back to the U.S. 
Treasury.
    (3) If we sell a tribe's security at a loss (i.e., when market value 
is less than book value or carrying value) we will first notify the 
tribe. The tribe must instruct us to proceed with the sale and must 
agree not to hold us responsible for the loss before we will make the 
sale.
    (4) If the tribe asks us to transfer marketable securities, upon 
proper instructions from the new tribal custodian, we will order our 
custodian to physically transfer the proper security to the new 
custodian on the agreed upon date.

<R05>
Sec. 1200.15  What is the approval process for management plans?

    The Secretary will approve or disapprove each management plan, based 
in part upon our recommendation.
    (a) We will determine the completeness of the application, provide 
for adequate professional review of the application and the management 
plan, and provide technical assistance as necessary to make an 
application complete.
    (b) We will coordinate with area directors in confirming authority 
of tribal governments to make requests.
    (c) We will approve or disapprove a request within 90 calendar days 
of receiving a completed application. This 90-day period does not 
include time that we spend awaiting a response from the tribe for 
additional information that we have requested. All determinations will 
be in writing, and all responses will be by certified mail.
    (d) If we find that a plan does not meet the criteria in 
Sec. 1200.16, we will notify the tribe of shortcomings of the request, 
and allow the tribe to respond

[[Page 900]]

before recommending formal disapproval.
    (e) Before final approval, we will reach agreement with the tribe on 
how many days after final approval we will transfer the funds. We will 
transfer the funds as soon after final approval as the tribe or manager 
is ready to receive them, unless we need additional time to sell 
existing instruments.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.16  What criteria will be used in evaluating the management plan?

    Each plan must be approved by the appropriate tribal governing body, 
and must be accompanied by a resolution approving the plan. The plan 
must be reasonable in light of the trust responsibility and the 
principles of Indian self-determination, and other appropriate factors, 
including, but not limited to, the factors listed below:
    (a) We will evaluate the individuals or entities that will manage 
the funds to be withdrawn, or that will advise the tribe on investing 
the funds to be withdrawn in order to determine if they have the 
capability and experience to manage the funds. Among the elements we 
will evaluate are: the number of years in business, the performance 
record for funds management, and the ability to compensate the tribe if 
the entity is found liable for failing to comply with the tribe's 
management plan (i.e., its assets, bonding, and insurance).
    (b) We will review the tribe's experience in managing investments. 
We will compare this experience to the complexity of the proposed 
management plan to determine whether the tribe has the experience to 
manage its proposed plan or whether it should begin with a less complex 
approach.
    (c) We will evaluate the tribe's internal audit and control systems 
for overseeing or monitoring its investment activity.
    (d) We will evaluate the adequacy of protection against substantial 
loss of principal. Our determination will include a thorough evaluation 
of the tribe's investment plan including:
    (1) The goals and objectives;
    (2) The proposed uses of the fund in order to meet business 
objectives;
    (3) The size and diversity of the investment portfolio (for example, 
the class of stocks and the mixture of types of investments);
    (4) The financial condition of the tribe;
    (5) The inherent riskiness of the proposed investments; and
    (6) The tribe's projected need and proposed timeframes to draw down 
the funds being invested or the income from them.
    (e) We will determine the likelihood that the plan will be followed. 
We will base this determination on the contents of the agreement between 
the tribe and the fund manager and other appropriate factors.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.17  What special criteria will be used to evaluate management plans for judgment or settlement funds?

    For judgment or settlement funds, in addition to the criteria in 
Sec. 1200.16, we will determine if the plan adequately provides for 
compliance with any conditions, uses of funds, or other requirements 
established by the appropriate judgment fund plan or settlement act.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.18  When does the Department's trust responsibility end?

    Our trust responsibility for funds withdrawn under this part ends on 
the date that the funds are withdrawn. However at the time of withdrawal 
neither we nor the tribe may be deemed to have accepted the account 
balance at the time of withdrawal as accurate; or waived any rights 
regarding the balance and our ability to seek compensation.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.19  How can the plan be revised?

    Once a tribe has withdrawn its funds, the tribe may revise its plan 
without our approval. All revisions should conform to the procedures 
outlined in the approved management plan. The tribe should inform its 
members of all revisions to a plan through normal tribal procedures 
before the revisions are implemented.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.20  How can a tribe withdraw additional funds?

    (a) If a tribe has withdrawn funds under an approved tribal 
management plan and wishes to withdraw additional funds that will be 
managed under the

[[Page 901]]

same plan, it need not submit a complete new application. The tribe 
must:
    (1) Notify us of the additional amount it intends to withdraw and 
whether the funds to be withdrawn are in kind or cash. (Written 
notification should be provided to our address in Sec. 1200.13);
    (2) Send us a tribal resolution approving the new withdrawal and 
certifying that the funds are being withdrawn subject to the same 
conditions and that they will be managed under the plan in the original 
approved application;
    (3) Send us a copy of the most recent compliance audit or investment 
report.
    (b) After we finish our review we will release the additional funds, 
unless the compliance audit or investment report indicates that the 
tribe is not complying with its management plan. In this case, we will 
not release the additional funds until the tribe demonstrates that it is 
complying with the management plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.21  How may a tribe appeal denials under this part?

    If we deny a request or do not approve an application within 90 days 
of a request, the tribe may address any problems that we identify and 
resubmit a revised request, seek technical assistance, or appeal the 
denial under 43 CFR part 4.


<R04>
               Subpart C--Returning Tribal Funds to Trust


<R05>
Sec. 1200.30  How does a tribe notify the Department if it wishes to return withdrawn funds to Federal trust status?

    If a tribe elects to return some or all of the funds it has 
withdrawn from Federal trust status pursuant to this Act, it must first 
notify us in writing at our address in Sec. 1200.13. This notification 
must provide a proposed date for the return of the funds, as well as the 
amount of funds to be returned, or actual securities to be delivered to 
the appropriate custodian.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.31  What part of withdrawn funds can be returned to trust?

    A tribe may return all or a portion of the principal which was 
removed from trust under this Act along with earnings and profits. We 
will verify the amount declared for earnings before we accept a return. 
We will accept any amount less than the original principal amount as a 
principal amount.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.32  How often can funds be returned?

    Tribes may return all or part of withdrawn funds no more than twice 
a year, beginning no sooner than six months after date of withdrawal, 
except with approval of the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.33  How can funds be returned?

    Funds may be returned either as cash or securities, which meet the 
requirements for investments in 25 U.S.C. 162a. Cash can be transferred 
to the US Treasury by Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT), or the Automated 
Clearing House (ACH) process. Tribes must coordinate the transfer of 
ownership in securities with us to ensure proper credit to the tribe. 
The securities must meet investment restrictions contained in 25 U.S.C. 
162a.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.34  Can a tribe withdraw redeposited funds?

    Yes. If a tribe wishes to withdraw redeposited funds from Federal 
trust status, it must submit a written request to do so, accompanied by 
a new resolution and any revisions it wishes to make in its original 
management plan.


<R04>
                     Subpart D--Technical Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 1200.40  How will the Department provide technical assistance for tribes?

    (a) We will provide direct or contract technical assistance, in 
accordance with appropriations availability to tribes for developing, 
implementing, and managing Indian trust fund investment plans. We will 
ensure that our legal, financial and other expertise is made fully 
available to advise tribes in developing, implementing, and managing 
investment plans.
    (b) We may award grants to tribes for developing and implementing 
plans for investing Indian tribal trust funds.
    (c) Tribes may also obtain technical assistance on their own.

[[Page 902]]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.41  What types of technical assistance are available?

    The types of technical assistance include: investment planning; 
accounting; selection of investment managers; monitoring of investments; 
asset management; or other assistance appropriate to support funds 
withdrawal.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.42  Who can provide technical assistance?

    A sample of competent providers includes any of the following 
entities with the appropriate skills and capabilities: available DOI or 
OST staff; intertribal organizations; public agencies; and contracted 
private investment firms.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.43  How can a tribe apply for technical assistance?

    (a) Tribes wishing technical assistance may request it by sending us 
a letter along with a tribal resolution outlining the technical 
assistance required, tribal resources which may be applied to the need, 
and suggested provider, if known. The resolution must state clearly that 
the assistance is needed for developing, implementing, or managing an 
investment plan under the provisions of this authority.
    (b) Tribes requesting funds for technical assistance must send a 
completed SF-424, APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE, and SF-424A, 
BUDGET INFORMATION, along with a tribal resolution, detailing the 
assistance specifically requested, and the suggested provider to our 
address in Sec. 1200.13.
    (c) We will make grants subject to funds availability. We will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register concerning the availability of 
funding, deadlines for grants, the application process, and approval 
criteria. If funding is limited, grants will be awarded based on 
criteria that we feel will best meet the intent of the Act. We will 
consult with tribes in determining annual criteria. Unsolicited grant 
requests will not be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.44  What action will the Department take on requests for technical assistance?

    We will respond in writing to all requests for technical assistance 
and grants, advising of decision, availability of appropriate expertise 
and funding, and anticipated delivery of the service.
