                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 1200.3  Proposals.

    (a) An order may be proposed by any organization certified pursuant 
to the Act or any interested person affected by the Act, including the 
Secretary. Any person or organization other than the Secretary proposing 
an order shall file with the Administrator a written application, 
together with a copy of the proposal, requesting the Secretary to hold a 
hearing upon the proposal. Upon receipt of such proposal, the 
Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made and such 
consideration to be given as, in the Administrator's opinion, are 
warranted. If the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator 
to conclude that the proposed order will not tend to effectuate the 
declared policy of the Act, or that for other proper reasons a hearing 
should not be held on the proposal, the Administrator shall deny the 
application, and promptly notify the applicant of such denial, which 
notice shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds for the 
denial.
    (b) If the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator to

provided herein.

    (a) Filing and contents of the notice of hearing. The proceeding 
shall be instituted by filing the notice of hearing with the hearing 
clerk. The notice of hearing shall contain a reference to the authority 
under which the order is proposed; shall define the scope of the hearing 
as specifically as may be practicable; shall contain either the terms or 
substance of the proposed order or a description of the subjects and 
issues involved; and shall state the time and place of such hearing, and 
the place where copies of such proposed order may be obtained or 
examined. The time of the hearing shall not be less than 15 days after 
the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register, as 
provided herein, unless the Administrator shall determine that an 
emergency exists which requires a shorter period of notice, in which 
case the period of notice shall be that which the Administrator may 
determine to be reasonable in the circumstances: Except that in the case 
of hearings on amendments to an order, the time of the hearing may be 
less than 15 days but shall not be less than three days after the date 
of publication in the Federal Register.
    (b) Giving notice of hearing and supplemental publicity. (1) The 
Administrator shall give or cause to be given notice of hearing in the 
following manner:

known by the Administrator to be interested therein;
    (iii) By issuing a press release containing the complete text or a 
summary of the contents of the notice of hearing and making the same 
available to such newspapers as, in the Administrator's discretion, are 
best calculated to bring the notice to the attention of the persons 
interested therein; and
    (iv) By forwarding copies of the notice of hearing addressed to 
those Governors of the States and executive heads of territories and 
possessions of the United States and the mayor of the District of 
Columbia that are directly affected by such order.
    (2) Legal notice of the hearing shall be deemed to be given if 
notice is given in the manner provided by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section; failure to give notice in the manner provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not affect the 
legality of the notice.
    (c) Record of notice and supplemental publicity. There shall be 
filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing an 
affidavit or certificate of the person giving the notice provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section. In regard to the

[[Page 9]]

provisions relating to mailing in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, 
determination by the Administrator that such provisions have been 
complied with shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the 
judge at the hearing. In the alternative, if notice is not given in the 
manner provided in paragraphs (b)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section there shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the 
judge at the hearing a determination by the Administrator that such 
notice is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest 
with a brief statement of the reasons for such determination. 
Determinations by the Administrator as herein provided shall be final.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.6  Docket number.

    Each proceeding, immediately following its institution, shall be 
assigned a docket number by the hearing clerk and thereafter the 
proceeding may be referred to by such number.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.7  Judge.

    (a) Assignment. No judge who has any pecuniary interest in the 
outcome of a proceeding shall serve as judge in such proceeding.
    (b) Power of judge. Subject to review by the Secretary, as provided 
elsewhere in this subpart, the judge in any proceeding shall have power 
to:
    (1) Rule upon motions and requests;
    (2) Change the time and place of hearings, and adjourn the hearing 
from time to time or from place to place;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;
    (4) Examine and cross-examine witnesses and receive evidence;
    (5) Admit or exclude evidence;
    (6) Hear oral argument on facts or law; and
    (7) Do all acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance 
of order at the hearings and the efficient conduct of the proceeding.
    (c) Who may act in absence of judge. In case of the absence of the 
judge or the judge's inability to act, the powers and duties to be 
performed by the judge under this part in connection with a proceeding 
may, without abatement of the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the 
Secretary, be assigned to any other judge.
    (d) Disqualification of judge. The judge may at any time withdraw as 
judge in a proceeding if such judge deems himself or herself to be 
disqualified. Upon the filing by an interested person in good faith of a 
timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of 
a judge, the Secretary shall determine the matter as a part of the 
record and decision in the proceeding, after making such investigation 
or holding such hearings, or both, as the Secretary may deem appropriate 
in the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.8  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. (1) All motions and requests shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during the course of the hearing 
may be filed with the judge or may be stated orally and made a part of 
the transcript.
    (2) Except as provided in Sec. 1200.17(b) such motions and requests 
shall be addressed to, and ruled on by, the judge if made prior to 
certification of the transcript pursuant to Sec. 1200.11 or by the 
Secretary if made thereafter.
    (b) Certification to Secretary. The judge may, in his or her 
discretion, submit or certify to the Secretary for decision any motion, 
request, objection, or other question addressed to the judge.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.9  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) Time and place. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
fixed in the notice of hearing, unless the judge shall have changed the 
time or place, in which event the judge shall file with the hearing 
clerk a notice of such change, which notice shall be given in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 1200.5 (relating to the giving of notice of 
the hearing): Except that if the change in time or place of hearing is 
made less than five days prior to the date previously fixed for the 
hearing, the judge either in addition to or in lieu of causing the 
notice of the change to be given, shall announce, or cause to be 
announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed for the 
hearing.
    (b) Appearances--(1) Right to appear. At the hearing, any interested 
person

[[Page 10]]

shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in person or through 
authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with respect to 
matters relevant and material to the proceeding. Any interested person 
who desires to be heard in person at any hearing under these rules 
shall, before proceeding to testify, state his or her name, address, and 
occupation. If any such person is appearing through a counsel or 
representative, such person or such counsel or representative shall, 
before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the hearing, 
state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or 
representative, and the names, addresses, and occupations of such person 
and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such counsel or 
representative shall give such other information respecting such 
appearance as the judge may request.
    (2) Debarment of counsel or representative. (i) Whenever, while a 
proceeding is pending before the judge, such judge finds that a person, 
acting as counsel or representative for any person participating in the 
proceeding, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge 
may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel 
or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be 
taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or 
suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Except that the judge may 
suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling 
the client to obtain other counsel or representative.
    (ii) In case the judge has ordered that a person be precluded from 
further action as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the judge 
within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the Secretary a 
report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order and shall 
recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other 
proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after 
notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings 
before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
    (3) Failure to appear. If any interested person fails to appear at 
the hearing, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to be 
heard in the proceeding.
    (c) Order of procedure. (1) The judge shall, at the opening of the 
hearing prior to the taking of testimony, have noted as part of the 
record the notice of hearing as filed with the Office of the Federal 
Register and the affidavit or certificate of the giving of notice or the 
determination provided for in Sec. 1200.5(c).
    (2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters 
specified in the notice of the hearing in such order as the judge shall 
announce.
    (d) Evidence--(1) General. The hearing shall be publicly conducted, 
and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.
    (i) Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or 
make affirmation. Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (ii) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the 
hearing, the judge may limit the number of times any witness may testify 
to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative 
evidence.
    (iii) The judge shall, insofar as practicable, exclude evidence 
which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not 
of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to any other ruling of the judge during the hearing, 
such party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon 
an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the 
judge. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon 
except as ordered by the judge. The ruling of the judge on any objection 
shall be a part of the transcript. Only objections made before the judge 
may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, when admissible for any

[[Page 11]]

purpose, shall be admissible as evidence without the presence of the 
person who made or prepared the same. The judge shall exercise 
discretion in determining whether an official publication of such record 
or document shall be necessary, or whether a copy would be permissible. 
If permissible such a copy should be attested to by the person having 
legal custody of it, and accompanied by a certificate that such person 
has the custody.
    (4) Exhibits. All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon satisfactory showing of 
authenticity, relevancy, and materiality, be numbered as exhibits and 
received in evidence and made a part of the record. Such exhibits shall 
be submitted in quadruplicate and in documentary form. In case the 
required number of copies is not made available, the judge shall 
exercise discretion as to whether said exhibits shall, when practicable, 
be read in evidence or whether additional copies shall be required to be 
submitted within a time to be specified by the judge. If the testimony 
of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report or document (including 
the record of any previous hearing), the judge, after inquiry relating 
to the identification of such statute, report, or document, shall 
determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and 
physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it 
shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and 
material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report or document 
(including the record of any previous hearing) containing immaterial or 
irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be 
excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the 
direction of the judge.
    (5) Official notice. Official notice at the hearing may be taken of 
such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United 
States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial 
fact of established character: Except that interested persons shall be 
given an adequate period of time, at the hearing or subsequent to it, of 
matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.
    (6) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a 
brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence 
consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be 
inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be 
considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the 
judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall 
not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such 
evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In 
the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the judge erred in 
excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing 
shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.10  Oral and written arguments.

    (a) Oral argument before the judge. Oral argument before the judge 
shall be in the discretion of the judge. Such argument, when permitted, 
may be limited by the judge to any extent that the judge finds necessary 
for the expeditious disposition of the proceeding and shall be reduced 
to writing and made part of the transcript.
    (b) Briefs, proposed findings, and conclusions. The judge shall 
announce at the hearing a reasonable period of time within which 
interested persons may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings and 
conclusions, and written arguments or briefs, based upon the evidence 
received at the hearing, citing, where practicable, the page or pages of 
the transcript of the testimony where such evidence appears. Factual 
material other than that adduced at the hearing or subject to official 
notice shall not be alluded to therein, and, in any case, shall not be 
considered in the formulation of the order. If the person filing a brief 
desires the Secretary to consider any objection made by such person to a 
ruling of the judge, as provided in Sec. 1200.9(d), that person shall 
include in the brief a

[[Page 12]]

concise statement concerning each such objection, referring, where 
practicable, to the pertinent pages of the transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.11  Certification of the transcript.

    The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing 
as soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written 
arguments, briefs, proposed findings, and proposed conclusions and shall 
furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be 
necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall 
transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the 
transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the 
exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. The 
judge shall attach to the original transcript of the testimony a 
certificate stating that, to the best of the judge's knowledge and 
belief, the transcript is a true transcript of the testimony given at 
the hearing, except in such particulars as the judge shall specify, and 
that the exhibits transmitted are all the exhibits as introduced at the 
hearing with such exceptions as the judge shall specify. A copy of such 
certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the transcript of 
testimony. In accordance with such certificate the hearing clerk shall 
note upon the official record copy, and cause to be noted on other 
copies of the transcript, each correction detailed therein by adding or 
crossing out (but without obscuring the text as originally transcribed) 
at the appropriate place any words necessary to make the same conform to 
the correct meaning, as certified by the judge. The hearing clerk shall 
obtain and file certifications to the effect that such corrections have 
been effectuated in copies other than the official record copy.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.12  Copies of the transcript.

    (a) During the period in which the proceeding has an active status 
in the Department, a copy of the transcript and exhibits shall be kept 
on file in the office of the hearing clerk where it shall be available 
for examination during official hours of business. Thereafter said 
transcript and exhibits shall be made available by the hearing clerk for 
examination during official hours of business after prior request and 
reasonable notice to the hearing clerk.
    (b) Transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at 
actual cost of duplication.

hearing clerk a recommended decision.

Administrator's proposed order and a brief in support of such 
exceptions. Such exceptions shall be in writing, shall refer, where 
practicable, to the related pages of the transcript, and may suggest 
appropriate changes in the proposed order.
    (d) Omission of recommended decision. The procedure provided in this 
section may be omitted only if the Secretary finds on the basis of the 
record that due and timely execution of the Secretary's functions 
imperatively and unavoidably requires such omission.

[[Page 13]]

its effective date and any determinations to be made under Sec. 1200.16: 
Except that such order shall not be executed, issued, or made effective

<R05>
Sec. 1205.27  Participation in the sign-up period.

    The sign-up period will be from June 3, 2002, through August 30, 
2002. Those persons who favor the conduct of a continuance referendum 
and who wish to request that USDA conduct such a referendum may do so by 
submitting such request in accordance with this section. All requests 
must be received by the appropriate USDA office by August 30, 2002.
    (a) Before the sign-up period begins, FSA shall establish a list of 
known, eligible, Upland cotton producers in the county that it serves 
during the representative period, and shall also establish a list of 
known, eligible Upland cotton importers.
    (b) Before the start of the sign-up period, USDA shall mail a 
request form to each known, eligible, cotton importer. Importers who 
wish to request a referendum and who do not receive a request form in 
the mail by June 3, 2002, may participate in the sign-up period by 
submitting a signed, written request for a continuance referendum, along 
with a copy of a U.S. Customs form 7501 showing payment of a cotton 
assessment for calendar year 2001. Importers must submit their requests

whose name does not appear on the county FSA office list may participate 
in the sign-up period. Such person must be identified on FSA-578 during 
the representative period or provide documentation that demonstrates 
that the person was a cotton producer during the representative period. 
Cotton producers not listed on the FSA-578 shall submit at least one 
sales receipt for cotton they planted during the representative period. 
Cotton producers must make requests to the county FSA office where the 
producer's farm is located. If the producer's land is in more than one 
county, the producer shall make request at the county office where FSA 
administratively maintains and processes the producer's farm records. It 
is the responsibility of the person to provide the information needed by 
the county FSA office to determine eligibility. It is not the 
responsibility of the county FSA office to obtain this information. If 
any person whose name does not appear on the county FSA office list 
fails to provide at least one sales receipt for the cotton they produced 
during the representative period, the county FSA office shall determine 
that such person is ineligible to participate in the sign-up period, and 
shall note ineligible in the remarks section next to the person's name 
on the county FSA office sign-up sheet. In lieu of personally appearing 
at a county FSA office, eligible producers may request a sign-up form 
from the county FSA office where the producer's farm is located. If the 
producer's land is in more than one county, the producer shall make the 
request for the sign-up form at the county office where FSA 
administratively maintains and processes the producer's farm records. 
Such request must be accompanied by a copy of at least one sales receipt 
for cotton they produced during the representative period. The 
appropriate FSA office must receive all completed forms and supporting 
documentation by August 30, 2002.

    Any cotton producer organization within a cotton-producing State may 
request the Secretary for certification of eligibility to participate in 
nominating members and alternate members to represent such State on the 
Cotton Board. Such eligibility shall be

[[Page 28]]

based in addition to other available information upon a factual report 
submitted by the organization which shall contain information deemed 
relevant and specified by the Secretary for the making of such 
determination, including the following:
    (a) Geographic territory within the State covered by the 
organization's active membership;
    (b) Nature and size of the organization's active membership in the 
State, proportion of total of such active membership accounted for by 
farmers, a map showing the cotton-producing counties in such State in 
which the organization has members, the volume of cotton produced in 
each such county, the number of cotton producers in each such county, 
and the size of the organization's active cotton producer membership in 
each such county;
    (c) The extent to which the cotton producer membership of such 
organization is represented in setting the organization's policies;

derived;
    (f) Functions of the organization; and

organization shall be whether its cotton producer membership consists of 
a sufficiently large number of cotton producers who produce a relatively 
significant volume of cotton to reasonably warrant its participation in 
the nomination of members for the Cotton Board. Any cotton producer 
organization found eligible by the Secretary under this Sec. 1205.341 
will be certified by the Secretary, and the Secretary's determination as 
to eligibility is final.

derived;

large number of cotton importers who import a relatively significant 
volume of cotton to reasonably warrant its participation in the 
nomination of members for the Cotton Board. Any importer organization 
found eligible by the Secretary under this Sec. 1205.342 will be

<R05>
Sec. 1205.510  Levy of assessments.

    (a) Producer assessments. An assessment of $1 per bale for cotton 
research and promotion is hereby levied on each bale of Upland cotton 
that is produced from cotton harvested and ginned except cotton consumed 
by any governmental agency from its own production. Such assessment 
shall be payable and collected only once on each bale.
    (1) A supplemental assessment for cotton research and promotion in 
addition to the $1 per bale assessment provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section, is hereby levied on each bale of Upland cotton harvested 
and ginned except cotton consumed by any governmental agency from its 
own production. The supplemental assessment rate shall be levied at the 
rate of five-tenths of one percent of:
    (i) The current value of the cotton multiplied by the number of 
pounds of lint cotton or;
    (ii) The current value of the cotton converted to a fixed amount per 
bale as reflected in the following assessment chart:

\1\ Assessment is calculated on \5/10\ of 1 percent of the midpoint of
  each 10[cent] increment, based on a 500 lb. bale and converted to a
  fixed amount per bale.

    (2) Each marketing year the collecting handler must select one of 
the two options for collecting the supplemental assessment as provided 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The handler shall notify the Cotton 
Board as to the method selected at the time the handler files the first 
handler report each marketing year.

[[Page 33]]

    (b) Importer assessment. An assessment for cotton research and 
promotion of $1 per bale is hereby levied on each bale of cotton, or the 
bale equivalent thereof for cotton in cotton-containing products 
identified in the HTS conversion factor table in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section and imported into the United States on or after July 31, 
1992. The $1 per bale assessment shall be converted to a fixed amount 
per kilogram to facilitate the U.S. Customs Service in collecting this 
assessment.
    (1) A supplemental assessment for cotton research and promotion in 
addition to the $1 per bale assessment provided for in paragraph (b) of 
this section is hereby levied on each bale of cotton or bale equivalent 
of cotton in cotton-containing products, identified in this subpart, 
imported into the United States on or after July 31, 1992. The 
supplemental assessment shall be levied at the rate of five-tenths of 
one percent of the historical value of cotton as determined by the 
Secretary and expressed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The rate of 
the supplemental assessment on imported cotton will be the same as that 
levied on cotton produced within the United States. The supplemental 
assessment will be calculated as a fixed amount per kilogram and added 
to the $1 per bale or bale equivalent assessment to facilitate the 
Customs Service in collecting assessments.
    (2) The 12-month average of monthly weighted average prices received 
by U.S. farmers will be calculated annually. Such weighted average will 
be used as the value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying the 
supplemental assessment on imported cotton and will be expressed in 
kilograms. The value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying this 
supplemental assessment is $0.862 per kilogram.
    (3) The following table contains Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) 
classification numbers and corresponding conversion factors and 
assessments. The left column of the following table indicates the HTS 
classifications of imported cotton and cotton-containing products 
subject to assessment. The center column indicates the conversion factor 
for determining the raw fiber content for each kilogram of the HTS. HTS 
numbers for raw cotton have no conversion factor in the table. The right 
column indicates the total assessment per kilogram of the article 
assessed.
    (i) Any line item entry of cotton appearing on Customs entry 
documentation in which the value of the cotton contained therein results 
in the calculation of an assessment of two dollars ($2.00) or less will 
not be subject to assessments as described in this section.
    (ii) In the event that any HTS number subject to assessment is 
changed and such change is merely a replacement of a previous number and 
has no impact on the physical properties, description, or cotton content 
of the product involved, assessments will continue to be collected based 
on the new number.

<R05>
Sec. 1207.320  Establishment and membership.

    (a) There is hereby established a National Potato Promotion Board, 
hereinafter called the ``Board'', composed of producers, importers, and 
a public member appointed by the Secretary. Producer members shall be 
appointed from nominations submitted by producers in the various States 
or groups of States pursuant to Sec. 1207.322. Importer members shall be 
appointed

[[Page 48]]

from nominations submitted by importers pursuant to Sec. 1207.322. The 
public member shall be nominated by Board members in such manner as 
recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary, and shall be 
appointed by the Secretary.
    (b) Producer membership upon the Board shall be determined on the 
basis of the potato production reported in the latest Crop Production 
Annual Summary Report issued by the Crop Reporting Board, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. Unless the Secretary, upon recommendation of 
the Board, determines an alternate basis, for each five million 
hundredweight of such production, or major fraction thereof, produced 
within each State, such State shall be entitled to one member. However, 
each State shall initially be entitled to at least one member.
    (c) The number of importer member positions on the Board shall be 
based on the hundredweights of potatoes, potato products equivalent to 
fresh potatoes, and seed potatoes imported into the United States but 
shall not exceed five importer members. Unless the Secretary, upon 
recommendation of the Board, determines an alternate basis, there shall 
be one importer member position for each 5 million hundredweight, or 
major fraction thereof, of potatoes, potato product equivalents, and 
seed potatoes imported into the United States.
    (d) Any State in which the potato producers fail to respond to an 
officially called nomination meeting may be combined with an adjacent 
State for the purpose of representation on the Board, in which case the 
Board's producer member selected by the Secretary will represent both 
States, but such member's voting power under Sec. 1207.325 shall not be 
increased.
    (e) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the Board, may establish, 
through rule making procedure, districts or groups of States in order to 
change the representation requirements for membership on the Board. In 
such event the voting power of members under Sec. 1207.325 would be 
based upon the total production within the new district or group of 
States.
    (f) Should the Board fail to nominate a public member, the Secretary 
may appoint such member.

Sec. 1207.321  Term of office.

determined that approximately one-third of the terms will expire each 
year. Importer and public member terms shall run concurrently. All 
members serving on the Board on the effective date of this amendment to 
the Plan shall continue serving the term to which they were appointed.
    (c) Board members shall serve during the term of office for which 
they are selected and have qualified, and until their successors are 
selected and have qualified.

office.

<R05>
Sec. 1207.322  Nominations and appointment.

    The Secretary shall select the producer, importer, and public 
members of the Board from nominations which may be made in the following 
manner.
    (a) A meeting or meetings of producers shall be held in each State 
to nominate producer members for the Board. For nominations to the 
initial Board the meetings shall be announced by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. The Department may call upon other organizations to assist 
in conducting the meetings such as State and national organizations of 
potato producers. Such nomination meetings shall be held not later than 
60 days after the issuance of this subpart. Any organization designated 
to hold such nomination meetings shall give adequate notice of such 
meetings to the potato producers affected; also to the Secretary so that 
a representative of

[[Page 49]]

the Secretary, if available, may conduct such meetings or act as 
secretary of such nomination meetings.
    (b) After the establishment of the initial Board, the nominations 
for subsequent Board producer members shall be made by producers at 
meetings in the producing sections or States. The Board shall hold such 
meetings, or cause them to be held, in accordance with rules established 
pursuant to recommendation of the Board.
    (c) Only producers may participate in designating producer nominees. 
Each producer is entitled to one vote only on behalf of himself, his 
partners, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and representatives for each 
position for which nominations are being held. If a producer is engaged 
in producing potatoes in more than one State, he shall elect the State 
in which he shall vote. In no event shall he vote in nominations in more 
than one meeting.
    (d) The importer members shall be nominated by importers of 
potatoes, potato products and/or seed potatoes. The number of importer 
members on the Board shall be announced by the Secretary and shall not 
exceed five members. The Board may call upon organizations of potato, 
potato products and/or seed potato importers to assist in nominating 
importers for membership on the Board. If such organizations fail to 
submit nominees or are determined by the Board to not adequately 
represent importers, then the Board may conduct meetings of importers to 
nominate eligible importers for Board member positions. In determining 
if importer organizations adequately represent importers, the Board 
shall consider:
    (1) How many importers belong to the association;
    (2) What percentage of the total number of importers is represented 
by the association;
    (3) Is the association representative of the potato, potato product, 
and seed potato import industry;
    (4) Does the association speak for potato, potato product, and seed 
potato importers; and
    (5) Other relevant information as may be warranted.
    (e) The public member shall be nominated by the producer and 
importer members of the Board. The public member shall have no direct 
financial interest in the commercial production or marketing of potatoes 
except as a consumer and shall not be a director, stockholder, officer 
or employee of any firm so engaged. The Board shall prescribe such 
additional qualifications, administrative rules and procedures for 
selection and voting for each candidate as it deems necessary and the 
Secretary approves.

FR 44036, Aug. 26, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1207.511  Determination of assessable quantity.

    The assessable quantity of potatoes in any lot shall be determined 
on the basis of utilization. Assessments shall be due on the entire lot 
handled for human consumption, seed, or unspecified purposes if there is 
no accounting made on the basis of the utilization of such lot. However, 
if the accounting identifies all or portions of such lot on the basis of 
utilization, assessments shall be due only on that portion utilized for 
human consumption and seed.


<R05>
Sec. 1207.512  Designated handler.

    The assessment on each lot of potatoes produced in the 50 States of 
the United States and handled shall be paid by the designated handler as 
hereafter set forth.
    (a) Unless otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(8), (b), and (c) of 
this section, the designated handler shall be the first handler of such 
potatoes. The first handler is the person who initially performs a 
handler function as heretofore defined. Such person may be a fresh 
shipper, processor, or other person who first places the potatoes in the 
channels of commerce. A producer who grades, packs, or otherwise 
performs handler functions thereby becomes a handler and as such assumes 
first handler responsibilities under this part. The following examples 
are provided to aid in identification of first handlers who are 
designated handlers:
    (1) Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a 
handler

[[Page 57]]

for preparation for market. The handler in this instance is the 
designated handler, regardless of whether he subsequently handles such 
potatoes for his own account or for the account of the producer.
    (2) Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a 
handler who takes title to such potatoes and places them in storage for 
subsequent handling. The handler who purchases such potatoes from the 
producer is the designated handler.
    (3) Producer delivers field-run potatoes to a commercial storage 
facility for the purpose of holding such potatoes under his own account 
for later sale. There is no designated handler in this instance since 
such potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no 
assessment is due. The designated handler of such potatoes would be 
identified on the basis of subsequent handling of such potatoes.
    (4) Fresh shipper purchases a lot of potatoes from a producer, packs 
a portion of such potatoes for fresh market, and delivers the balance to 
a processor. The fresh shipper is the designated handler for all 
potatoes in the lot.
    (5) Handler purchases potatoes from a producer's field or storage 
for the purpose of preparing such potatoes for market or for 
transporting such potatoes to storage for subsequent handling. The 
handler who purchases such potatoes from the producer is the designated 
handler.
    (6) Producer packs and sells potatoes of his own production from the 
field, roadside stand, or storage to a consumer, itinerant trucker, or 
other buyer. In performing such handler functions the producer assumes 
the responsibility of designated handler.
    (7) Processor utilizes potatoes of his own production in the 
manufacture of potato chips, frozen, dehydrated, or canned products for 
human consumption. In so handling potatoes, the processor assumes the 
responsibility of designated handler.
    (8) Producer utilizes potatoes of his own production for seed in 
planting his subsequent crop. Such seed potatoes do not enter the 
current of commerce; there is no designated handler in this instance 
since the potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no 
assessment is due. However, seed potatoes sold or shipped to other 
producers for planting or to other persons for subsequent disposition 
enter the current of commerce and are subject to assessment. The 
producer of seed potatoes shall be the designated handler of such 
potatoes shipped to other producers for planting and the assessment is 
due when he first sells or otherwise handles such potatoes. The first 
person who acquires seed potatoes from the producer thereof for 
subsequent disposition other than planting by said person shall be the 
designated handler of such potatoes. However, the seed producer will be 
the designated handler responsible for filing reports and making 
payments, unless he can show that the first person who obtained the 
potatoes from him disposed of them other than by planting. To show this 
the seed producer must submit to the Potato Board the name and address 
of the first person who obtained the potatoes from him and an invoice of 
sale or settlement sheet on which it is indicated that such person will 
be the designated handler and therefore will be responsible for the 
payment of the assessments. Only by showing this is the seed producer no 
longer considered the designated handler and therefore not liable for 
the assessments.
    (b) Any person who handles potatoes for a producer thereof under 
oral or written contract or agreement providing for the sale thereof 
shall be the designated handler for such potatoes, notwithstanding the 
fact that the producer may have graded, packed, or otherwise handled 
such potatoes and thereby became the first handler of such potatoes.
    Examples. A cooperative marketing association, or other person, who 
makes an accounting to the producer, or pay the proceeds of the sale to 
the producer would be the designated handler responsible for the 
assessment.
    (c) Any processor who purchases potatoes from the producer thereof 
shall be the designated handler even though the producer may have 
graded, packed, or otherwise handled such potatoes and

[[Page 58]]

thereby became the first handler of such potatoes.

<R05>
Sec. 1207.513  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Time of payment. The assessment on domestically produced 
potatoes shall become due at the time a determination of assessable 
potatoes is made in the normal handling process, pursuant to 
Sec. 1207.511. If no determination is made of the utilization of a lot, 
assessments shall be due on the entire lot when it enters the current of 
commerce. The assessment on imported potatoes, potato products, and seed 
potatoes shall become due at the time of entry, or withdrawal, for 
consumption into the United States.
    (b) Responsibility for payment. (1) The designated handler is 
responsible for payment of the assessment on domestically produced 
potatoes. He may pay with no reimbursement from the producer. In the 
alternative, he may collect the assessment from the producer, or deduct 
such assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer on whose potatoes 
the assessment is made, provided he furnishes the producer with evidence 
of such payment. Any such collection or deduction of assessment shall be 
made not later than the time when the assessment becomes payable by the 
handler to the Board. Failure of the handler to collect or deduct such 
assessment does not relieve the handler of his obligation to remit the 
assessment to the Board.
    (2) The Customs Service shall collect payment of assessment on 
imported potatoes, potato products, and seed potatoes from importers and 
forward such assessment per agreement between the Customs Service and 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Importers shall be responsible for 
payment of assessment directly to the Board of any assessment due but 
not collected by the Customs Service at the time of entry, or 
withdrawal, for consumption into the United States. An importer may 
apply to the Board for reimbursement of assessments paid on exempted 
products.
    (c) Payment directly to the Board. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, each designated handler or 
importer shall remit assessments directly to the Board by check, draft, 
or money order payable to the National Potato Promotion Board, or NPPB, 
not later than 10 days after the end of the month such assessment is due 
together with a report (preferably on Board forms) thereon.
    (2) All designated handlers, including a designated handler whose 
own production is handled and assessments to the Board paid by another 
designated handler, shall report to the Board:
    (i) Date of report (which is also date of payment to the Board).
    (ii) The name and address of the designated handler;
    (iii) The period potatoes were handled;
    (iv) The total quantity of potatoes determined to be assessable 
during the period potatoes were handled, pursuant to Sec. 1207.511.
    (3) Designated handlers who collect assessments from producers or 
withhold assessments from their accounts or pay the assessment 
themselves shall also include a list of all such producers whose 
potatoes were handled during the period, their addresses and the total 
assessable quantities handled for each such producer.
    (i) In lieu of such a list, the designated handler may substitute 
authentic copies of settlement sheets given to each producer provided 
such settlement sheets contain all the information listed above.
    (ii) The words ``final report'' shall be shown on the last report at 
the close of his marketing season or at the end of each fiscal period if 
such handler markets potatoes on a year-round basis.
    (4) Prepayment of assessment: (i) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
and reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Board 
may permit designated handlers to make advance payments of their total 
estimated assessments for the season to the Board prior to their actual 
determination of assessable potatoes. Such procedure may be permitted 
when it is considered by the designated handler to be the more practical 
method of payment.
    (ii) Persons using such procedure shall provide a final annual 
accounting of actual handling and assessments.

[[Page 59]]

    (iii) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board upon request.
    (d) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may authorize 
other organizations to collect assessments in its behalf. In any State 
or area in which the Board has negotiated an agreement to collect 
assessments with an agency such as a State Potato Commission or a Potato 
Association approved by the Secretary, the designated handler shall pay 
the assessment to such agency in the time and manner, and with such 
identifying information as specified in such agreement. Such an 
agreement shall not provide any cooperating agency with authority to 
collect confidential information from handlers; to qualify, the 
cooperating agency must on its own accord have access to all information 
required by the Board for collection purposes. If the Board requires 
further evidence of payment than provided, it may acquire such evidence 
from individual designated handlers.
    (1) All such agreements are subject to the requirement of 
Sec. 1207.352 Confidential treatment, of the plan, the provisions of 
section 310(c) of the Act, and all applicable rules and regulations and 
financial safeguards in effect under the Act and the plan; and all 
affected persons shall agree to, and conduct their operations and 
activities in accordance with, such requirements.

required. The slates shall be prepared not later than 5 days after the 
date for receiving names of candidates by the election committee.
    (f) After all candidates have been listed on the slates of 
candidates, the slates shall be supplied to an independent certified

committee. To the maximum extent practicable, ballots will be 
distributed to all persons who are eligible to vote for candidates under 
this subpart in the segment of the industry, the region, or in the 
United States as a whole, as applicable, to which the ballot pertains. 
Ballots that are not returned to the CPA firm within 20 days shall be 
declared invalid. The votes for each candidate on the ballots shall be 
tallied by the CPA firm at the end of the voting period and the results 
furnished to the election committee. The election committee shall issue 
a news release setting forth the names of the candidates and the number 
of votes received by each candidate within 5 days after the voting 
period has ended. Those candidates on each of the ballots who rank 
first, second, third, and fourth in the number of votes received for 
each seat on the Council shall be declared the nominees for each such 
seat.
    (g) The names of those declared the nominees for each of the seats

seats be declared the member of the Council and the nominee with the

alternate member. The Secretary shall then appoint from the nominees so 
provided the members and their alternates for each of such seats on the 
Council.
    (h) Subsequent elections of nominees and appointment of members and 
alternates as terms expire shall be conducted by the Council or the 
Council staff in the manner similar to that described above except that 
the Council shall act as the election committee for which provision is 
made in this section. The nomination and election process shall be 
completed at least 90 days before the beginning of each nominee's term 
of office.

segment(s), region(s), or area(s) of the industry to fill the vacancy or

willful misconduct, the Council may recommend to the Secretary that the 
member be removed from office. If the Secretary finds that the 
recommendation of the Council shows adequate cause, the Secretary shall 
remove such member from office. Further, without recommendation of the 
Council, a member may be removed by the Secretary upon a showing of 
adequate cause, if the Secretary determines that the person's continued

and greens, as well as for research related to cut flowers and greens in 
accordance with the following:
    (a) The Council shall develop, or contract for the development of, 
plans and projects for advertising, sales promotion, other promotion, 
and for dissemination of consumer information, with respect to cut 
flowers and greens, and may disburse such funds as necessary for these 
purposes after such plans or projects have been submitted to, and 
approved by, the Secretary. Any such plan or project shall be directed 
toward increasing the general demand for cut flowers and greens and 
shall not make reference to a private brand or trade name, point of 
origin, or source of supply, except that the Council may offer such 
plans and projects of the Council for use by commercial parties such as 
local, regional, State, or national floral industry organizations,

[[Page 70]]

and then only under terms and conditions prescribed by the Council and 
approved by the Secretary. No plan or project may make use of unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices with respect to quality or value.
    (b) The Council shall develop, or contract for the development of, 
plans and projects for research on the development of both established 
and new markets for cut flowers and greens and for research with respect 
to postharvest physiology, distribution, sale, marketing, use, and 
promotion of cut flowers and greens, as well as the dissemination of 
consumer information concerning cut flowers and greens. The Council is 
authorized to develop, or contract for the development of, such plans 
and projects for other research with respect to the marketing, 
promotion, and dissemination of information about cut flowers and greens 
as it finds appropriate. The Council may disburse such funds as 
necessary for these purposes after such plans or projects have been 
submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary.
    (c) The Council shall submit to the Secretary, for approval before

well as such plans and projects as may be developed by or approved by 
the Council for advertising, promotion, dissemination of information, 
and research. All such submissions to the Secretary shall be accompanied 
by a proposed budget showing the estimated expense to be incurred and 
the availability of revenue from which such expense may be paid. On 
approval of any such submission, the Council may proceed with the 
contract, plan or project and incur the expenses necessary to carry it 
out. Contracts or agreements to be submitted to the Secretary and 
entered into if approved by the Secretary shall, among such other 
matters as may be required, provide that:
    (1) The contracting or agreeing party shall develop and submit to 
the Council a plan or project, together with a budget that includes the 
estimated costs to be incurred for the plan or project;
    (2) The plan or project shall become effective on the approval of 
the Secretary; and
    (3) The contracting or agreeing party shall:
    (i) Keep accurate records of all of the transactions of the party;
    (ii) Account for funds received and expenses;
    (iii) Make periodic reports to the Council of activities conducted;

with experts from the production, import, wholesale, and retail segments 
of the cut flowers and greens industry to assist in the development of 
promotion, consumer information, and related research plans and 
projects. For these purposes, the Council may appoint special committees 
composed of persons other than Council members. A committee so appointed 
may not provide advice or recommendations to a representative of an 
agency, or an officer, of the Federal Government, and shall consult 
directly with the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.43  Other contracts and agreements.

    The Council may enter into contracts or agreements for 
administrative services, including contracts of employment, as may be 
required to conduct its business in accordance with such fiscal period 
budgets as may have been approved by the Secretary. To the extent 
appropriate to the contract involved, contracts entered into by the 
Council under the authority of this section shall contain provisions 
comparable to those described in Sec. 1208.42(c).

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1208.50  Assessments.

    (a) Each qualified handler, as defined in Sec. 1208.16, shall pay to 
the Council an assessment in an amount determined in accordance with 
this subpart, on each sale of cut flowers and greens to a retailer or an 
exempt handler (as defined in Sec. 1208.8) and on each non-sale transfer 
of cut flowers and greens to a retailer by a qualified handler that is a 
distribution center; as well as each direct sale of cut flowers and 
greens to a consumer by a producer that is a qualified handler, or by an 
importer that is

[[Page 71]]

a qualified handler. Such assessments shall be remitted by each 
qualified handler to the Council or its agent within 60 days after the 
end of the month in which the sale or non-sale transfer subject to 
assessment under this subpart took place. Such assessments shall be paid 
at the following rates:
    (1) During the first three years after December 29, 1994.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the 
rate shall be one-half of 1 (0.5) percent of the gross sales price of 
the cut flowers and greens sold;
    (ii) In the case of non-sale transfers to a retailer by a qualified 
handler that is a distribution center and in the case of direct sales by 
importers or producers, the rate shall be one-half of 1 (0.5) percent of 
the amount of each transaction's valuation for assessment as provided in 
paragraph (b);
    (2) After the first three years from December 29, 1994, the uniform 
assessment rate may be increased or decreased annually by not more than 
one-quarter of 1 (0.25) percent of the gross sales price of a product 
sold; or in the case of other transactions the amount of such 
transactions, except that the assessment rate may not exceed 1 percent 
of the gross sales price or the transaction amount. Changes in the rate 
of assessment may only be made if such changes are adopted by a two-
thirds majority vote of the Council and approved by the Secretary (after 
public notice and opportunity for comment as provided in the Act) as 
being necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act. Any such change 
so approved by the Secretary may be put into effect without a referendum 
but shall be announced not less than 30 days prior to the beginning of a 
fiscal year.
    (b) Each non-sale transfer of cut flowers and greens to a retailer 
from a qualified handler that is a distribution center shall be treated 
as a sale of cut flowers and greens to a retailer and shall be 
assessable. Each direct sale of cut flowers and greens to a consumer by 
a producer who is a qualified handler or an importer who is a qualified 
handler shall be assessable. These transactions shall be determined to 
have the following valuations for assessment purposes:
    (1) In the case of a non-sale transfer of cut flowers and greens 
from a distribution center that is a qualified handler and each direct 
sale of cut flowers and greens to a consumer by an importer that is a 
qualified handler, the amount of the valuation of the cut flowers and 
greens for assessment purposes shall be the price paid by the 
distribution center or importer to acquire the cut flowers and greens, 
and determined by multiplying the acquisition price by a uniform factor 
of 1.43 to represent the markup of a wholesale handler on a sale to a 
retailer.
    (2) In the case of a direct sale to a consumer by a producer who is 
a qualified handler, the valuation of the cut flowers and greens for 
assessment purposes shall be equal to an amount determined by 
multiplying the price paid by the consumer by a uniform factor of 0.50 
to represent the cost of producing the article and the markup of a 
wholesale handler on a sale to a retailer.
    (3) The Council may consider and adopt changes in the uniform 
factors specified in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section. Any 
such change shall not become effective until it has been adopted by a 
majority vote of the Council and approved by the Secretary after public 
notice and opportunity to comment on such change as provided in the Act. 
Changes so adopted and approved shall become effective at the beginning 
of the next fiscal year.
    (c) The collection of assessments shall commence on or after a date 
established by the Secretary, and shall continue until terminated by the 
Secretary. If the Council is not constituted on the date the first 
assessments are to be remitted, the Secretary shall have the authority 
to receive assessments on behalf of the Council and may hold such 
assessments in an interest bearing account until the Council is 
constituted, and the funds may be transferred to the Council.
    (d) Assessments shall be determined on the basis of the gross sales 
price. The Council, with the approval of the Secretary, may make uniform 
adjustments in determining the gross sales price when such adjustments 
reflect

[[Page 72]]

changes in trade practices or ensure equitable treatment of all 
qualified handlers paying assessments.
    (e) No assessments may be levied on any sale of cut flowers and 
greens for export from the United States. The Council is authorized to 
establish procedures for the verification of exports.
    (f) In general, assessment funds (less refunds, if any) shall be 
used:
    (1) For payment of costs incurred in implementing and administering 
this subpart;
    (2) To provide for a reasonable reserve to be maintained from 
assessments to be available for contingencies; and
    (3) To cover the administrative costs incurred by the Secretary in 
implementing and administering this Act.

    Note to Sec. 1208.50: The requirement to pay assessments is 
terminated as of July 29, 1997.

<R05>
Sec. 1208.51  Influencing governmental action.

    No funds collected by the Council shall in any manner be used for 
the purpose of influencing legislation or government action or policy, 
except to develop and recommend to the Secretary amendments to this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.52  Charges for late payments.

    Any assessment due the Council pursuant to Sec. 1208.50 that is not 
paid on time shall be increased 1.5 percent each month it remains unpaid 
beginning with the day following the date such assessment was due. If 
not paid in full, any remaining amount due, which shall include any 
unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be 
increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of each month 
thereafter until paid. For the purpose of this section, any assessment 
that was determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart 
because of a failure to submit a report when due shall be considered to 
have been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had 
been filed when due. The timeliness of a payment to the Council shall be 
based on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by 
the Council, whichever is earlier.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.53  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever the Council or the Secretary determines through an audit of 
a person's reports, records, books, or accounts or through some other 
means that additional money is due the Council or that money is due such 
person from the Council, such person shall be notified of the amount 
due. The person shall then remit any amount due the Council by the next 
date for remitting assessments. Overpayments shall be credited to the 
account of the person remitting the overpayment and shall be applied 
against amounts due in succeeding months.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.54  Refunds of assessments and escrow account.

    (a) Any qualified handler may demand and receive from the escrow 
account, subject to the limitation on such payments provided in 
paragraph (c), a one-time refund of any assessments paid by or on behalf 
of the handler if the handler requests the refund before the initial 
referendum on this subpart is held and this subpart is rejected by the 
voters when it is submitted to the referendum. Such a refund will be 
paid only if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The handler has paid the assessments sought to be refunded and 
has submitted proof of such payment;
    (2) The handler does not support the program established under this 
subpart and so states in the handler's demand for a refund;
    (3) The handler's demand for a refund is made on a form specified by 
the Council and filed not less than 10 days prior to the date when the 
initial referendum, conducted pursuant to Sec. 1208.60(a) to ascertain 
whether this subpart shall remain in effect, is scheduled to begin; and
    (4) This subpart is not approved by a simple majority of the votes 
cast by qualified handlers in the initial referendum.
    (b) The Council shall establish an escrow account to be used for 
assessment refunds, as needed, and shall place into

[[Page 73]]

the account an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of 
assessments collected during the period beginning on December 29, 1994 
and ending on the date the results of the initial referendum are issued 
and the initial referendum is completed.
    (c) If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to refund 
the total amount of assessments demanded by all qualified handlers 
determined eligible for refunds and this subpart is not approved in the 
referendum, the Council shall prorate the amount of all such refunds 
among all eligible qualified handlers that demand the refund. If there 
is any amount in excess of the amount needed to pay refunds and 
expenses, it shall be returned pro rata to those who paid assessments. 
If this subpart is approved in the referendum, there shall be no refunds 
made, and all funds in the escrow account shall be returned to the 
Council for use by the Council in accordance with the other provisions 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.55  Postponement of collections.

    (a) The Council may grant a postponement of the payment of an 
assessment under this subpart for any qualified handler that establishes 
that it is financially unable to make the payment. In order that a 
qualified handler that is financially unable to pay an assessment may 
have the opportunity to petition the Council to postpone payment of such 
an assessment, as provided in the Act, the Council shall develop forms 
and procedures for this purpose as expeditiously as possible and submit 
them to the Secretary for approval and issuance after notice and an 
opportunity for public comment thereon. Such procedures shall, among 
other things, require that the handler demonstrate the handler's 
inability to pay through the submission of an opinion prepared by an 
independent certified public accountant (at the handler's expense) and 
any other documentation specified therein to the effect that the handler 
is insolvent or will be unable to continue to operate if the handler is 
required to pay the assessment when due.
    (b) The procedures for obtaining a postponement of payment to be 
developed by the Council for submission to the Secretary shall also 
include provisions with respect to the period of postponement, the 
conditions of payment that may be imposed and the basis, if any, on 
which further extensions of the time for payment will be granted so as 
to appropriately reflect the demonstrated needs of the qualified 
handler.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.56  Determinations.

    (a) The Council is authorized to make the determinations required by 
this subpart as to the status of persons as qualified handlers and 
exempt handlers including determinations of the status of persons as 
qualified wholesale handlers, distribution centers that are qualified 
handlers, producers that are qualified handlers, importers that are 
qualified handlers, as well as such other determinations of status and 
facts as may be required for the effective administration of this 
subpart. Based on such determinations, the Council from time to time 
shall publish lists of exempt handlers who are not required to pay 
assessments, and lists of qualified handlers who are required to pay 
assessments under this subpart.
    (b) For the purpose of applying the $750,000 annual sales limitation 
to a specific person in order to determine the status of the person as a 
qualified handler or an exempt handler or to a specific facility in 
order to determine the status of the facility as an eligible separate 
facility for the purpose of referenda, the Council is authorized to 
determine the annual sales volume of a person or facility.
    (c) Any such determination shall be based on the sales of cut 
flowers and greens by the person or facility during the most recently-
completed calendar year, except that in the case of a new business or 
other operation for which complete data on sales during all or part of 
the most recently-completed calendar year are not available to the 
Council, the determination may be made using an alternative time period 
or other alternative procedures as the Council may find appropriate. In 
making such determinations, the Council is authorized to make 
attributions in accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this 
section and for the

[[Page 74]]

purpose of determining the annual sales volume of a person or a separate 
facility of a person, sales attributable to a person shall include:
    (1) In the case of an individual, sales attributable to the spouse, 
children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents of the person;
    (2) In the case of a partnership or member of a partnership, sales 
attributable to the partnership and other partners of the partnership;
    (3) In the case of an individual or a partnership, sales 
attributable to any corporation or other entity in which the individual 
or partnership owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity 
is not a corporation) that the individual or partnership controls; and
    (4) In the case of a corporation, sales attributable to any 
corporate subsidiary or other corporation or entity in which the 
corporation owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity is 
not a corporation) that the corporation controls.
    (d) The Council is also authorized to attribute any stock ownership 
interest as may be required to carry out this subpart. In doing so a 
stock ownership interest in the entity that is owned by the spouse, 
children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, or partners of an 
individual, or by a partnership in which a person is a partner, or by a 
corporation more than 50 percent of the stock of which is owned by a 
person, shall be treated as owned by the individual or person.
    (e) For the purpose of this subpart, the Council, with the approval 
of the Secretary, may require a person who sells cut flowers and greens 
to retailers to submit reports to the Council on annual sales by the 
person and on stock ownership.

Sec. 1208.150  Procedures for postponement of collections.

    (a) For a request for postponement of the payment of assessments to 
be

[[Page 77]]

granted, the qualified handler requesting such postponement must: Submit 
a written opinion from a Certified Public Accountant stating that the 
handler making the request is insolvent or will be unable to continue to 
operate if the handler is required to pay the assessments when due; and 
submit copies of the handler's last three (3) years' federal tax 
returns. The request must be in writing no later than 30 days after the 
assessment for the first month of the requested postponement period is 
due. Applications postmarked after the 30-day due date will not be 
considered by the Council. The qualified handler must file handler 
reports with the Council for each month during the postponement period. 
The postponement period may not exceed six (6) months unless an 
extension is requested and granted by the Council. Only one extension of 
up to six (6) months may be granted. Within the postponement period, the 
qualified handler will be exempt from paying assessments beginning with 
the first month for which the request for postponement is filed with the 
Council and for no more than six (6) months unless an extension is 
granted. The same procedures used for the initial request will be used 
to grant any extension. The written request must specify:
    (1) A reason for the request;
    (2) Detailed information concerning the qualified handler's name, 
address, and telephone and fax numbers;
    (3) The month(s) for which the request is made;
    (4) Assessments due per month or gross sales per month;
    (5) Total assessments due;
    (6) The percent or amount of the outstanding assessment to be paid 
each month after the postponement of payment is granted; and
    (7) The starting and ending date for the payment of assessments due.
    (b) At the end of the postponement period, the qualified handler 
must pay the percent or amount outstanding of assessments agreed upon 
each month as well as any other assessments which are due. An extension 
of time for payment of postponed assessments, if granted, will be for 
the same months previously requested and granted. The extension must not 
exceed six (6) months. If a qualified handler requests that another 
period be postponed, that handler must file another application for the 
postponement of the assessment for the second period using the same 
procedure which was followed in requesting the first postponement. A 
qualified handler may request the postponement of the payment of 
assessments for a maximum of two periods of up to six (6) months each. 
The payment applicable to the second postponement period, if granted, 
may not be extended, and the payment period must not exceed the length 
of the postponement period. Payment of the total assessments due, when 
an extension and a second period are granted, must begin within one (1) 
year after the first postponed month's assessments were originally due. 
No additional postponements would be considered by the Council until the 
assessments owed for the first two periods have been paid. The Council 
may conduct an audit of the qualified handler's records at any time to 
determine whether the qualified handler will be unable to continue to 
operate if the handler is required to pay the assessments due. In the 
event that postponed assessments are not paid when due, the Council can 
demand that all such assessments due be paid in their entirety.
    (c) Charges for late payment of assessments as described in 
Sec. 1208.52 will not be imposed on assessments for which postponement 
of payment has been granted.

provided in paragraph (c), importers shall be appointed by the Secretary

least 35,000,000 pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (b) For purposes of nominating and appointing producers to the 
Council, the United States shall be divided into four geographic regions 
and the number of Council members from each region shall be as follows:
    (1) Region 1: including Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, 
Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska,

    (c) Importers shall be represented by a single, separate region, 
referred to as Region 5, consisting of the United States as defined in 
Sec. 1209.21(b) when imports, on average, equal or exceed 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (d) At least every five years, and not more than every three years, 
the Council shall review changes in the geographic distribution of 
mushroom production volume throughout the United States and import 
volume, using the average annual mushroom production and imports over 
the preceding four years, and, based on such review, shall recommend to 
the Secretary reapportionment of the regions established in paragraph 
(b), or modification of the number of members from such regions, as 
determined under the rules established in paragraph (e), or both, as 
necessary to best reflect the geographic distribution of mushroom 
production volume in the United States and representation of imports, if 
applicable.
    (e) Subject to the nine-member maximum limitation, the following 
procedure will be used to determine the number of members for each 
region to serve on the Council under paragraph (d):
    (1) Each region that produces, on average, at least 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually shall be entitled to one representative on 
the Council.
    (2) As provided in paragraph (c), importers shall be represented by 
a single, separate region, which shall be entitled to one 
representative, if such region imports, on average, at least 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (3) Each region shall be entitled to representation by an additional 
Council member for each 50,000,000 pounds of annual production or 
imports, on average, in excess of the initial 35,000,000 pounds required 
to qualify the region for representation.

[[Page 81]]

    (4) Should, in the aggregate, regions be entitled to levels of 
representation under paragraphs (e) (1), (2) and (3) that would exceed 
the nine-member limit on the Council under the Act, the regions shall be 
entitled to representation on the Council as follows:
    (i) Each region first shall be assigned one representative on the 
Council pursuant to paragraphs (e) (1) and (2).
    (ii) Then, each region with 50,000,000 pounds of annual production 
or imports, on average, in excess of the initial 35,000,000 pounds 
required to qualify the region for representation shall be assigned one 
additional representative on the Council, except that if under such 
assignments all five regions, counting importers as a region, if 
applicable, would be entitled to additional representatives, that region 
with the smallest on-average volume, in terms of production or imports, 
will not be assigned an additional representative.
    (iii) After members are assigned to regions under paragraphs (e)(4) 
(i) and (ii), if less than the entire nine seats on the Council have 
been assigned to regions, the remaining seats on the Council shall be 
assigned to each region for each 50,000,000 pound increment of annual 
production or import volume, on average, in excess of 85,000,000 pounds 
until all the seats are filled. It for any such 50,000,000 pound 
increment, more regions are eligible for seats than there are seats 
available, the seat or seats assigned for such increment shall be 
assigned to that region or those regions with greater on-average 
production or import volume than the other regions otherwise eligible at 
that increment level.
    (f) In determining the volume of mushrooms produced in the United 
States or imported into the United States for purposes of this section, 
the Council and the Secretary shall:
    (1) Only consider mushrooms produced or imported by producers and 
importers, respectively, as those terms are defined in Secs. 1209.8 and 
1209.15; and
    (2) Use the information received by the Council under Sec. 1209.60, 
and data published by the Department.

appointment of producers and importers to serve on the Council, the term 
producer or importer refers to any individual who is a producer or 
importer, respectively, or if the producer or importer is an entity 
other than an individual, an individual who is an officer or employee of

the applicable region.
    (3) The regional caucus shall conduct the selection process for the 
nominees in accordance with procedures to be adopted at the caucus 
subject to the following requirements:
    (i) There shall be two individuals nominated for each open position.
    (ii) Each nominee shall meet the qualifications set forth in the 
call.
    (iii) If a producer nominee is engaged in the production of 
mushrooms in more than one region or is also an importer, such 
individual shall participate within the region that such individual so 
elects in writing to the Council and such election shall remain 
controlling until revoked in writing to the Council.
    (e) After the regional caucuses for the initial Council, the Council 
may conduct the selection of nominees by mail ballot in lieu of a 
regional caucus.
    (f) When producers or importers are voting for nominees to the 
Council, whether through a regional caucus or a mail ballot, the 
following conditions shall apply:
    (1) Voting for any open position shall be on the basis of:
    (i) One vote per eligible voter; and
    (ii) Volume of on-average production or imports of the eligible 
voter within that region.
    (2) Whenever the producers or importers in a region are choosing 
nominees for one open position on the Council, the proposed nominee with 
the highest number of votes cast and the proposed nominee with the 
highest volume of production or importers voted shall be the nominees 
submitted to the Secretary. If a proposed nominee receives both the 
highest number of votes cast and the highest volume of production or 
imports voted, then the proposed nominee with the second highest number 
of votes cast shall be a nominee submitted to the Secretary along with 
such proposed nominee receiving both the highest number of votes cast 
and the highest volume of production or imports voted.
    (3) Whenever the producers or importers in a region are choosing 
nominees for more than one open position on the Council at the same 
time, the number of the nominations submitted to the Secretary shall 
equal twice the number of such open positions, and for each open 
position shall consist of the proposed nominee with the highest number 
of votes cast and the proposed nominee with the highest volume of 
production or imports voted with respect to that position, subject to 
the rule set out in paragraph (f)(2). An individual shall only be 
nominated for one such open position.
    (4) Voters shall certify on their ballots as to their on-average 
production or import volume within the region involved. Such 
certification may be subject to verification.
    (g)(1) The Secretary may reject any nominee submitted. If there are 
insufficient nominees from which to appoint members to the Council as a 
result of the Secretary's rejecting such nominees, additional nominees 
shall be submitted to the Secretary under the procedures set out in this 
section.
    (2) Whenever producers or importers in a region cannot agree on 
nominees for an open position on the Council under the preceding 
provisions of this section, or whenever they fail to nominate 
individuals for appointment to the Council, the Secretary may appoint

[[Page 83]]

members in such manner as the Secretary, by regulation, determines 
appropriate.

Sec. 1209.33  Appointment.

    From the nominations made pursuant to Sec. 1209.31, the Secretary 
shall appoint the members of the Council on the basis of representation 
provided for in Sec. 1209.30, except that no more than one member may be 
appointed to the Council from nominations submitted by any one producer 
or importer.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.34  Term of office.

member each from regions 1, 2, and 3 shall be appointed for an initial 
term of two years; and one producer member each from regions 2, 3, and 4 
shall be appointed for an initial term of three years. Because current 
imports of fresh mushrooms are less than 35,000,000 pounds, the minimum 
established for representation on the Council, importers will not 
initially have a member appointed to the Council.
    (c)(1) Except with respect to terms of office of the initial 
Council, the term of office for each member of the Council shall begin 
on January 1 or such other date that may be approved by the Secretary.
    (2) The term of office for the initial Council shall begin 
immediately following appointment by the Secretary, except that time in 
the interim period from appointment until the following January 1, or 
such other date that is the generally applicable beginning date for 
terms under paragraph (c)(1) approved by the Secretary, shall not count 
toward the initial term of office.
    (d) Council members shall serve during the term of office for which 
they are appointed and have qualified, and until their successors are 
appointed and have qualified.
    (e)(1) No member shall serve more than two successive three-year 
terms, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii).
    (2)(i) Those members serving initial terms of two or three years may 
serve one successive three-year term.
    (ii) Those members serving initial terms of one year may serve two 
successive three-year terms.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.35  Vacancies.

    (a) To fill any vacancy occasioned by the death, removal, 
resignation, or disqualification of any member of the Council, the 
Secretary may appoint a successor from the most recent nominations 
submitted for open positions on the Council assigned to the region that 
the vacant position represents, or the Secretary may obtain nominees to 
fill such vacancy in such manner as the Secretary, by regulation, deems 
appropriate. Each such successor appointment shall be for the remainder 
of the term vacated. A vacancy will not be required to be filled if the 
unexpired term is less than six months.
    (b)(1) No successor appointed to a vacated term of office shall 
serve more than two successive three-year terms on the Council, except 
as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii).

successive three-year term.
    (ii) Any successor serving one year or less may serve two successive 
three-year terms.
    (c) If a member of the Council consistently refuses to perform the 
duties of a member of the Council, or if a member of the Council is 
known to be engaged in acts of dishonesty or willful misconduct, the 
Council may recommend to the Secretary that the member be removed from 
office. If the Secretary finds the recommendation of the Council shows 
adequate cause, the Secretary shall remove such member from office. 
Further, without recommendation of the Council, a member

[[Page 84]]

may be removed by the Secretary upon showing of adequate cause, 
including the failure by a member to submit reports or remit assessments 
required under this part, if the Secretary determines that such member's 
continued service would be detrimental to the achievement of the 
purposes of the Act.

    (1) The establishment, issuance, effectuation, and administration of 
appropriate programs for promotion, research, consumer information, and 
industry information with respect to mushrooms; and
    (2) The establishment and conduct of research with respect to the

products, and the creation of new products thereof, to the end that 
marketing and use of mushrooms may be encouraged, expanded, improved or 
made more acceptable. However, as prescribed by the Act, nothing in this 
subpart may be construed to authorize mandatory requirements for quality 
control, grade standards, supply management programs, or other programs 
that would control production or otherwise limit the right of individual 
producers to produce mushrooms.
    (b) No program, plan, or project shall be implemented prior to its 
approval by the Secretary. Once a program, plan, or project is so 
approved, the Council shall take appropriate steps to implement it.
    (c) Each programs, plan, or project implemented under this subpart 
shall be reviewed or evaluated periodically by the Council to ensure 
that it contributes to an effective program of promotion, research, 
consumer information, or industry information. If it is found by the

an effective program of promotion, research, consumer information, or 
industry information, then the Council shall terminate such program, 
plan, or project.
    (d) In carrying out any program, plan, or project, no reference to a 
brand name, trade name, or State or regional identification of any 
mushrooms or mushroom product shall be made. In addition, no program, 
plan, or project shall make use of unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
with respect to the quality, value, or use of any competing product.

<R05>
Sec. 1209.50  Budget and expenses.

    (a)(1) At least 60 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year,

least one preceding year;
    (iii) A summary of proposed expenditures for each program, plan, or 
project; and
    (iv) Staff and administrative expense breakdowns, with comparative 
data for at least one preceding year.

shall be paid from funds received by the Council.
    (c) The Council shall not use funds collected or received under this 
subpart to reimburse, defray, or make payment of expenditures incurred

or organizations, producers or importers, lawyers, law firms, or 
consultants.

only be used to pay expenses incurred in the conduct of programs, plans, 
and projects. Such contributions shall be free from any encumbrance by

by the Council, for administrative costs incurred by the Secretary in 
implementing and administering this subpart, except for the salaries of 
Department employees incurred in conducting referenda.

carry over to subsequent fiscal periods excess funds in any reserve so 
established, except that the funds in the reserve shall not exceed 
approximately one fiscal year's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used 
to defray any expenses authorized under this subpart.
    (g) With the approval of the Secretary, the Council may borrow money 
for the payment of administrative expenses, subject to the same fiscal, 
budget, and audit controls as other funds of the Council.

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1209.251  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Each first handler responsible for collecting assessments on 
domestic mushrooms shall collect the amounts assessed and remit such 
amounts to the Council on a monthly basis not later than the fifteenth 
day of the month following the month in which the mushrooms were 
marketed to or through the first handler.
    (b) Each producer responsible for paying any assessment amount on 
the producer's own mushrooms shall remit such amount to the Council on a 
monthly basis not later than the fifteenth day of the month following 
the month in which the mushrooms were marketed by the producer.
    (c) Each importer shall be responsible for remittance to the Council 
of any assessment amount not collected by the U.S. Customs Service at 
the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the United States. 
Any such assessment amount shall be remitted to the Council on a monthly 
basis not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the month 
of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the United States. Any 
person who imports mushrooms, as principal or as

[[Page 94]]

an agent, broker, or consignee for any person who produces mushrooms 
outside the United States for marketing in the United States shall be 
considered an importer.
    (d) Remittance shall be by check, draft, or money order payable to 
the Mushroom Council, and shall be accompanied by a report, on a form 
provided by the Council.
    (e) A late payment charge shall be imposed on any first handler or 
importer who fails to make timely remittance to the Council of the total 
assessment amount for which the person is liable. Such late payment 
charge shall be imposed on any assessments not received by the last day 
of the month following the month in which the mushrooms involved were 
marketed or, in the case of imports, not collected by the U.S. Customs 
Service at the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the 
United States. This one-time late payment charge shall be 10 percent of 
the assessments due before interest charges have accrued. The late 
payment charge will not be applied to any late payments postmarked 
within 15 days after the end of the month such assessments are due.
    (f) In addition to the late payment charge, interest shall be 
charged at a rate of one and one-half percent per month on the 
outstanding balance, including the late payment charge and any accrued 
interest, of any account that remains delinquent beyond the last day of 
the second month following the month the mushrooms involved were 
marketed. However, first handlers paying their assessments, in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, will not be subject to 
the one and one-half percent per month interest under this paragraph 
until the last day of the second month after such assessments are due 
under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. In the case of imports, such a 
rate of interest will be charged to any account that remains delinquent 
on any assessments not collected by the U.S. Customs Service at the time 
of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the United States. Such a 
rate of interest will continue to be charged monthly until the 
outstanding balance is paid to the Council.
    (g) Any assessment determined by the Council at a date later than 
prescribed by this section, because of a person's failure to submit a 
report to the Council when due, shall be considered to have been payable 
by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed on time. 
A late payment charge and monthly interest charges on the outstanding 
balance shall be applicable to such unpaid assessment in accordance with 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
    (h) In lieu of the monthly assessment payment and reporting 
requirements of Sec. 1209.260 of this subpart and Sec. 1209.60 of this 
part, the Council may permit a first handler to make advance payment of 
the total estimated assessment amount due to the Council for the ensuing 
fiscal year, or portion thereof, prior to the actual determination of 
assessable mushrooms.
    (1) Each person shall provide an initial report estimating 
assessable mushrooms. The Council may request additional information on 
such estimate.
    (2) Each person shall provide a final report of actual marketings 
during the period involved and remit any unpaid assessments not later 
than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the period 
covered.
    (3) Any person whose prepayment exceeds the amount paid shall be 
reimbursed for the amount of overpayment. The Council shall not, in any 
case, be obligated to pay interest on any advance payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.252  Exemption procedures.

    (a) Any person who produces or imports, on average, 500,000 pounds 
or less of mushrooms annually and who desires to claim an exemption from 
assessments during a fiscal year as provided in Sec. 1209.52 of this 
part shall apply to the Council, on a form provided by the Council, for 
a certificate of exemption. Such persons shall certify that their 
production or importation of mushrooms shall not exceed 500,000 pounds, 
on average, for the fiscal year for which the exemption is claimed. 
Pursuant to this section, the term on average shall be calculated by 
averaging a person's estimated production or importation for the fiscal 
year for which an exemption is claimed with

[[Page 95]]

such person's production or importation in the preceding fiscal year.
    (b) On receipt of an application, the Council shall determine 
whether an exemption may be granted. The Council then will issue, if 
deemed appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person that is 
eligible to receive one. Each person who is exempt from assessment must 
provide an exemption number to the first handler in order not to be 
subject to collection of an assessment on mushrooms. First handlers and 
importers, except as otherwise authorized by the Council, shall maintain 
records showing the exemptee's name and address along with the exemption 
number assigned by the Council. Importers who are exempt from assessment 
shall be eligible for reimbursement of assessments collected by the U.S. 
Customs Service and shall apply to the Council for reimbursement of such 
assessments paid.
    (c) Any person who desires to renew the exemption from assessments 
for a subsequent fiscal year shall reapply to the Council, on a form 
provided by the Council, for a certificate of exemption.
    (d) The Council may require persons receiving an exemption from 
assessments to provide to the Council reports on the disposition of 
exempt mushrooms.

                                 Reports


<R05>
Sec. 1209.260  Reports.

    Each first handler shall be required to report monthly to the 
Council such information as may be required under Sec. 1209.60(a) of 
this part. In addition, each first handler shall be required to provide 
the tax identification number or social security number of each producer 
the first handler has dealt with during the time period covered by the 
report.

mushroom production facilities and equipment as tenants in common, joint 
tenants, tenants by the entirety, or, under community property laws, as

agreement, informal or otherwise, contributed capital and others 
contributed labor, management, equipment, or other services, or any 
variation of such contributions by two or more parties so that it 
results in the production or importation of fresh mushrooms and the 
authority to transfer title to the mushrooms so produced or imported.

Board, hereinafter called the ``Board.'' The Board shall be composed of 
producers, handlers, importers, and one public representative appointed 
by the Secretary. An equal number of producer and handler 
representatives shall be nominated by producers and handlers pursuant to 
Sec. 1210.321. The Board shall also include one or more representatives 
of importers, who shall be nominated in such manner as may be prescribed 
by the Secretary. The public

[[Page 100]]

representative shall be nominated by the Board members in such manner as 
may be prescribed by the Secretary. If producers, handlers, and 
importers fail to select nominees for appointment to the Board, the 
Secretary may appoint persons on the basis of representation as provided 
in Sec. 1210.324. If the Board fails to adhere to procedures prescribed 
by the Secretary for nominating a public representative, the Secretary 
shall appoint such representative.
    (b) Membership on the Board shall be determined on the basis of two 
handler and two producer representatives for each of seven districts in 
the contiguous States of the United States. Such districts as hereby 
established have approximately equal production volume according to the 
three-year average production as set forth in the USDA Crop Production 
Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981. They are:

District #1--South Florida including all areas south of State Highway 
50.

Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, and New 
Mexico.
District #6--The State of Texas.
District #7--The States of Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, 
Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, and Montana.

    (c) After two years, the Board shall review the districts to 
determine whether realignment of the districts is necessary and at least 
every five years thereafter the Board shall make such a review. In 
making such review, it shall give consideration to:
    (1) The most recent three years USDA production reports or Board 
assessment reports if USDA production reports are unavailable;
    (2) Shifts and trends in quantities of watermelon produced, and
    (3) Other relevant factors.

As a result of this review, the Board may realign the districts subject 
to the approval of the Secretary. Any such realignment shall be 
recommended by the Board to the Secretary at least six months prior to 
the date of the call for nominations and shall become effective at least 
30 days prior to such date.
    (d) Importer representation on the Board shall be proportionate to 
the percentage of assessments paid by importers to the Board, except 
that at least one representative of importers shall serve on the Board.
    (e) Not later than 5 years after the date that importers are subject 
to the Plan, and every 5 years thereafter, the Secretary shall evaluate 
the average annual percentage of assessments paid by importers during 
the 3-year period preceding the date of the evaluation and adjust, to 
the extent practicable, the number of importer representatives on the 
Board.

watermelons from other producers, in a combined total volume that is 
equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own production; or the 
combined total volume of watermelon handled by the producer from the 
producer's own production and purchases from other producer's production 
is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production; and provided 
further, That if a producer or handler is engaged in the production or 
handling of watermelons in more than one State or district, the producer 
or handler shall participate within the State or district in which the 
producer or handler so elects in writing to the Board and such election 
shall remain controlling until revoked in writing to the Board.
    (f) The district convention chairperson shall conduct the selection 
process for the nominees in accordance with procedures to be adopted at 
each such convention, subject to requirements set in Sec. 1210.321(e).

shall have more than three producers and handlers representatives 
concurrently on the Board.
    (2) Each State represented at the district convention shall have one 
vote for each producer position and one vote for each handler position 
from the District on the Board, which vote shall be determined by the 
producers and handlers from that State by majority vote. Each State 
shall further have an additional vote for each five hundred thousand 
hundredweight volume as determined by the three year average annual crop 
production summary reports of the USDA, or if such reports are not 
published, then the three year average of the Board assessment reports; 
Provided, That for the first two calls for nominees, the USDA Crop 
Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981 will be 
controlling as to any additional production volume votes.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.340  Budget and expenses.

    (a) Prior to the beginning of each fiscal period, or as may be 
necessary thereafter, the Board shall prepare and recommend a budget on 
a fiscal period basis of its anticipated expenses and disbursements in 
the administration of this Plan, including probable costs of research, 
development, advertising, and promotion. The Board shall also recommend 
a rate of assessment calculated to provide adequate funds to defray its 
proposed expenditures and to provide for a reserve as set forth in 
Sec. 1210.344.
    (b) The Board is authorized to incur such expenses for research, 
development, advertising, or promotion of watermelons, such other 
expenses for the administration, maintenance, and functioning of the 
Board as may be authorized by the Secretary, and any referendum and 
administrative costs incurred by the Department of Agriculture. The 
funds to cover such expenses shall be paid from assessments received 
pursuant to Sec. 1210.341.

Sec. 1210.341  Assessments.

    (a) During the effective period of this subpart, assessments shall 
be levied on all watermelons produced and first handled in the United 
States and all watermelons imported into the United States for 
consumption as human food. No more than one assessment on a producer, 
handler, or importer shall be made on any lot of watermelons. The 
handler shall be assessed an equal amount on a per unit basis as the 
producer. If a person performs both producing and handling functions on 
any same lot of watermelons, both assessments shall be paid by such 
person. In the case of an importer, the assessment shall be equal to the 
combined rate for domestic producers and handlers and shall be paid by 
the importer at the time of entry of the watermelons into the United 
States.
    (b) Assessment rates shall be fixed by the Secretary in accordance 
with section 1647(f) of the Act. No assessments shall be levied on 
watermelons grown by producers of less than 10 acres of watermelons.
    (c) Each handler, as defined, is responsible for payment to the 
Board of both the producer's and the handler's assessment pursuant to 
regulations issued hereunder. The handler may collect producer 
assessments from the producer or deduct such assessments from the 
proceeds paid to the producer on whose watermelons the assessments are 
made. The handler shall maintain separate records for each producer's 
watermelons handled, including watermelons produced by said handler. In 
addition, the handler shall indicate the total quantity of watermelons 
handled by the handler, including those that are exempt under this Plan, 
and such other information as may be prescribed by the Board.
    (d) Each importer shall be responsible for payment of the assessment 
to the Board on watermelons imported into the United States through the 
U.S. Customs Service or in such other manner as may be established by 
rules

[[Page 105]]

and regulations approved by the Secretary.
    (e) Producer-handlers and handlers shall pay assessments to the 
Board at such time and in such manner as the Board, with the Secretary's 
approval, directs, pursuant to regulations issued under this part. Such 
regulations may provide for different handlers or classes of handlers 
and different handler payment and reporting schedules to recognize 
differences in marketing practices or procedures used in any State or 
production area.
    (f) There shall be a late payment charge imposed on any handler or 
importer who fails to remit to the Board the total amount for which any 
such handler or importer is liable on or before the payment due date 
established by the Board under paragraph (e) of this section. The amount 
of the late payment charge shall be set by the Board subject to approval 
by the Secretary.
    (g) There shall also be imposed on any handler or importer subject 
to a late payment charge, an additional charge in the form of interest 
on the outstanding portion of any amount for which the handler or 
importer is liable. The rate of such interest shall be prescribed by the 
Board subject to approval by the Secretary.
    (h) The Board is hereby authorized to accept advance payment of 
assessments by handlers and importers that shall be credited toward any 
amount for which the handlers and importers may become liable. The Board 
shall not be obligated to pay interest on any advance payment.
    (i) The Board is hereby authorized to borrow money for the payment 
of administrative expenses subject to the same fiscal, budget, and audit 
controls as other funds of the Board.
    (j) The Board may authorize other organizations to collect 
assessments in its behalf with the approval of the Secretary. Any 
reimbursement by the Board for such services shall be based on 
reasonable charges for services rendered.

Sec. 1210.342  Exemption from assessment.

    (a) The Board may exempt watermelons used for nonfood purposes from 
the provisions of this Plan and shall establish adequate safeguards 
against improper use of such exemptions.
    (b) Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year 
shall be entitled to apply for a refund that is equal to the rate of 
assessment paid by domestic producers.
    (c) The Secretary may adjust the quantity of the weight exemption 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the recommendation of the 
Board after an opportunity for public notice and comment to reflect 
significant changes in the 5-year average yield per acre of watermelons 
produced in the United States.
    (d) The Board shall have the authority to establish rules, with the 
approval of the Secretary, for certifying whether a person meets the

Sec. 1210.363  Suspension or termination.

    (a) Whenever the Secretary finds that this Plan or any provision 
thereof obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of 
the Act, the Secretary shall terminate or suspend the operation of this 
Plan or such provision thereof.
    (b) The Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time and shall 
hold a referendum on request of the Board or at least 10 percent of the 
combined total of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers to 
determine if watermelon producers, handlers, and importers favor 
termination or suspension of this Plan. The Secretary shall suspend or 
terminate this Plan at the end of the marketing year whenever the 
Secretary determines that the suspension or termination is favored by a 
majority of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers voting in 
such referendum who, during a representative period determined by the 
Secretary, have been engaged in the production, handling, or importing 
of watermelons and who produced, handled, or imported more than 50 
percent of the combined total of the volume of watermelons produced, 
handled, or imported by those producers, handlers, and importers voting 
in the referendum. For purposes of this section, the vote of a person 
who both produces and handles watermelons will be counted as a handler 
vote if the producer purchased watermelons from other producers, in a 
combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the 
producer's own production; or the combined total volume of watermelon 
handled by the producer from the producer's own production and purchases 
from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the 
producer's own production. Provided, That the vote of a person who both 
imports and handles watermelons will be counted as an importer vote if 
that person imports 50 percent or more of the combined total volume of 
watermelons handled and imported by that person. Any such referendum 
shall be conducted by mail ballot.

designation by the Secretary, shall become trustees of all funds and 
property then in possession or under control of the Board, including 
claims for any funds unpaid or property not delivered or any other claim 
existing at the time of such termination.
    (b) The said trustees shall:

other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person or 
persons full title and right to all the funds, property, and claims 
vested in the Board or the trustees pursuant to this section.
    (c) Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been 
transferred or delivered pursuant to this section shall be subject to 
the same obligation imposed upon the Board and upon the trustees.
    (d) A reasonable effort shall be made by the Board or its trustees 
to return to producers, handlers and importers any residual funds not 
required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation. If it is found 
impractical to return such remaining funds to producers, handlers and 
importers such funds shall be disposed of in such manner as the 
Secretary may determine to be appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.403  Voting procedures.

    (a) Proxy voting by producers and handlers for producer and handler 
nominees shall be permitted at all district conventions: Provided, That 
producers may cast proxy votes for producers only, and handlers may cast 
proxy votes for handlers only. In non-multi-State districts, proxy 
voting shall be permitted for all producer and handler nominee balloting 
to determine the districts' nominees. In multi-State districts, proxy 
voting shall be permitted for all producers and handlers participating 
in a State's balloting to determine the State's nominees. No other proxy 
voting, such as for district convention chairperson, shall be allowed. 
Any person wanting to cast proxy votes must demonstrate authorization to 
do so. Authority to cast a proxy vote on behalf of another person shall 
be demonstrated through documentation containing:
    (1) The proxy voter's name, address, and telephone number;
    (2) Signature and date signed;
    (3) A certification identifying the proxy voter as a producer or a 
handler; and
    (4) A statement identifying the person being given authority by the 
proxy voter to cast the proxy vote.

All proxy documentation must be received by the Board at its 
headquarters address at least two weeks before the

[[Page 110]]

district convention is scheduled to convene. For the purpose of the 
initial district convention, all proxy documentation must be forwarded 
to the Department representative identified in the call for the district 
convention in a manner that will ensure receipt, at the address 
specified in the call, at least 72 hours before the district convention 
is scheduled to convene. The Board, or in the case of the initial 
conventions the Department representative identified in the call or 
other representative of the Department, may challenge any proxy vote and 
disqualify any challenged vote for cause. In the case of duplicate proxy 
authorizations by any person, only the first authorization, determined 
by date will be allowed. In the case of duplicate dates, the proxy which 
is received first will be allowed.
    (b) In non-multi-State districts, convention chairpersons shall be 
elected by a majority vote of the eligible voters in attendance. In 
multi-State districts, the election shall be by majority vote of all 
States present with each State's vote(s) determined by a majority vote 
of the eligible voters of that State in attendance. Each such State is 
entitled to one vote, plus one additional vote for each 500,000 
hundredweight volume of production in the State as determined by the 
three-year average annual crop production summary reports of the 
Department or, if such reports are not published, then the three-year 
average of the Board's assessment reports: Provided, That for the first 
two conventions, the Department's Crop Production Annual Summary Reports 
for 1979, 1980, and 1981 will be controlling as to any additional 
production volume votes.
    (c) In multi-State districts 3, 4, 5 and 7, the convention 
chairperson will direct the eligible producer voters and handler voters 
from each State to caucus separately for the purpose of electing a State 
spokesperson for each group. Election of each State spokesperson shall 
be by simple majority of all individual voters in attendance. In lieu of 
written ballots, a State spokesperson may be elected by voice vote or a 
show of hands. The role of the State spokesperson is to coordinate State 
voting and to cast all State votes.
    (d) Convention chairpersons will coordinate the entire producer and 
handler nomination process. In conducting the nomination process, each 
convention chairperson will ensure that:
    (1) Voting for producer nominees is limited to producers, and voting 
for handler nominees is limited to handlers; and
    (2) Producer candidates for nomination are producers, and handler 
candidates for nomination are handlers.
    (e) Voting, for producer and handler nominees, in non-multi-State 
districts shall be on the basis of one vote per person, except that 
persons authorized to cast proxy votes shall be allowed to cast all 
proxy votes not disallowed by the Board or the Department. Election of 
nominees shall be on the basis of a simple majority of all eligible 
votes cast.
    (f) Voting for producer and handler nominees in multi-State 
districts shall be on a State by State basis. Producers and handlers 
from each State shall caucus separately, at the district convention, for 
the purpose of determining which nominees shall receive their State's 
vote(s) for membership on the Board. Each State's vote(s) shall be based 
on a simple majority of all votes (including proxy votes) cast by 
producers or handlers voting in their State's caucus. Each State 
represented at a multi-State district convention shall have one vote for 
each producer position and one vote for each handler position from the 
district on the Board. Each State shall further have an additional vote 
toward each position for each 500,000 hundredweight volume of production 
in the State as determined by the three-year average annual crop 
production summary reports of the Department or, if such reports are not 
published, then the three-year average of the Board's assessment 
reports: Provided, That for the first two calls for nominees, the 
Department's Crop Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 
1981 will be controlling as to any additional production volume votes. 
Each State spokesperson will cast the State's vote(s) for each nominee 
position. Election of nominees shall be on the basis of a simple 
majority of all State votes cast.

[[Page 111]]

    (g) During the voting for convention chairperson, State 
spokesperson, and Board member nominee, should no candidate receive the 
required simple majority on the first ballot, the number of candidates 
may be reduced by dropping one or more of the lowest vote recipients 
from the list of candidates. The balloting will be repeated until the 
position is filled.
    (h) Two nominees shall be elected for each of the producer and 
handler positions from each district on the Board. The two nominees for 
each position shall be elected simultaneously. The convention 
chairperson will open the floor to the nomination of candidates for 
possible election as a Board member nominee for each available position. 
Each position will be dealt with separately (i.e., candidates for one 
position will be nominated and then elected before the convention moves 
on to the next available position). Each eligible voter may vote for two 
of the nominees on one ballot. The two nominees receiving the greatest 
number of votes and at least a simple majority of the votes cast will be 
elected as the district's Board member nominees for the position. No 
individual elected as a nominee for Board membership may be a candidate 
on subsequent Board member nominee ballots (i.e., two different producer 
names and two different handler names must be submitted as nominees for 
each producer and handler position from each district to the Secretary 
of Agriculture). There shall be no designation of first and second 
choice nominees.

Sec. 1210.516  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1210.517  Determination of handler.

    The producer and handler assessments on each lot of watermelons 
handled shall be paid by the handler. Unless otherwise provided in this 
section, the handler responsible for payment of assessments shall be the 
first handler of such watermelons. The first handler is the person who 
initially performs a

[[Page 114]]

handling function as heretofore defined. Such person may be a fresh 
shipper, processor, or other person who first places the watermelons in 
the current of commerce.
    (a) The following examples are provided to aid in the identification 
of first handlers:
    (1) Producer grades, packs, and sells watermelons of own production 
to a handler. In this instance, it is the handler, not the producer, who 
places the watermelons in the current of commerce. The handler is 
responsible for payment of the assessments.
    (2) Producer packs and sells watermelons of that producer's own 
production from the field, roadside stand, or storage to a consumer, 
trucker, retail or wholesales outlet, or other buyer who is not a 
handler of watermelons. The producer places the watermelons in the 
current of commerce and is the first handler.
    (3) Producer purchases watermelons from another producer. The 
producer purchasing the watermelons is the first handler.
    (4) Producer delivers field-run watermelons of own production to a 
handler for preparation for market and entry into the current of 
commerce. The handler, in this instance, is the first handler, 
regardless of whether the handler subsequently handles such watermelons 
for the account of the handler or for the account of the producer.
    (5) Producer delivers field-run watermelons of own production to a 
handler for preparation for market and return to the producer for sale. 
The producer in this instance, is the first handler, except when the 
producer subsequently sells such watermelons to a handler.
    (6) Producer delivers watermelons of own production to a handler who 
takes title to such watermelons. The handler who purchases such 
watermelons from the producer is the first handler.
    (7) Producer supplies watermelons to a cooperative marketing 
association which sells or markets the watermelons and makes an 
accounting to the producer, or pays the proceeds of the sale to the 
producer. In this instance, the cooperative marketing association 
becomes the first handler upon physical delivery to such cooperative.
    (8) Handler purchases watermelons from a producer's field for the 
purpose of preparing such watermelons for market or for transporting 
such watermelons to storage for subsequent handling. The handler who 
purchases such watermelons from the producer is the first handler.
    (9) Broker/Commission House receives watermelons from a producer and 
sells such watermelons in the Broker's/Commission House's name. In this 
instance, the Broker/Commission House is the first handler, regardless 
of whether the Broker/ Commission House took title to such watermelons.
    (10) Broker/Commission House, without taking title or possession of 
watermelons, sells such watermelons in the name of the producer. In this 
instance, the producer is the first handler.
    (11) Processor utilizes watermelons of own production in the 
manufacture of rind pickles, frozen, dehydrated, extracted, or canned 
products for human consumption. In so handling watermelons the processor 
is the first handler.
    (12) Processor purchases watermelons from the producer thereof. In 
this instance, the processor is the first handler even though the 
producer may have graded, packed, or otherwise handled such watermelons.
    (b) In the event of a handler's death, bankruptcy, receivership, or 
incapacity to act, the representative of the handler or the handler's 
estate shall be considered the handler of the watermelons for the 
purpose of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.518  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Time of payment. The assessment on domestically produced 
watermelons shall become due at the time the first handler handles the 
watermelons for non-exempt purposes. The assessment on imported 
watermelons shall become due at the time of entry, or withdrawal, into 
the United States.
    (b) Responsibility for payment. (1) The first handler is responsible 
for payment of both the producer's and the handler's assessment. The 
handler may collect the producer's assessment from the producer or 
deduct such producer's assessment from the proceeds paid to

[[Page 115]]

the producer on whose watermelons the producer assessment is made. Any 
such collection or deduction of producer assessment shall be made not 
later than the time when the first handler handles the watermelons.
    (2) The U.S. Customs Service shall collect assessments on imported 
watermelons from importers and forward such assessments under an 
agreement between the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Importers shall be responsible for payment of assessments 
directly to the Board of any assessments due but not collected by the 
U.S. Customs Service at the time of entry, or withdrawal, on watermelons 
imported into the United States for human consumption.
    (c) Payment direct to the Board. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b) and (e) of this section, each handler and importer shall remit the 
required producer and handler assessments, pursuant to Sec. 1210.341 of 
the Plan, directly to the Board not later than 30 days after the end of 
the month such assessments are due. Remittance shall be by check, draft, 
or money order payable to the National Watermelon Promotion Board, or 
NWPB, and shall be accompanied by a report, preferably on Board forms, 
pursuant to Sec. 1210.350. To avoid late payment charges, the 
assessments must be mailed to the Board and postmarked within 30 days 
after the end of the month such assessments are due.
    (2) Pursuant to Sec. 1210.350 of the Plan, each handler shall file 
with the Board a report for each month that assessable watermelons were 
handled. All handler reports shall contain at least the following 
information:
    (i) The handler's name, address, and telephone number;
    (ii) Date of report (which is also the date of payment to the 
Board);
    (iii) Period covered by the report;
    (iv) Total quantity of watermelons handled during the reporting 
period;
    (v) Date of last report remitting assessments to the Board; and
    (vi) Listing of all persons for whom the handler handled 
watermelons, their addresses, hundredweight handled, and total 
assessments remitted for each producer. In lieu of such a list, the 
handler may substitute copies of settlement sheets given to each person 
or computer generated reports, provided such settlement sheets or 
computer reports contain all the information listed above.
    (vii) Name, address, and hundredweight handled for each person 
claiming exemption for assessment.
    (viii) If the handler handled watermelons for persons engaged in the 
growing of less than 10 acres of watermelons, the report shall indicate 
the name and address of such person and the quantity of watermelons 
handled for such person.
    (3) The words ``final report'' shall be shown on the last report at 
the close of the handler's marketing season or at the end of each fiscal 
period if such handler markets assessable watermelons on a year-round 
basis.
    (4) Prepayment of assessments. (i) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
and reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Board 
may permit handlers to make an advance payment of their total estimated 
assessments for the crop year to the Board prior to their actual 
determination of assessable watermelons. The Board shall not be 
obligated to pay interest on any advance payment.
    (ii) Handlers using such procedures shall provide a final annual 
report of actual handling and remit any unpaid assessments not later 
than 30 days after the end of the last month of the designated handler's 
marketing season or at the end of each fiscal period if such handler 
markets assessable watermelons on a year-round basis.
    (iii) Handlers using such procedures shall, after filing a final 
annual report, receive a reimbursement of any overpayment of 
assessments.
    (iv) Handlers using such procedures shall, at the request of the 
Board to verify a producer's refund claim, provide the Board with a 
handling report on any and all producers for whom the handler has 
provided handling services but has not yet filed a handling report with 
the Board.
    (v) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board on request.
    (d) Late payment charges and interest. (1) A late payment charge 
shall be imposed on any handler and importer who

[[Page 116]]

fails to make timely remittance to the Board of the total producer and 
handler and importer assessments for which any such handler and importer 
is liable. Such late payment shall be imposed on any assessments not 
received before the fortieth day after the end of the month such 
assessments are due. This one-time late payment charge shall be 10 
percent of the assessments due before interest charges have accrued. The 
late payment charge will not be applied to any late payments postmarked 
within 30 days after the end of the month such assessments are due.
    (2) In addition to the late payment charge, one and one-half percent 
per month interest on the outstanding balance, including the late 
payment charge and any accrued interest, will be added to any accounts 
for which payment has not been received by the last day of the second 
month following the month of handling; Provided, that, handlers paying 
their assessments in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii), will not be 
subject to the one and one-half percent per month interest under this 
paragraph until the last day of the second month after such assessments 
are due under paragraph (c)(4)(ii). Such interest will continue monthly 
until the outstanding balance is paid to the Board.
    (e) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may enter into 
agreements, subject to approval of the Secretary, authorizing other 
organizations, such as a regional watermelon association or State 
watermelon board, to collect assessments in its behalf. In any State or 
area in which the Board has entered into such an agreement, the 
designated handler shall pay the assessment to such agency in the time 
and manner, and with such identifying information as specified in such 
agreement. Such an agreement shall not provide any cooperating agency 
with authority to collect confidential information from handlers or 
producers. To qualify, the cooperating agency must on its own accord 
have access to all information required by the Board for collection 
purposes. If the Board requires further evidence of payment than 
provided by the cooperating agency, it may acquire such evidence from 
individual handlers. All such agreements are subject to the requirements 
of the Act, Plan, and all applicable rules and regulations under the Act 
and the Plan.

Rockies to the Great Lakes and south to the Kansas/Missouri/Kentucky 
state line): Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and

produced over the previous three years. Average tonnage will be based 
upon North American Blueberry Council production figures for the initial 
election and production and assessment figures generated by the USACBC 
thereafter.
    (3) One importer and alternate.

producers currently shipping blueberries into the United States from the 
largest foreign blueberry production area, based on a three-year

Sec. 1218.53  Exemption procedures.

    (a) Any producer who produces less than 2,000 pounds of blueberries 
annually who desires to claim an exemption from assessments during a 
fiscal year as provided in Sec. 1218.42 shall apply to the USACBC, on a 
form provided by the USACBC, for a certificate of exemption. Such 
producer shall certify that the producer's production of blueberries 
shall be less than 2,000 pounds for the fiscal year for which the 
exemption is claimed. Any importer who imports less than 2,000 pounds of 
fresh and processed blueberries annually who desires to claim an 
exemption from assessments during a fiscal year as provided in 
Sec. 1218.52 shall apply to the USACBC, on a form provided by the 
USACBC, for a certificate of exemption. Such importer shall certify that 
the importer's importation of fresh and processed blueberries shall not 
exceed 2,000 pounds, for the fiscal year for which the exemption is 
claimed.
    (b) On receipt of an application, the USACBC shall determine whether 
an exemption may be granted. The USACBC then will issue, if deemed 
appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person who is eligible 
to receive one. Each producer who is exempt from

[[Page 156]]

assessment must provide an exemption number to the first handler in 
order to be exempt from the collection of an assessment on blueberries. 
First handlers and importers, except as otherwise authorized by the 
USACBC, shall maintain records showing the exemptee's name and address 
along with the exemption number assigned by the USACBC.
    (c) Importers who are exempt from assessment shall be eligible for 
reimbursement of assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service and 
shall apply to the USACBC for reimbursement of such assessments paid. No 
interest will be paid on assessments collected by the U.S. Customs 
Service. Requests for reimbursement shall be submitted to the USACBC 
within 90 days of the last day of the year the blueberries were actually 
imported.
    (d) Any person who desires an exemption from assessments for a 
subsequent fiscal year shall reapply to the USACBC, on a form provided 
by the USACBC, for a certificate of exemption.
    (e) The USACBC may require persons receiving an exemption from 
assessments to provide to the USACBC reports on the disposition of 
exempt blueberries and, in the case of importers, proof of payment of 
assessments.

    (1) The establishment, issuance, effectuation, and administration of 
appropriate programs for promotion, research, and information, including 
producer and consumer information, with respect to fresh and processed 
blueberries; and
    (2) The establishment and conduct of research with respect to the 
use, nutritional value, sale, distribution, and marketing of fresh and 
processed blueberries, and the creation of new products thereof, to the 
end that the marketing and use of blueberries may be encouraged, 
expanded, improved, or made more acceptable and to advance the image, 
desirability, or quality of fresh and processed blueberries.
    (b) No program, plan, or project shall be implemented prior to its 
approval by the Secretary. Once a program, plan, or project is so 
approved, the USACBC shall take appropriate steps to implement it.
    (c) Each program, plan, or project implemented under this subpart 
shall be reviewed or evaluated periodically by the USACBC to ensure that 
it contributes to an effective program of promotion, research, or 
information. If it is found by the USACBC that any such program, plan, 
or project does not contribute to an effective program of promotion, 
research, or information, then the USACBC shall terminate such program, 
plan, or project.
    (d) No program, plan, or project including advertising shall be 
false or misleading or disparaging another agricultural commodity. 
Blueberries of all origins shall be treated equally.

    (a) A Hass Avocado Board, called the Board elsewhere in this part, 
is hereby established to administer the terms and provisions of this 
subpart. The Board shall consist of 12 members nominated by the Hass 
avocado industry and appointed by the Secretary as provided in this 
subpart, each of whom shall have an alternate nominated and appointed in 
the same manner as members of the Board are nominated and appointed. 
Board members and alternates shall be domiciled in the United States.
    (b) The membership of the Board shall be divided as follows:
    (1) Seven members and their alternates shall be producers of Hass 
avocados that are subject to assessments under this subpart;
    (2) Two members and their alternates shall be importers of Hass 
avocados that are subject to assessments under this subpart; and

[[Page 165]]

    (3) Three members shall be producers of Hass avocados that are 
subject to assessments under this subpart or importers of Hass avocados 
that are subject to assessments under this subpart. Producers and 
importers shall be allocated to these positions so as to assure as 
nearly as possible that the composition of the 12-member Board reflects 
the proportion of domestic production and imports supplying the United 
States market. Such proportion shall be based on the Secretary's 
determination of the average volume of domestic production and the 
average volume of imports into the United States market over the 
previous three years, based on all information available to the 
Secretary.
    (c) Three years after the assessment of funds commences pursuant to 
this subpart, and at the end of each three-year period thereafter, the 
Board shall review the production of domestic Hass avocados in the 
United States and the volume of imported Hass avocados on the basis of 
the amount of assessments collected from producers and importers over 
the immediately preceding three-year period and, if warranted, recommend 
to the Secretary the reapportionment of the positions authorized in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section to reflect changes in the proportion of 
domestic Hass avocado production to the volume of imported Hass 
avocados, to the extent possible in the Act. Any adjustment under this 
paragraph shall be subject to the review and approval of the Secretary.
    (d) For purposes of this section, importer means a person who is

imposed on the outstanding amount for which the handler is liable. The 
rate of interest shall be prescribed by the Secretary. The timeliness of 
a payment to the Board shall be based on the date the payment is 
actually received by the Board.

addition, such funds and any proceeds from the investment of such funds 
shall be used by the importer association to finance promotion, 
research, consumer information, and industry information programs, 
plans, and projects in the United States. However, no such funds shall 
be used for any administrative expenses incurred by the importer 
association.
    (m) In general, assessment funds received by the Board shall be

of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the net market price of the 
soybeans purchased. Each first purchaser shall remit such assessment to 
the Board or to a Qualified State Soybean Board, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (2) Any producer marketing processed soybeans or soybean products of 
that producer's own production, shall remit to a Qualified State Soybean 
Board or to the Board, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
an assessment on such soybeans or soybean products at a rate of one-half 
of one percent (0.5%) of the net market price of the soybeans involved 
or the equivalent thereof.
    (3) In determining the assessment due from each producer under 
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, a producer who is 
contributing to a Qualified State Soybean Board shall receive a credit 
from the Board for contributions to such Qualified State Soybean Board 
on any soybeans assessed under this section in an amount not to exceed 
one-quarter of one percent of the net market price of the soybeans 
assessed.
    (4) In order for a producer to receive the credit provided for in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Qualified State Soybean Board or

in a State other than the State which is the situs of the first 
purchaser, the first purchaser that collects the assessment shall remit 
the assessment and information as to the State of origin of the soybeans 
to the Qualified State Soybean Board operating in the State in which the 
first purchaser is located. The Qualified State Soybean Board operating 
in the State in which the first purchaser is located shall remit such 
assessments to the Qualified State Soybean Board operating in the State 
in which the soybeans were grown. If no such Qualified State Soybean 
Board exists in such State, then the assessments shall be remitted to 
the Board. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may authorize 
Qualified State Soybean Boards to propose modifications to the foregoing 
``State of Origin'' rule to ensure effective coordination of assessment 
collections between Qualified State Soybean Boards.
    (ii)(A) If a producer pledges soybeans grown by that producer as 
collateral for a loan issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation and if 
that producer forfeits said soybeans in lieu of loan repayment, the 
Commodity Credit Corporation shall at the time of the loan settlement, 
collect from the producer the assessments due based on 0.5 percent of 
the principal loan amount received by the producer and remit the 
assessment to the Qualified State Soybean Board in the State in which 
the soybeans were pledged, or if no Qualified State Soybean Board exists 
in such State, the Board.
    (B) If a producer redeems and subsequently markets soybeans which 
have been pledged as collateral for a loan issued by the Commodity 
Credit Corporation, the first purchaser shall collect and remit the 
assessments due pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or if a 
producer markets such soybeans as processed soybeans or as soybean 
products, the producer shall remit the assessment pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Qualified State Soybean Boards and the Board shall coordinate 
assessment collection procedures to ensure that producers marketing 
soybeans are required to pay only one assessment per bushel of soybeans 
and collections are adjusted among States on a mutually agreeable basis.

[[Page 191]]

    (b) The collection of assessments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, shall commence on and after the date assessments are required

collected, the Secretary shall have the authority to receive the 
assessments on behalf of the Board, and to hold such assessments until 
the Board is constituted, then remit such assessments to the Board.

    (a) Each State association shall receive on a monthly basis, a 
percentage determined by the Delegate Body or 16.5 percent, whichever is

assessments attributable to a State is the total amount of assessments 
received from producers in a State.
    (b) A State association which was conducting a pork promotion 
program in the period from July 1, 1984 to June 30, 1985, shall receive 
additional amounts at such times as the Board may determine, so that the 
total amount received on an annual basis would be equal to the amount 
that would have been collected in such State pursuant to the pork 
promotion program in existence in such State from July 1, 1984, to June 
30, 1985, had the porcine animals subject to assessment, been produced 
from July 1, 1984, to June 30, 1985, and been subject to the rates of 
assessment then in effect from such State to the Council and other 
national entities involved in pork promotion, research, and consumer 
information. This paragraph shall apply to a State association only if 
the annual amount determined under this paragraph would be greater than 
the annual amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The Council shall receive on a monthly basis 35 percent of the 
net assessments until after the referendum is conducted, and 25 percent 
thereafter and until 12 months after the referendum.

consumer information program in years when assessment amounts may be 
reduced; and

person from the Board, such person shall be notified of the amount due. 
Any amount due the Board shall be remitted to the Board by the next date

rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. For 
the purpose of this section, any assessment that was determined at a 
date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a person's failure 
to submit a report to the Board when due shall be considered to have 
been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been 
filed when due. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based 
on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the 
Board, whichever is earlier.

wants to vote whether as an individual or as a representative of a 
corporation or other entity shall register during the 3-day in-person 
voting period at the county FSA office where FSA maintains and processes 
the individual producer's or corporation's or other entities' 
administrative farm records. A producer voting as an individual or as a 
representative of a corporation or other entity not participating in FSA 
programs, shall register and vote in the county FSA office serving the 
county where the individual producer or corporation or other entity owns 
hogs or pigs. An individual or an authorized representative of a 
corporation or other entity who owns hogs or pigs in more than one 
county shall register and vote in the FSA county office where the 
individual or corporation or other entity does most of their business. 
Producers shall be required to record on the In-Person Voter 
Registration List (Form LS-75) their name and address, and if 
applicable, the name and address of the corporation or other entity they 
represent before they can receive a registration form and ballot. To 
register, producers shall complete the in-person registration and 
certification form (Form LS-72-2) and certify that:
    (i) They or the corporation or other entity they represent were 
producers during the specified representative period; and
    (ii) The person voting on behalf of a corporation or other entity 
referred to in Sec. 1230.612 is authorized to do so.
    (2) Each eligible producer who has not voted by means of an absentee 
ballot may cast a ballot in-person at the location and time set forth in 
Sec. 1230.625 and on September 19, 20, 21, 2000. Eligible producers who 
record their names and addresses and, if applicable, the name and 
address of the corporation or other entity they are authorized to 
represent on the In-Person Voter Registration List (Form LS-75) will 
receive a combined registration and certification form printed on an 
envelope (Form LS-72-2) and a ballot (Form LS-72). Producers will enter 
the information requested on the combined registration and certification 
form/envelope (Form LS-72-2) as indicated above. Producers will then 
mark their ballots to indicate ``yes'' or ``no.'' Producers will place 
their completed ballots in an envelope marked ``Pork Ballot'' (Form LS-
72-1), seal and place it in the completed and signed registration form/
envelope marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-72-2), seal that envelope 
and personally place it in a box marked ``Ballot Box'' or other 
designated receptacle. Voting will be conducted on-site under the

marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-73-1) by mail, telephone, facsimile, 
or by picking up one in-person from the county FSA office where FSA 
maintains and processes the producer's administrative farm records.
    (2) If a producer, whether requesting an absentee ballot as an 
individual or as an authorized representative of a corporation or other 
entity that does not participate in FSA programs, and therefore does not 
have administrative records at a county FSA office, he or she may 
request an absentee voting package by telephone, mail, facsimile, or 
pick it up in-person from the county FSA office serving the county where 
the individual or corporation or other entity owns hogs or pigs. An 
individual or authorized representative of a corporation or other 
entity, who owns hogs or pigs in more than one county can request an 
absentee ballot from the county FSA office where the producer

[[Page 222]]

or corporation or other entity does most of their business.
    (3) An absentee voting package will be mailed to producers by the 
FSA CED to the address provided by the prospective voter. Only one 
absentee registration form and absentee ballot will be provided to each 
eligible producer. The absentee ballots and registration forms may be 
requested during August 1, 2000, through September 18, 2000.
    (4) The county FSA office will enter on the Absentee Voter Request 
List (Form LS-74) the name and address of the individual or corporation 
or other entity requesting an absentee ballot and the date the forms 
were requested.

    (i) They or the corporation or other entity they represent were 
producers during the specified representative period;

combined registration and absentee ballot form (Form LS-73) and seal the 
completed ballot in a separate envelope marked ``Pork Ballot'' (Form LS-
72-1) and place the sealed ``Pork Ballot'' envelope in the mailing 
envelope marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-73-1) along with the signed 
registration form. Producers are required to print their name and 
address on the mailing envelope marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-73-
1), and mail or hand deliver it to the county FSA office from which the 
producer or corporation or other entity obtained the absentee voting 
package. Absentee ballots returned in-person must be received by close 
of business on the last day of the in-person voting period, which is 
September 21, 2000. Ballots received after that date will be counted as 
invalid ballots.
    (7) Absentee ballots returned by mail have to be postmarked with a 
date not later than the last day of the in-person voting period, which 
is September 21, 2000, and be received in the county FSA office by the 
close of business on the 5th business day after the last day of the in-
person voting period, which is September 28, 2000. Absentee ballots 
received after that date will be counted as invalid ballots. Upon 
receiving the ``Pork Referendum'' envelope (Form LS-73-1) containing the 
registration form and ballot, the county FSA CED will record the date 
the ``Pork Referendum'' envelope (Form LS-73-1) containing the absentee 
ballot was received in the FSA county office on the Absentee Voter 
Request List (Form LS-74) opposite the name of the producer voting

[[Page 225]]

Absentee Voter Request List (FormLS-74), respectively, to determine 
properly registered voters. The ballots of producers voting in-person 
whose names are not on the In-Person Voter Registration List (Form LS-

envelopes, FSA county employees will open them and count the ballots.

name and address is not recorded on the Absentee Voter Request List 
(Form LS-74), or the registration form or ballot was incomplete or 
incorrectly completed.
    (3) Spoiled ballots. Ballots will be considered spoiled if they are 
mutilated or marked in such a way that it cannot be determined whether 
the voter is voting ``yes'' or ``no.'' Spoiled ballots shall not be

the in-person voting period. FSA headquarter office employees will 
remove the sealed ``Pork Ballot'' envelope (Form LS-72-1) from the 
``Pork Referendum'' envelopes (Form LS-73-1) of all eligible importer 
voters. After removing all ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes, FSA headquarter 
employees will shuffle the sealed ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes or otherwise 
mix them up so that ballots cannot be matched with importers' names. 
After shuffling the ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes, FSA headquarters 
employees will open the envelopes and count the ballots. The ballots 
will be counted as follows:
    (i) Number of eligible importers casting valid ballots;

completed.
    (3) Spoiled ballots. Ballots will be considered spoiled if they were

the voter is voting ``yes'' or ``no.'' Spoiled ballots shall not be 
considered as a ballot cast in the referendum.

per month interest on the outstanding balance except as otherwise 
authorized by the Board, will be added to any accounts delinquent over 
30 days and will continue monthly until the outstanding balance is paid 
to the Board.

Sec. 1240.116  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Responsibility for payment. Unless otherwise authorized by the 
Board under the Act and Order, the first handler or producer-packer 
shall collect the assessment from the producer, or deduct such 
assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer on whose honey the 
assessment is made, and remit the assessments to the Board. The first 
handler or producer-packer shall furnish the producer with evidence of 
such payment. Any such collection or deduction of assessment shall be 
made not later than the time when the assessment becomes payable to the 
Board. Failure of the handler or producer-packer to collect or deduct 
such assessment does not relieve the handler or producer-packer of his 
or her obligation to remit the assessment to the Board. However, should 
a first handler or the Secretary fail to collect an assessment from a 
producer, the producer shall be responsible for the payment of the 
assessment to the Board. Assessments on imported honey and honey 
products shall be collected as specified in Sec. 1240.115(e); Provided, 
That importers shall be responsible for

[[Page 245]]

payment of any assessment amount not collected by the U.S. Customs 
Service at the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the 
United States.
    (b) Payment directly to the Board. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, each first handler and producer-packer shall pay 
the required assessment pursuant to Sec. 1240.41 of the Order directly 
to the Board at the address referenced in Sec. 1240.106, for each 
reporting period specified in Sec. 1240.119, on or before the 15th day 
following the end of such period. Payment shall be in the form of a 
check, draft, or money order payable to the Board and shall be 
accompanied by a report on Board forms pursuant to Sec. 1240.50.
    (c) Prepayment of assessment. (1) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
payment specified in Sec. 1240.119 of this subpart, the Board may permit 
first handlers or producer-packers to make advance payments of their 
total estimated assessments for the season to the Board prior to their 
actual determination of assessable honey.
    (2) Persons using such procedure shall provide a monthly accounting 
of actual handling and assessments.
    (3) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board upon request.
    (d) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may enter into 
agreements subject to approval of the Secretary authorizing other 
organizations to collect assessments in its behalf. All such agreements 
are subject to the requirements of the Act, Order, and all applicable 
rules and regulations under the Act and the Order.

Sec. 1250.356  Certification of organizations.

    Any organization may request the Secretary for certification of 
eligibility to participate in nominating members and alternate members 
on the Board to represent the geographic area in which the organization 
represents egg producers. Such eligibility shall be based in addition to 
other available information upon a factual report submitted by the 
organization which shall contain information deemed relevant and 
specified by the Secretary for the making of such determination, 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) Geographic territory covered by the organization's active 
membership;
    (b) Nature and size of the organization's active membership, 
proportion of total of such active membership accounted for by producers 
of commercial eggs, a chart showing the egg production by State in which 
the organization has members, and the volume of commercial eggs produced 
by the organization's active membership in such State(s);

derived;
    (f) Functions of the organization; and

and objectives of the act.

The primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an 
organization shall be whether its egg producer membership consists of a 
substantial number of egg producers who produce a substantial volume of 
the applicable geographic area's commercial eggs to reasonably warrant 
its participation in the nomination of members for the Board or to 
request the issuance of an order. The Secretary shall certify any 
organization which he finds to be eligible under this section and his 
determination as to eligibility shall be final.

[55 FR 6974, Feb. 28, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 64560, Dec. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1250.515  Reporting period and payment.

    (a) For the purpose of the payment of assessments, either a calendar 
month or a 4-week accounting period shall be considered the reporting 
period; however, other accounting periods may be used when approved by 
the Board on an individual basis. Each collecting handler shall register 
his reporting period with the Board. All changes in reporting periods 
shall be requested in writing and subject to approval by the Board.
    (b) Each producer shall pay the required assessment on his 
commercial eggs pursuant to Sec. 1250.514 to the collecting handler 
designated in Sec. 1250.516 on or before the date of final settlement 
between the producer and the collecting handler for the eggs received by 
the collecting handler during each reporting period.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.516  Collecting handlers and collection.

    (a) Handlers responsible for collecting the assessments shall be any 
of the following:
    (1) The first person to whom eggs are sold, consigned, or delivered 
by producers and who grades, cartons, or breaks such eggs. Such shell 
egg breaker or egg packer must collect and remit to the Board the 
assessments on all eggs handled except eggs for which there is a 
certification of exemption or eggs for which there is a statement 
indicating that an assessment has already been paid;
    (2) A person who buys or receives nest run eggs from a producer and 
who does not grade, carton, or break such eggs. Such person shall 
collect the assessment from the producer and remit to the Egg Board on 
all such eggs, except for which there is a certification of exemption or 
eggs for which there is a statement indicating that an assessment has 
already been paid;
    (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, a producer who grades, cartons, or breaks eggs of his own 
production shall be responsible for remitting the assessment to the 
Board on all eggs produced. This would include the eggs which he grades, 
cartons, or breaks as well as the nest run eggs which are graded,

[[Page 262]]

cartoned, or broken by another handler. Such a producer who remits the 
assessment on nest run eggs to the Board shall provide the handler 
specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section with a written 
statement that the assessment has already been paid on the nest run 
eggs; or
    (4) Upon approval of the Board, any person who handles eggs for a 
producer under a written contract that includes express provisions that 
said handler will remit the assessment on such eggs to the Board shall 
be the collecting handler notwithstanding the fact that the producer may 
have graded, cartoned, or otherwise processed the eggs.
    Following are some examples to aid in identification of collecting 
handlers:
    (i) Producer sells, assigns, consigns, or otherwise delivers nest 
run eggs of his own production to a shell egg packer or breaker for 
preparation for market--the shell egg packer or breaker is the 
collecting handler and is responsible for remitting to the Egg Board;
    (ii) Producer grades, cartons, breaks, or otherwise prepares for 
marketing a portion of the eggs of his own production and delivers the 
remaining portion of his nest run eggs to a shell egg packer or breaker-
-the producer is the collecting handler and shall remit the assessment 
on his total production to the Board;
    (iii) Producer sells all or a portion of his eggs in nest run form 
to a handler who is not a shell egg packer or breaker--the handler is 
responsible for collecting the assessment and remitting it to the Egg 
Board except for eggs covered by a statement indicating that an 
assessment has already been paid;
    (iv) A shell egg packer or breaker who buys or receives nest run 
eggs from a handler who is not a shell egg packer or breaker--the 
handler is the collecting handler and shall remit such assessment to the 
Board;
    (v) A shell egg packer or egg breaker buys nest run or graded eggs 
including undergrade eggs from another shell egg packer or egg breaker--
the first shell egg packer or breaker is the collecting handler and 
shall remit such assessments to the Board.
    (b) In the event of a producer's death, bankruptcy, receivership, or 
incapacity to act, the representative of the producer or his estate, or 
the person acting on behalf of creditors, shall be considered the 
producer of the eggs for the purpose of this subpart.
    (c) The collecting handler may collect the assessment directly from 
the producer or deduct the assessment from the proceeds due or paid to 
the producer on whose eggs the assessment is made.

[41 FR 22925, June 8, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 60724, Nov. 29, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1250.517  Remittance to Egg Board.

    (a) The collecting handler responsible for remittance of assessments 
to the Board is not relieved of this obligation as a result of his 
failure to collect payment of the assessment from the egg producer(s).
    (b) Each collecting handler required to remit the assessments on the 
eggs handled during each reporting period, specified in 
Sec. 1250.515(a), shall remit the assessments directly to the Egg Board 
by check, draft, or money order payable to the Egg Board on or before 
the 15th day after the end of said reporting period together with a 
report pursuant to Sec. 1250.529. The assessment for each reporting 
period shall be calculated on the basis of the gross volume of eggs 
subject to assessment received by the collecting handler during each 
reporting period.
    (c) Remittance through cooperating agency.
    (1) In any State or specified geographic area the Egg Board, with 
the approval of the Secretary, may designate by agreement a cooperating 
agency to collect the assessments in its behalf. Every collecting 
handler within such a State or geographic area shall remit the 
assessments for each reporting period, specified in Sec. 1250.515(a), to 
the designated cooperating agency by check, draft, or money order 
payable to said cooperating agency on or before the 15th day after the 
end of said reporting period together with a report pursuant to 
Sec. 1250.529.
    (2) On or before the 20th day after the end of each reporting 
period, each designated cooperating agency shall remit to the Egg Board 
the total amount of

[[Page 263]]

all assessments received from collecting handlers for said reporting 
period together with all collecting handler reports. In addition, each 
designated cooperating agency shall submit to the Egg Board such 
information as is required by the designation agreement with the Egg 
Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.518  Receipts for payment of assessments.

    (a) Each collecting handler shall give each producer whose eggs are 
subject to assessment a receipt for the commercial eggs handled by said 
collecting handler showing payment of the assessment. This receipt may 
be on a separate receipt form or included as part of the invoice or 
settlement sheet for the eggs, but in either event shall contain the 
following information:
    (1) Name, address, and identification number of the collecting 
handler;
    (2) Name and address of the producer who paid the assessment;
    (3) Number of cases of eggs on which assessment was paid and the 
total amount of the assessment; and
    (4) Date on which assessment was paid by producer.
    (b) All eggs sold, consigned, or delivered from a collecting handler 
to another handler, excluding cartoned eggs and loose graded eggs sold 
to the bakeries, restaurants, and institutions, shall be accompanied 
with the collecting handler's written statement that the assessment on 
the lot of eggs covered by the invoice has been paid or that lot of eggs 
or portion thereof is exempt from assessment under provisions of 
Sec. 1250.514.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.519  Late-payment charge.

    Any unpaid assessments due to the Board pursuant to Sec. 1250.347 
shall be increased by a late-payment charge of 1.5 percent each month 
beginning with the day following the date such assessments are 30 days 
past due. Any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid 
charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at 
the same rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until 
paid. Assessments that are not paid when due because of a person's 
failure to submit a handler report to the Board as required shall accrue 
late-payment charges from the time such assessments should have been 
remitted. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based on the 
applicable postmark date or the date payment is actually received by the 
Board, whichever is earlier.

head of cattle and such unit(s) shall be entitled to at least one 
representative on the Board;
    (3) Importers shall be represented by a single unit, with the number 
of Board members representing such unit based upon a conversion of the 
total volume of imported cattle, beef or beef products into live animal 
equivalencies;
    (4) Each unit shall be entitled to representation by an additional 
Board member for each one million (1,000,000) head of cattle within the 
unit which exceeds the initial five hundred thousand (500,000) head of 
cattle within the unit qualifying such unit for representation.

and the Secretary shall utilize the information received by the Board

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1260.172  Assessments.

    (a) Domestic assessments. (1) Except as prescribed by regulations 
approved by the Secretary, each person making payment to a producer for 
cattle purchased from such producer shall be a collecting person and 
shall collect an assessment from the producer, and each producer shall 
pay such assessment to the collecting person, at the rate of one dollar 
($1) per head of cattle purchased and such collecting person shall remit 
the assessment to the Board or to a qualified State beef council 
pursuant to Sec. 1260.172(a)(5).
    (2) Any producer marketing cattle of that producer's own production 
in the form of beef or beef products to consumers, either directly or 
through retail or wholesale outlets, or for export purposes, shall remit 
to a qualified State beef council or to the Board an assessment on such 
cattle at the rate of one dollar ($1) per head of cattle or the 
equivalent thereof.
    (3) In determining the assessment due from each producer pursuant to 
Sec. 1260.172(a), a producer who is contributing to a qualified State 
beef council(s) shall receive a credit from the Board for contributions 
to such Council, but not to exceed 50 cents per head of cattle assessed.
    (4) In order for a producer described in Sec. 1260.172(a) to receive 
the credit authorized in Sec. 1260.172(a)(3), the qualified State beef 
council or the collecting person must establish to the satisfaction of 
the Board that the producer has contributed to a qualified State beef 
council.
    (5) Each person responsible for the remittance of the assessment 
pursuant to Sec. 1260.172 (a) (1) and (2) shall remit the assessment to 
the qualified State beef council in the State from which the cattle 
originated prior to sale, or if there is no qualified State beef council 
within such State, the assessment shall be remitted directly to the 
Board. However, the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may 
authorize qualified State beef councils to propose modifications to the 
foregoing ``State of origin'' rule to ensure effective coordination of 
assessment collections between qualified State beef councils. Qualified 
State beef councils and the Board shall coordinate assessment collection 
procedures to ensure that producers selling or marketing cattle in 
interstate commerce are required to pay only one assessment per 
individual sale of cattle. For the purpose of this subpart, ``State of 
origin'' rule means the State where the cattle were located at time of 
sale, or the State in which the cattle were located prior to sale if 
such cattle were transported interstate for the sole purpose of sale. 
Assessments shall be remitted not later than the 15th day of the month 
following the month in which the cattle were purchased or marketed.
    (6) If a State law or regulation promulgated pursuant to State law 
requires the payment and collection of a mandatory, nonrefundable 
assessment of more fifty (50) cents per head on the sale and purchase of 
cattle, or the equivalent thereof for beef and beef products as 
described in Sec. 1260.172 (a)(1) and (2) for use by a qualified State 
beef council to fund activities similar to those described in 
Sec. 1260.169, and such State law or regulation authorizes the issuance 
of a credit of that amount of the assessment which exceeds fifty (50) 
cents to producers who waive any right to the refund of the assessment 
credited by the State due pursuant to this subpart, then any producer 
subject to such State law or regulation who pays only the amount due 
pursuant to such State law or regulation and this subpart, including any 
credits issued, shall thereby waive that producer's right to receipt 
from the Board of a refund of such assessment for that portion of such 
refund for which the producer received credit pursuant to such State law 
or regulation.
    (b) Importer assessments. (1) Importers of cattle, beef, and beef 
products into the United States shall pay an assessment to the Board 
through the U.S. Customs Service, or in such other manner as may be 
established by regulations approved by the Secretary.

[[Page 276]]

products are as follows:

assessments which are equivalent to the producer's proportionate share 
of the proceeds.
    (c) Failure of the collecting person to collect the assessment on 
each head of cattle sold as designated in Sec. 1260.311 shall not 
relieve the producer of his obligation to pay the assessment to the 
appropriate qualified State beef council or the Cattlemen's Board as 
required in Sec. 1260.312.


<R05>
Sec. 1260.311  Collecting persons for purposes of collection of assessments.

section, each person making payment to a producer for cattle purchased 
in the United States shall collect from the producer an assessment at

remitting assessments to the QSBC or the Board as provided in 
Sec. 1260.312. The collecting person shall collect the assessment at the 
time the collecting person makes payment or any credit to the producer's 
account for the cattle purchased. The person paying the producer shall

a producer marketing cattle of the producer's own production in the form 
of beef or beef products shall be considered a collecting person.

    (c) Failure to collect. Failure of a person to collect the 
assessment on lambs purchased from a producer, feeder, or seedstock 
producer shall not relieve the producer, feeder, or seedstock producer 
of their obligation to pay the assessment and to remit the assessment to 
the Secretary.
    (d) Death, bankruptcy, receivership or incapacity to act. In the 
event of a producer's, feeder's, seedstock producer's, or exporter's 
death, bankruptcy, receivership or incapacity to act, the representative 
of such producer's, feeder's, seedstock producer's, or exporter's 
estate, the person acting on behalf of creditors or other person acting 
in such person's stead, shall be considered the producer, feeder, or 
seedstock producer and shall be required to pay an assessment or collect 
an assessment.
    (e) Remittance of assessments. (1) Assessments shall be remitted to 
the Lamb Promotion, Research, and Information Program, c/o the Secretary 
at USDA, 23029 Network Place, Chicago, Illinois 60673-1230, with a 
``Monthly Remittance Report'' form LS-81 not later than the 15th day of 
the following month in which lambs or lamb products were purchased for 
slaughter or export, or marketed, if a first handler markets lambs or 
lamb products directly to consumers, in order to avoid late payment 
charges.
    (2) In cases where a producer or feeder sells lambs as part of a 
custom slaughter operation, the producer or feeder shall be responsible 
for remitting the assessments pursuant to Sec. 1280.219.
    (3) Each person processing or causing to be processed lamb or lamb 
products of that person's own production and marketing such lamb or lamb 
products shall be responsible for remitting the assessments pursuant to 
Sec. 1280.217(c).
    (4) Late payment charges. Any unpaid assessments due to the Board 
pursuant to Sec. 1280.217 shall be increased 2 percent each month 
beginning with the day following the date such assessments were due. Any 
remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges previously 
made pursuant to this paragraph, shall be increased at the same rate on 
the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. Any 
assessment received at a date later than the date prescribed by this 
part, because of a persons failure to submit a timely report to the 
Secretary, shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would 
have been due if the report had been filed in a timely manner. The 
timeliness of a payment to the Secretary shall be based on the 
applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the Secretary, 
whichever is earlier.
    (5) Weekends and holidays. If the 15th day of the month falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or a federally recognized holiday then the required 
reports and assessment will be due the next business day in order to 
avoid late payment charges.
    (f) Non-producer status for certain transactions. (1) Each person 
seeking non-producer status pursuant to Sec. 1280.217 shall provide the 
person remitting the assessment a Statement of Certification of Non-
Producer Status form (LS-78).
    (2) A copy of the Statement of Certification of Non-Producer Status 
shall be forwarded by the person collecting the assessment to the 
Secretary.

authority over such organization.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.109  Changes in farming operations.

    Any change in a farming operation that would increase the number of

substantive. If bona fide, the following shall be considered to be 
substantive changes in the farming operation:
    (a) The addition of a family member to a farming operation in

circumstances involving individuals who have died or become 
incapacitated during the program year or fiscal year, as applicable. If 
the individual dies or is incapacitated before a determination is made 
that the individual is ``actively engaged in farming,'' the 
representative of the deceased individual's estate or the incapacitated 
individual, or other person if necessary, must provide the determining 
authority information to verify that such individual did make a 
conscious effort to and would have been determined to be actively 
engaged in farming if not for the individual's death or incapacitation. 
If the individual dies or is incapacitated after being determined to be 
``actively engaged in farming,'' the determining authority shall allow 
such determination to be in effect for that program year or fiscal year, 
as applicable. However, the following year such individual or the 
individual's estate must meet all necessary requirements in order to be 
determined to be ``actively engaged in farming'' for that year.

<R04>
                      Subpart D--Permitted Entities


<R05>
Sec. 1400.301  Limitation on the number of entities through which an individual or entity may receive a payment and required notification.

    (a) An individual may receive a payment under a program specified in 
Sec. 1400.1(a) either directly or indirectly from no more than three 
permitted entities. An individual who receives such a payment shall 
notify the county committee in the county in which such individual 
maintains a farming operation whether or not the farming operation is to 
be considered a permitted entity. An individual may only receive such 
payments as a result of a farming operation conducted by:
    (1) The individual and by no more than two entities in which the 
individual holds a substantial beneficial interest; or
    (2) No more than three entities in which the individual holds a 
substantial beneficial interest.
    (b) Except for entities specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
each entity entering into a contract or agreement under a program 
specified in Sec. 1400.1(a) shall, by the date the contract or agreement 
is submitted to the county committee, notify in writing:
    (1) Each individual or other entity that acquires or holds an 
interest in such entity of the requirements and limitations provided in 
this part; and
    (2) The county committee of the name and social security number of 
each individual and the name and taxpayer identification number of each 
entity that holds or acquires a substantial beneficial interest in such 
entity.
    (c) Entities shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this section if, as determined by the Deputy Administrator:
    (1) Because of the number of members of such entity no member is 
likely to have a substantial beneficial interest in such entity; and
    (2) Such provisions would cause undue financial hardship on such 
entity.
    (d)(1) An individual or entity that holds a substantial beneficial 
interest in more than the number of permitted entities specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section for which a contract or agreement has been 
submitted to the county committee shall notify the county committee in 
writing, in each county in which they conduct a farming operation, of 
those entities that shall be considered as permitted entities by a date 
as determined by the Deputy Administrator following the date the 
contract or agreement was submitted to the county committee.
    (2) The remaining entities in which the individual or entity holds a 
substantial beneficial interest shall be notified that such entity is 
subject to reductions in the payments earned by the remaining entity. 
Such a reduction shall be made in an amount that bears the same 
relationship to the full payment that the individual's interest in the 
entity bears to all interests in the entity. The remaining entity's 
members shall have the opportunity to adjust among themselves their 
proportionate shares of the program benefits in the designated entity or 
entities before such reductions are made.
    (e) If an individual or entity fails to make such a notification as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section, all entities in which the 
individual or entity holds a substantial beneficial interest shall be 
subject to a reduction in payments in the manner specified in paragraph 
(d)(2).


<R04>
                      Subpart E--Cash Rent Tenants


<R05>
Sec. 1400.401  Eligibility.

    (a) Any tenant that is actively engaged in farming in accordance 
with the provisions of subpart C and conducts a farming operation in 
which the tenant rents the land for cash, for a crop share guaranteed as 
to the amount of the commodity, or by any arrangement in which the 
tenant does not compensate the landlord by cash or a crop share, and 
receives benefits, with respect to such land under a program specified 
in Sec. 1400.1(a) shall be ineligible to receive any payment with 
respect to such cash-rented land unless the tenant makes a significant 
contribution to the farming operation of:
    (1) Active personal labor; or
    (2) Active personal management and equipment. If such equipment is 
leased by the tenant from:

[[Page 319]]

    (i) The landlord, the lease must reflect the fair market value of 
the equipment leased; and
    (ii) The same individual or entity that is providing hired labor to 
the farming operation, the contracts for the lease of the equipment and 
for the hired labor must be two separate contracts that reflect the fair 
market value of the leased equipment and the hired labor and the tenant 
must exercise complete control over the use of a significant amount of 
the equipment during the current crop year.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R04>
                       Subpart F-- Foreign Persons


<R05>
Sec. 1400.501  Eligibility.

    (a) Any person who is not a citizen of the United States or a lawful 
alien shall be ineligible to receive payments, loans and benefits, with 
respect to any commodity produced, or land set aside from production, on 
a farm that is owned or operated by such person unless such person is an 
individual who is providing land, capital, and a substantial amount of 
active personal labor on such farm.
    (b)(1) A corporation or other entity shall be ineligible to receive 
payments, loan, and benefits if more than 10 percent of the beneficial 
ownership of the entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the 
United States or lawful aliens unless each foreign individual who is a 
stockholder or other type of member provides a substantial amount of 
active personal labor in the production of crops on a farm owned or 
operated by such an entity. However, upon the written request of the 
entity, the Deputy Administrator may make payments in an amount 
determined by the Deputy Administrator to be representative of the 
percentage interest of the entity that is owned by citizens of the 
United States and lawful aliens or foreign stockholders or other type of 
member who provide a significant contribution of active personal labor 
in the production of crops on a farm owned or operated by such entity.
    (2) In determining whether more than 10 percent of the beneficial 
ownership of an entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the 
United States or by lawful aliens, the beneficial ownership interest 
shall be the higher of the amount of such interest on:
    (i) The date the applicable program contract or agreement is 
executed by the entity; or
    (ii) Any other date prior to the final harvest date that is 
determined and announced by the Deputy Administrator to be normal in the 
area for the applicable program crop.
    (3) A corporation or other entity shall inform the county committee 
of any increase in such ownership that occurs after the applicable 
program contract or agreement is executed.
    (4) In the event of an increase in such ownership after a payment, 
loan, or benefit has been made, the entity shall refund such payment, 
loan, or benefit.
    (5) Where there is only one class of stock or other similar unit of 
ownership, an individual's or entity's percentage share of the limited 
partnership, corporation or other similar entity shall be based upon the 
outstanding shares of stock or other similar unit of ownership held by 
the individual or entity and compared to the total outstanding shares of 
stock or other similar unit of ownership. If the limited partnership, 
corporation or other similar entity has more than one class of stock or 
other unit of ownership, the percentage share of the limited 
partnership, corporation or other similar entity owned by an individual 
or entity shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on the basis 
of market quotations. If market quotations are lacking or are too scarce 
to be recognized, such percentage share shall be determined by the 
Deputy Administrator on the basis of all relevant factors affecting the 
fair market value of such stock or other unit of ownership, including 
the various rights and privileges that are attributed to each such 
class.
    (c) A citizen of the United States, lawful alien, or entity that is 
not subject to this part who is in lawful possession, through a lease or 
otherwise, of a farm owned by an individual or entity who is subject to 
this part may receive a payment, loan, and benefit without regard to 
this part.

[[Page 320]]


<R05>
Sec. 1400.502  Notification.

    (a) Any entity, whether foreign or domestic, that executes a program 
contract or agreement under which a payment, loan, or benefit may be 
available must provide written notification to the county committee in 
the county where the entity conducts its farming operation if:
    (1) Any individual, group of individuals, entity, or group of 
entities holds more than a 10 percent beneficial interest in such 
entity; and
    (2) Such individual, group of individuals, entity, or group of 
entities, in accordance with Sec. 1400.501, are ineligible to receive a 
payment, loan and benefit.
    (b) Such written notification must, if known, include the name and 
social security number or taxpayer identification number of such 
individual or entity and of all individuals and entities that hold a 
beneficial interest.
    (c) The failure of the entity to provide this information will 
result in the ineligibility of the entity to receive any payment, loan, 
or benefit.

<R05>
Sec. 1401.1  Applicability.

    This part shall be applicable to payments and loans made in 
accordance with the programs administered by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) or the Farm Service Agency (FSA) as determined and 
announced by the Secretary of Agriculture or a designee of the 
Secretary. The definitions of the terms applicable to 7 CFR part 713 set 
forth at Sec. 713.3 also shall be applicable to this part, except that 
the term ``commodity'' shall mean any agricultural commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.2  Payments in lieu of cash payments.

    (a) CCC will, in accordance with applicable program provisions, make 
payments in a form other than in cash to persons who otherwise are 
eligible to receive a cash payment from CCC. Further, subject only to 
statutory prohibition and notwithstanding any provisions of the contract 
to participate in a program administered by CCC or FSA, CCC may: at its 
option, make payments in a form other than in cash.
    (b) As determined by CCC, payments in a form other than in cash may 
be made in the following manner:
    (1) By delivery of a commodity to a person at a warehouse or other 
similar facility;
    (2) By transfer of negotiable warehouse receipts;
    (3) By the issuance of certificates which CCC shall redeem in 
accordance with this part;
    (4) By the acquisition and use of commodities pledged as collateral 
for CCC price support loans;
    (5) By the use of commodities owned by CCC; and
    (6) By such other methods as CCC determines appropriate, including 
methods to enable the producer to receive payments in order to assure 
that the producer receives the same total return as if the payments had 
been made in cash.
    (c) The value of the payments made in any manner set forth in 
paragraph (b) shall be determined by CCC.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, CCC may, with 
respect to producers who are members of a cooperative marketing 
association which has been determined in accordance with part 1425 of 
this title to be eligible to receive price support on behalf of its 
producer-members, enter into agreements with such producers and such 
cooperatives to facilitate the making of payments to such producers. 
Such agreements may include a provision which allows a producer to make 
available for the use of the cooperative the value of the non-cash 
payment

[[Page 321]]

which would otherwise be made to the producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.3  Payments to persons with outstanding CCC loans.

    (a) Persons with outstanding CCC loans who are eligible to receive 
payments from CCC, including a person authorized to receive a payment on 
behalf of another person, may be required to liquidate such loans in 
accordance with this section in order to be eligible to receive a 
payment authorized by Sec. 1470.2.
    (b) A person with an outstanding CCC loan must, unless otherwise 
agreed upon by the person and CCC, redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of 
the commodity pledged as collateral for a CCC loan, as determined by 
CCC, in an amount equal in value to the value of the payment which would 
otherwise be made to such person. If the person has more than one 
outstanding CCC loan, CCC may, by contract or otherwise, prescribe which 
loan collateral the person shall be required to redeem in order to 
receive payment. The purchase price shall be equal to the cost of 
liquidating the loan or the portion of the loan for which the quantity 
of the commodity sold to CCC is pledged as collateral, except that, in 
the case of a special producer storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve 
loan, the purchase price will not include the amount of any unearned 
advance storage payments received with respect to the redeemed 
collateral. After redemption and the subsequent sale to CCC of the 
commodity pledged as collateral for such CCC loan, CCC shall make 
available to the person a like quantity of the commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.4  Commodity certificates.

    (a) General. CCC may issue commodity certificates as a form of 
payment. Commodity certificates will bear a dollar denomination. Such 
certificate may be transferred, exchanged for the inventory of CCC 
(including the receipt in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section 
of loan collateral by a person to whom a loan secured by such collateral 
is made): or exchanged for cash, as provided for in this section. 
Commodity certificates shall be subject to the provisions of this part, 
and to any terms, conditions and restrictions provided on the 
certificate, which are incorporated by reference herein.
    (b) Liens, encumbrances, and State law. (1) The provisions of this 
section or the commodity certificates shall take precedence over any 
state statutory or regulatory provisions which are inconsistent with the 
provisions of this section or with the provisions of the commodity 
certificates.
    (2) Commodity certificates shall not be subject to any lien, 
encumbrance, or other claim or security interest, except that of an 
agency of the United States Government arising specifically under 
Federal statute.
    (3) The provisions of this paragraph (b) shall apply without regard 
to the identity of the holder of the certificate.
    (c) Transferability. Any person may transfer a commodity certificate 
to any other person. However, any such transfer must be in the full 
amount of the certificate, and can be effected only by restrictive 
endorsement on the back of the certificate, showing the name of the 
transferee and the date of the transfer, and signed by the transferor. 
CCC will not honor any certificate bearing any endorsement to ``bearer'' 
or any other nonrestrictive endorsement, or otherwise transferred in a 
manner contrary to the regulations contained in this section. The person 
who submits a commodity certificate to CCC shall endorse the certificate 
to CCC.
    (d) Exchange of commodity certificate for CCC-owned commodities--(1) 
General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity 
certificate may exchange such certificate, by itself or together with 
other commodity certificates, for such commodities as are made available 
by CCC by endorsing and submitting the certificate to CCC. If a person 
submits commodity certificates for exchange in order that the person 
would be eligible to receive a quantity of a commodity which includes 
less than an entire unit in which the commodity is stored (e.g., less 
than an entire bale of cotton or an entire barrel of honey): (i) Such 
person may forfeit the partial unit of the commodity to CCC, or (ii) CCC 
may issue a

[[Page 322]]

check to such person for the partial unit of the commodity or permit 
such person to purchase the remainder of such unit at a price determined 
by CCC. A person may obtain information regarding commodities available 
for exchange and the procedure for exchange from Kansas City Commodity 
Office, FSA-USDA, Kansas City, MO 64141-0205.
    (2) Minimum quantities. A holder of an amount of commodity 
certificates sufficient to acquire a carload lot, or other quantity as 
may be determined by CCC, may present such amount for exchange at any 
time on or before the expiration date of such certificates. A holder who 
is permitted to exchange the certificate for CCC-owned commodities but 
who does not possess commodity certificates in the amount specified in 
the preceding sentence may, not to exceed once during a calendar month, 
submit such certificates to CCC. CCC will, at CCC's option, pay such 
holder by check in the amount of the certificate or transfer to such 
holder title to commodities owned by CCC.
    (3) CCC-owned commodities stored by a person who submits commodity 
certificates to CCC. CCC may require or permit holders of commodity 
certificates to exchange such certificates for commodities owned by CCC 
which are stored by such holder, without making such commodities or 
kinds of commodities available to other holders of commodity 
certificates.
    (4) Valuation. Except as otherwise may be announced by CCC, CCC will 
determine the value of CCC-owned commodities made available to holders 
of commodity certificates.
    (5) Transfer of title. Title to commodities owned by CCC which are 
transferred to a person who submits commodity certificates to CCC shall 
be transferred in store, except as may be determined and announced by 
CCC. The person who submits certificates to CCC shall be responsible for 
all costs incurred in transferring title to the commodity, except as 
specifically provided by CCC. The transfer of title to such commodities 
shall occur without regard to any State law or any claim of lien against 
the commodity or proceeds thereof which may be asserted by any creditor 
except agencies of the U.S. Government whose lien arises specifically 
under Federal statute.
    (6) Expiration date. CCC may, at its option, discount or refuse to 
accept any commodity certificate presented for exchange after the 
expiration date stated on the certificate.
    (e) Use of commodity certificates to receive loan collateral--(1) 
General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity 
certificate may use such certificate to receive commodities pledged as 
collateral for CCC loans made to such person, at any time on or before 
the expiration date stated on the certificate. A holder of a commodity 
certificate who wishes to receive a quantity of a commodity pledged by 
such person as collateral for a CCC loan in exchange for a certificate 
shall redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of the commodity equal in value 
to the dollar denomination of the certificate, as determined by CCC. The 
purchase price shall be equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the 
portion of the loan for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC 
is pledged as collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer 
storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not 
include the amount of any unearned advanced storage payments received 
with respect to the redeemed loan collateral. Upon submission of the 
certificate, which is endorsed to CCC, to the county FSA office which 
issued the loan, the holder of a commodity certificate will receive the 
quantity of the commodity which has been sold to CCC. Except as 
otherwise determined by CCC, if the holder of such certificate does not 
have commodities pledged as collateral for CCC loans equal in value to 
the dollar denomination of the certificate, as determined by CCC, CCC 
will, at CCC's option and after the producer has submitted the 
certificate, pay the difference to the person by check or in the form of 
a new commodity certificate.
    (2) Ineligible commodities. No person may use a commodity 
certificate to receive a quantity of tobacco, peanuts, or extra long 
staple cotton pledged as collateral for a CCC loan. No person may, 
before August 1, 1986, use a commodity

[[Page 323]]

certificate to receive a quantity of upland cotton pledged as collateral 
for a CCC loan.
    (f) Cash redemption start date. (1) The person to whom a generic 
certificate is issued which has a date entered in block D may submit 
such certificate, endorsed to CCC, at the issuing county FSA office for 
payment by check in the amount of the certificate on or after the date 
entered in block D through the expiration date of the certificate. Such 
person may not exchange the certificate for commodities owned by CCC, 
except as otherwise agreed upon between such person and CCC.
    (2) The person to whom a generic certificate is issued which has an 
entry of ``S/H'' in block D may exchange such certificate for 
commodities owned by CCC.
    (3) The person to whom a commodity specific certificate is issued 
which has a date entered in block D may submit such certificate, 
endorsed to CCC, to the Kansas City Commodity Office for the specific 
commodity entered in block C beginning on the date entered in block D 
through the expiration date of the certificate. Such certificate may not 
be exchanged for cash, except as otherwise agreed on by CCC.
    (4) All other certificates may be transferred and exchanged as 
determined and announced by CCC.
    (g) ``Generic'' and commodity-specific commodity certificates--(1) 
General. If a commodity certificate indicates that it is a ``generic'' 
certificate, such certificate may, subject to the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, be exchanged for any 
commodity made available by CCC or, as appropriate, used to receive a 
quantity of any commodity which serves as collateral for a CCC loan. If 
a certificate is not a ``generic certificate'', such certificate may be 
exchanged for the commodity specified on the certificate, except as may 
be determined and announced by CCC.
    (2) Cotton program payments. Certificates issued as payments under 
the 1991 through 1995 upland cotton program, including payments issued 
in accordance with section 103B(a)(5)(B) of the Agricultural Act of 
1949, may be exchanged for CCC-owned upland cotton only during such 
times as determined and announced by CCC.
    (3) Commodities not available in CCC inventory. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this section, if a person submits a commodity 
specific certificate to CCC in exchange for a quantity of such commodity 
and CCC determines it is not possible to make such commodity available, 
CCC may: (i) Require such person to exchange the commodity specific 
certificate for a generic certificate; or (ii) refuse to accept 
submission of such certificate until CCC is able to make available a 
quantity of the commodity specified on such certificate.
    (h) CCC, at its option, may discount or refuse to accept any 
certificate made, transferred, or submitted in violation of this 
section.
    (i) Interest. With respect to producers who receive commodity 
certificates in accordance with the wheat, feed grains, upland cotton 
and rice price support and production adjustment programs authorized by 
parts 1413 and 1421 of this title, a producer to whom the certificate is 
issued who exchanges such a certificate with CCC for cash in accordance 
with subsection (f) of this section shall receive interest with respect 
to such certificate for a 150 day period. Such interest shall be the 
rate of interest determined in accordance with part 1405 of this Title 
which is in effect on the date the certificate is issued.

Sec. 1401.5  In kind payments.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of Secs. 1470.2 and 1470.3, CCC may 
make payments in the form of commodities. Quantities of commodities made 
available as payment shall be based upon the value of the commodity, as 
determined by CCC. Such quantity may be adjusted by CCC to reflect the 
location, quality, and other similar factors which CCC determines to 
affect the value of the commodity.
    (b) The transfer of title to commodities made available in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be in store, except 
as determined by CCC, and shall be made without regard to any State law 
or any claim of lien

[[Page 324]]

against the commodity, or proceeds thereof, which may be asserted by any 
creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government whose lien arises 
specifically under Federal statute. The recipient of such commodities 
shall be responsible for all costs incurred in transferring title to the 
commodity, except as specifically provided by CCC.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 1401.8  Subsequent holders.

    (a) General. A person who acquires a commodity certificate from 
another person shall be considered to be a ``subsequent holder'' of the 
certificate. Subsequent holders of certificates who purchased a

expiration date specified on the certificate, submit the certificate to 
CCC for a payment from CCC determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. All certificates must be submitted after January 2,

Sec. 1403.5  Collection by payment in full.

    Except as CCC may provide in accordance with Sec. 1403.6, CCC shall 
collect debts owed to the Government, including applicable interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, in full, whenever feasible whether 
the debt is being collected by administrative offset or by another

in full by the specified date. The size and frequency of installment 
payments shall:
    (1) Bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the 
debtor's ability to pay; and
    (2) Normally be of sufficient size and frequency to liquidate the 
debt in not more than three years.
    (b) Except as otherwise determined by CCC, no installment 
arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a certified 
financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, 
income, and expenses. The financial statement shall not be required to 
be submitted sooner than 15 business days following its request by CCC.
    (c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and may 
require the payment of interest at the late payment interest rate in 
effect on the date such agreement is executed. The installment agreement 
shall specify all the terms of the arrangement and include provision for 
accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. A confession of 
judgment provision may be included in the agreement.
    (d) CCC may deem a repayment plan to be abrogated if the debtor 
fails to comply with its terms.

[[Page 329]]

    (e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information 
discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered, the debtor 
may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by 
executing a security agreement and financing agreement which provides 
CCC a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full.
    (f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to CCC, CCC may allow the 
debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary installment payment 
is to be applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a 
voluntary installment or partial payment, the payment will be applied to 
such debts as determined by CCC.

administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by 
statute; and
    (5) IRS Notices of Levy which shall be honored in accordance with 
IRS statutes and regulations.
    (b) Debts due CCC may be collected by administrative offset from 
amounts payable by CCC when:
    (1) The debtor has been provided written notification of the basis 
and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make 
payment. Such written notification and opportunity includes notice of 
the right to pursue an administrative appeal in accordance with part 780 
of this Title or any other applicable appeal procedures, if not 
previously provided;
    (2) The debtor has been provided an opportunity to request to

    (3) The debtor has been notified in writing that the debt may be 
collected by administrative offset if not paid; and
    (4) The debt has not been delinquent for more than ten years or 
legal action to enforce the debt has not been barred by an applicable 
period of limitation, whichever is later.
    (c) Administrative offset shall also be effected against amounts 
payable by CCC:
    (1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or
    (2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of CCC.
    (d) Debts due CCC from carriers for overcharges shall be offset 
against amounts due such carriers under freight bills involving

    (1) The carrier, without reasonable justification, has declined 
payment of the debt or has failed to pay the debt after being given a 
reasonable opportunity to make payment; and
    (2) The period of limitation prescribed at 49 U.S.C. 11706(f) has 
not expired.

necessary by CCC to protect the financial interests of the Government.
    (h) In the case of any procurement contract with CCC which provides 
for invoicing at the time of shipment with delivery to be made at 
designated destination points when:
    (1) Payment is made to the contractor prior to receipt of evidence 
of delivery, and
    (2) CCC thereafter determines that the Contractor is indebted to CCC 
because of losses sustained from shortage, damage to or deterioration of 
the commodity while in transit and prior to delivery, CCC may offset 
such indebtedness against amounts due and payable to the Contractor 
under any other contract with CCC providing the Contractor has not 
assigned the proceeds of such contract in accordance with part 1404 of 
this chapter.
    (i) CCC may effect administrative offset against a payment to be 
made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by 
(b)(1-3) of this section if:
    (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice CCC's 
ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of those procedures.
    (j)(1) Debts due any agency other than CCC shall be offset against 
amounts payable by CCC to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government 
has submitted a written request for offset which is mailed or hand-
delivered to the appropriate FSA State office, Kansas City Management 
Office or Kansas City Commodity Office. Such written request must:
    (i) Bear the signature of an authorized representative of the

the regulations for collection of the debt and for requesting offset 
have been complied with;

debtor and a brief description of the basis of the debt, including 
identification of the judgment, if any.
    (iv) State the amount of the debt separately as to principal, 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest, if any, shall 
be computed on a daily basis to a date shown in the request. The amount 
to be offset shall not exceed the principal sum owed by the debtor, plus 
interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment 
interest, penalties and administrative costs that have been assessed;
    (v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the 
debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order of the bankruptcy 
court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and
    (vi) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact 
person within the agency and the address to which payment should be 
sent.
    (2) Unless prohibited by law, the head of an agency, or a designee, 
may defer or subordinate in whole or in part the right of the agency to 
recover through offset all or part of any indebtedness to such agency, 
or may withdraw a request for offset. Notice of such action must be sent 
to the appropriate FSA office.
    (k)(1) After CCC has complied with the provisions of this part, CCC 
may request other agencies of the Government to offset amounts payable 
by them to persons indebted to CCC.
    (2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the 
provisions at Sec. 1403.18 shall apply.
    (l)(1) Debts shall be collected by offset in the following order of 
priority without regard to the date of the request for such collection:
    (i) Debts to CCC.
    (ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by CCC.
    (iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by CCC.
    (2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, CCC

applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered 
to be in the Government's best interest. Such decision shall be made by 
CCC based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

[[Page 331]]

    (m)(1) No amounts payable to a debtor by CCC shall be paid to an 
assignee until there have been collected any amounts owed by the debtor 
except as provided in this subsection.
    (2) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
Chapter by execution of Form CCC-36 shall be subject to offset for any 
debt owed to CCC or FSA without regard to the date notice of assignment 
was accepted by CCC or FSA.
    (3) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
Chapter by execution of Form CCC-252 shall be offset:
    (i) Against any debt of the assignor entered on the debt record of 
the applicable FSA office prior to the filing of such form with CCC or 
FSA, or
    (ii) At anytime, regardless of the date of filing of such form with 
CCC or FSA, if the debt which is the basis for the offset arises under 
the same contract under which the payment is earned by the assignor.
    (4) With respect to all other Federal agencies, offset shall be made 
of any amounts due any other Federal agency which are entered on the 
debt record of the appropriate FSA office prior to the date the notice 
of assignment was accepted by CCC or FSA.
    (5) Any amount due and payable to the assignor which remains after 
deduction of amounts paid to the assignee shall be available for offset.
    (n) Amounts recovered by offset for CCC and FSA debts but later 
found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.
    (o) The debtor shall be notified whenever any offset action has been 
taken.
    (p) Offsets made pursuant to this section shall not deprive a debtor 
of any right he might otherwise have to contest the debt involved in the 
offset action either by administrative appeal or by legal action.
    (q) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be 
taken:
    (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity 
which the debtor participates in, either directly or indirectly, as 
determined by CCC.
    (2) When CCC determines that the debtor has established an entity, 
or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other 
manner, their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the 
claim or debt.
    (r) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated 
amount of the debt, including interest, administrative charges, and 
penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger 
specified amount be offset.
    (s) Offset action will not be taken against payments when:
    (1) The payment represents loan or purchase proceeds for a commodity 
which is subject to the rights of the holder of a prior valid 
enforceable lien. However, any amount that exceeds the amount of the 
prior lien shall be available for offset.
    (2) A debt has been discharged as provided in Sec. 1403.15.
    (3) The amount payable to the debtor is used to satisfy a prior lien 
on property pledged as collateral for a CCC loan or sold to CCC. 
However, any amount exceeding the amount of the prior lien shall be 
available for offset.
    (4) CCC determines such action will unduly interfere with the 
administration of a CCC or FSA program.
    (5) The debt has been delinquent for more than ten years or legal 
action to enforce the debt due CCC is barred by an applicable period of 
limitation, whichever is later.
    (t)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 1403.4, with respect to debts which are based upon an 
unsettled CCC loan, offset action may be taken when the debtor has been:
    (i) Provided written notification of the maturity date of the loan 
and the debtor has not repaid the loan by the maturity date or, in the 
case of a nonrecourse price support loan, has not repaid the loan or 
forfeited the loan collateral to CCC by the date specified by CCC;
    (ii) Notified of CCC's intent to establish an account on a debt 
record 30 days after the maturity date, or other applicable period of 
time, if the loan is not settled in accordance with the loan agreement;
    (iii) Notified of the right to pursue an administrative appeal in 
accordance with part 780 of this title if such an opportunity has not 
been previously provided;

[[Page 332]]

    (iv) Provided an opportunity to inspect and copy CCC records related 
to the debt; and
    (v) Notified in writing that the debt may be collected by 
administrative offset if the loan is not repaid or, with respect to 
nonrecourse loans only, settled through forfeiture of the loan 
collateral.
    (2) After a claim has been established by CCC with respect to a loan 
which has not been settled by the date specified in the loan agreement:
    (i) In the event CCC takes possession of the collateral which is 
security for a nonrecourse of recourse loan made in accordance with 
parts 1421, 1427, 1434, or 1435 of this chapter, the value of such loan 
collateral shall be determined by CCC in accordance with the provisions 
of such parts which are used to determine the settlement value of the 
collateral. The value of such collateral shall be applied to the claim. 
Any amount remaining due on the claim must be paid by the debtor.
    (ii) In the event CCC takes possession of the collateral which is 
the security for any other loan, the value of such collateral, as 
determined by CCC, less any costs incurred by CCC in taking possession 
and disposing of the collateral, shall be applied to the claim. Any 
amount remaining due on the claim must be paid by the debtor.

<R05>
Sec. 1403.8  Withholding.

    (a) Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an 
applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable to a debtor 
by CCC to ensure that the interests of CCC and the United States will be 
protected as provided in this section.
    (b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of CCC or the 
United States only if CCC determines that:
    (1) There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of 
program requirements and the withholding action is considered necessary 
to protect the financial interests of CCC;
    (2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil 
frauds statutes and criminal prosecution or civil frauds action is of 
primary importance to program operations of CCC;
    (3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will 
be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor are not withheld;
    (4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a 
judgment on the claim of CCC;
    (5) The facts available to CCC are insufficient to determine the 
amount to be offset or the proper payee;
    (6) A judgment on a claim of CCC has been obtained; or
    (7) Such action has been requested by the Department of Justice.
    (c) Except for debts due CCC or FSA, withholding action by CCC on 
amounts payable to debtors of other Government agencies may not be made 
unless requested by the Department of Justice.

<R05>
Sec. 1403.9  Late payment interest and administrative charges.

    (a)(1) The provisions of this section are applicable to all persons 
whose debt to CCC becomes delinquent after January 1, 1990, unless the 
debtor and CCC agree otherwise.
    (2) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not 
apply:
    (i) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local 
governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall be charged in 
accordance with applicable statutes or, if none are applicable, at the 
rate of interest charged by the U.S. Treasury for funds borrowed by CCC 
on the day the debt became delinquent;
    (ii) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement or contract 
either prohibits the charging of such interest or specifies the interest 
or charges applicable to the debt involved;
    (iii) If the late payment interest is waived by CCC.
    (b) CCC will assess late payment interest on the full amount of 
delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term ``full amount 
of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued regular 
loan interest or accrued program interest, and any other charges which 
are otherwise due and owing to CCC on the delinquent debt at the time 
the late payment interest is

[[Page 333]]

assessed, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate 
of interest which CCC charges on delinquent debts. The late payment 
interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's 
current value of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the 
Prompt Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
    (d)(1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract or 
other agreement with specific provisions for late payment interest and 
payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of 
the debt from the first day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise 
provided by statute.
    (2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, 
contract or agreement containing specific provisions for late payment 
interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which notice of the debt is first mailed or 
hand-delivered to the debtor, except that, with respect to debts 
resulting from price support loans, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which a claim is established.
    (3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be 
fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except when a debtor has 
defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new 
agreement. CCC may then set a new rate of interest which reflects the 
late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is 
executed. All charges which accrued, but which were not collected under 
the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid 
under a new repayment agreement.
    (4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a 
daily basis.
    (e)(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (e)(2) of this 
section, an additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will 
be assessed on any portion of a debt which remains unpaid 90 days after 
the date described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, if no 
repayment schedule satisfactory to CCC has been agreed upon. Such rate 
will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began 
to accrue and apply on a daily basis. Such rate shall continue to accrue 
until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (2) With respect to debts resulting from price support loans, an 
additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will be assessed 
on a portion of a debt which remains unpaid 60 days after the date on 
which a claim was established. Such rate will be assessed retroactively 
from the date of claim establishment and apply on a daily basis. Such 
rate shall continue to accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (f) CCC shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs 
of processing delinquent debts against the debtor, to the extent such 
costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are 
not limited to, costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of 
employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing 
contractors for collection services, costs of selling collateral or 
property to satisfy the debt.
    (g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments 
will be applied first to administrative charges, second to additional 
interest assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and 
late payment interest, and third to outstanding principal.

<R05>
Sec. 1403.10  Waiver of late payment interest, additional interest and administrative charges.

    (a) Except for debts resulting from price support loans, CCC shall 
waive the collection of late payment interest and administrative charges 
on a debt or any portion of a debt which is paid within 30 days after 
the date on which late payment interest began to accrue.
    (b) CCC may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion 
of the additional interest on debts which are appealed in accordance 
with 7 CFR part

[[Page 334]]

780, or other applicable appeal procedures, from either the date of the 
appeal or the date of delinquency, as determined by CCC, until the date 
a final administrative determination is issued. However, with respect to 
CCC programs administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service, CCC shall 
waive the assessment and collection of additional interest on debts 
which are appealed in accordance with 7 CFR part 780, or other 
applicable appeal procedures, from the date of delinquency until 30 days 
after the date of the letter informing the appellant of the final 
administrative determination. The waiver provisions of the paragraph 
shall not apply during any period of delay due to:
    (1) The appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled 
hearing;
    (2) The appellant's request for an additional time following the 
hearing to present additional information or a written closing 
statement; or
    (3) The appellant's failure to timely present information to the 
reviewing authority.
    (c) Assessment and collection of late payment interest, additional 
interest and administrative charges under this part may be waived by CCC 
in full, or in part, if it is determined that such action is in the best 
interest of CCC.

procedure, a debtor may obtain an administrative review under part 780 
of this title, or other applicable appeal procedures, of CCC's

is filed with the authority who made the determination within 15 days of

    When a debtor is employed by the Federal Government or is a member 
of the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by 
offset cannot be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, CCC may 
contact the employing agency to arrange for payment of the debt by 
allotment or otherwise, in accordance with section 206 of Executive 
Order No. 11222, May 8, 1965, 30 FR 6469.

Sec. 1403.14  Prior provision of rights with respect to debt.

    CCC will not provide an administrative appeal with respect to issues 
which were subject to administrative review at the debtor's request as 
provided under another statute or regulation before:
    (a) Effecting administrative offset;
    (b) Referring the debt to private collection or credit reporting 
agencies;
    (c) Referring the debt to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
for salary offset against the current pay of a present or former

it is valid and delinquent.
    (c) Before a debt may be referred to a credit reporting agency, the

overpayments (``overpayments'').
    (b) The following definition shall be applicable to this section:
    Financial hardship means that condition of a producer in which 
payment of the debt by lump sum would jeopardize the producer's ability 
to provide food,

[[Page 337]]

shelter, and medical care to his immediate family, or to continue the 
producer's farming operation, as determined by CCC.
    (c) This section applies to collection of overpayments from those 
producers who are suffering financial hardship, as determined by CCC, 
and who also meet the following conditions, as determined by CCC:
    (1) Who received an advance deficiency payment for the 1988 or 1989 
crop of a commodity under part 1413 of this chapter;
    (2) Who are required to provide a refund of at least $1,500 of such 
payment, as a result of the increase in market prices of the commodity;
    (3) Who reside in a county, or in a county that is contiguous to a 
county where CCC has determined that farming, ranching, or aquaculture 
operations have been substantially affected as evidenced by a reduction 
in normal production for the county of at least 30 percent during two of 
the three crop years 1988, 1989, and 1990 by:
    (i) A natural disaster designated by the Secretary of Agriculture;
    (ii) A major disaster or emergency designated by the President under 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
5121 et seq.);
    (4) Where the total quantity of the 1988 or 1989 crop of the 
commodity that the producers were able to harvest is less than the 
result of multiplying 65 percent of the farm payment yield established 
CCC for the crop by the sum of the acreage planted for the harvest and 
the acreage prevented from being planted (because of the disaster or 
emergency referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) for the crop; 
and
    (5) Who have applied to the County Farm Service Agency Office which 
issued the advance deficiency payment, no later than May 31, 1991, for a 
determination of eligibility for the repayment provisions of this 
section.
    (d) CCC shall assess interest on delinquent debts for 1988 or 1989 
overpayments as follows:
    (1) CCC shall establish a regional annual interest rate for each of 
12 geographic regions, corresponding to the extent practicable, as 
determined by CCC, with the 12 geographic districts of the Farm Credit 
System.
    (2) Each regional annual interest rate shall not exceed the average 
of the interest rates charged by Farm Credit System institutions within 
the region to high-risk borrowers on 1-year operating loans, as 
determined by CCC based upon information provided to CCC by the Farm 
Credit System.
    (3) Interest shall accrue at the established regional annual 
interest rate for the region in which the debt arose, beginning November 
28, 1990.
    (e) CCC shall not offset, in each of the crop years 1990, 1991, and 
1992, more than \1/3\ of the farm program payments otherwise due a 
producer, as a result of the producer's delinquency in repaying the 
overpayment.
    (f) CCC shall permit producers to repay the overpayment in three 
equal installments during each of the crop years 1990, 1991, and 1992, 
if the producers document to CCC that they have entered into agreements 
to obtain multiperil crop insurance policies for the 1991 and 1992 crop 
years.

1410, 1412, 1421, 1427, 1435, 1443, 1446, or 1464, the producer must 
obtain at least the catastrophic level of insurance for each crop of 
economic significance in which the producer has an interest or provide a 
written waiver to the Secretary that waives any eligibility for 
emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop, if insurance 
is available in the county for the crop. In meeting this requirement, 
the producer may:
    (1) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance in all 
counties for each crop of economic significance in which the producer 
has an interest;
    (2) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance for 
some, but not all, crops of economic significance for which the producer 
has an interest, and sign a waiver; or
    (3) Sign a waiver that waives any eligibility for crop loss 
assistance in connection with the producer's crop.
    (b) Crop of economic significance. The term ``crop of economic 
significance'' means a crop that has contributed in the previous year, 
or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, 10 percent or 
more of the total expected value of all crops grown by the producer. 
However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the total expected 
liability under the catastrophic risk protection endorsement is equal to 
or less than the administrative fee required for the crop, such crop 
will not be considered a crop of economic significance.


<R05>
Sec. 1405.7  Uruguay Round Agreements Act.

    In the event the outlays by the United States for domestic support 
measures will exceed, in any required reporting period, the allowable 
levels under the Uruguay Round Agreements (as defined in section 2 of

Secretary of Agriculture, reduce the amount of payments and benefits to 
be made in any such reporting period, and/or collect a refund of 
payments or benefits previously made with respect to such reporting 
period, under parts 1412, 1413, 1421, 1427, 1430, 1434 and 1435 of this 
chapter in order to ensure that the level of domestic support provided 
by the United States complies with the commitments of the United States

and county committees do not have the authority to modify or waive any 
of the provisions in this part unless specifically authorized by the 
Deputy Administrator.
    (c) The State committee may take any action authorized or required 
by this part to be taken by the county committee which has not been 
taken by such committee, such as:
    (1) Correct or require a county committee to correct any action 
taken by such county committee which is not in accordance with this 
part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action which 
is not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No delegation herein to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, the Administrator, FSA, or a 
designee, or the Deputy Administrator from determining any question 
arising under this part or from reversing or modifying any determination 
made by a State or county committee.
    (e) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine 
eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; 
however, the failure to

[[Page 347]]

provide data could result in program benefits being withheld or denied.
    (f) Notwithstanding other provisions of the preceding paragraphs of 
this section, the EI, suitability of land for permanent vegetative or 
water cover, factors for determining the likelihood of improved water 
quality and adequacy of the planned practice to achieve desired

<R05>
Sec. 1410.3  General description.

    (a) Under the CRP, CCC will enter into contracts with eligible 
participants to convert eligible land to a conserving use for a period 
of time of not less than 10 nor more than 15 years in return for 
financial and technical assistance.
    (b) A conservation plan for eligible acreage must be obtained by a 
participant which must be approved by the conservation district in which 
the lands are located unless the conservation district declines to 
review the plan in which case NRCS may take such further action as is 
needed to account for lack of such review.
    (c) The objectives of the CRP are to cost-effectively reduce water 
and wind erosion, protect the Nation's long-term capability to produce 
food and fiber, reduce sedimentation, improve water quality, create and 
enhance wildlife habitat, and other objectives including encouraging 
more permanent conservation practices and tree planting.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided, a participant may, in addition to 
any payment under this part, receive cost-share assistance, rental or 
easement payments, or tax benefits from a State, subdivision of such 
State, or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in CRP. 
However, a participant may not receive or retain CRP cost-share 
assistance if other Federal cost-share assistance is provided for such 
acreage under any other provision of law, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator. Further, under no circumstances may the cost-share 
payments received under this part, or otherwise, exceed the cost of the 
practice, as determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.4  Maximum county acreage.

    The maximum acreage which may be placed in the CRP and the WRP may 
not exceed 25 percent of the total cropland in the county of which no 
more than 10 percent of the cropland in the county may be subject, in 
the aggregate, to a CRP or WRP easement, unless CCC determines that such 
action would not adversely affect the local economy of the county. This 
restriction on participation shall be in addition to any other 
restriction imposed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.5  Eligible persons.

    (a) In order to be eligible to enter into a CRP contract in 
accordance with this part, a person must be an owner, operator, or 
tenant of eligible land and:
    (1) If an operator of eligible land, seeking to participate without 
the owner, must have operated such land for at least 12 months prior to 
the close of the applicable signup period and must provide satisfactory 
evidence that such operator will be in control of such eligible land for 
the full term of the CRP contract period;
    (2) If an owner of eligible land, must have owned such land for at 
least 12

[[Page 351]]

months prior to the close of the applicable signup period, unless:
    (i) The new owner acquired such land by will or succession as a 
result of the death of the previous owner;
    (ii) The only ownership change in the 12 month period occurred due 
to foreclosure on the land and the owner of the land, immediately before 
the foreclosure, exercises a timely right of redemption from the 
mortgage holder in accordance with State law;
    (iii) As determined by the Deputy Administrator, the circumstances 
of the acquisition are such that present adequate assurance that the new 
owner of such eligible land did not acquire such land for the purpose of 
placing it in the CRP; or
    (3) If a tenant, the tenant is a participant with an eligible owner 
or operator.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, under continuous 
signup provisions authorized by Sec. 1410.30, an otherwise eligible 
person must have owned or operated, as appropriate, the eligible land 
for at least 12 months prior to submission of an offer.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.6  Eligible land.

    (a) In order to be eligible to be placed in the CRP, land:
    (1) Must be cropland that:
    (i) Has been annually planted or considered planted to an 
agricultural commodity in 2 of the 5 most recent crop years, as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, provided further that field 
margins which are incidental to the planting of crops may also be 
considered qualifying cropland to the extent determined appropriate by 
the Deputy Administrator; and
    (ii) Is physically and legally capable of being planted in a normal 
manner to an agricultural commodity, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (2) Must be marginal pasture land, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, that:
    (i) Is enrolled or has recently been enrolled in the WBP provided:
    (A) The acreage is in the final year of the WBP agreement or, if not 
in the final year of the WBP agreement and only for enrollments in the 
CRP for FY 1997, is acreage for which the WBP agreement expired on 
December 31, 1996, where the land would be considered in compliance if 
such agreement was still in effect, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator;
    (B) The acreage is not classified as naturally occurring type 3 
through 7 wetlands, as determined by the Deputy Administrator regardless 
of whether the acreage is or is not protected by a Federal agency 
easement or mortgage restriction (types 3 through 7 wetlands that are 
normally artificially flooded shall not be precluded from eligibility), 
and;
    (C) Enrollment in CRP would enhance the environmental benefits of 
the site, as determined by Deputy Administrator; or
    (ii) Is determined to be suitable for use as a riparian buffer. A 
field or portion of a field of marginal pasture land may be considered 
to be suitable for use as a riparian buffer only if, as determined by 
NRCS, it:
    (A) Is located adjacent to permanent stream corridors excluding 
corridors that are considered gullies or sod waterways; and
    (B) Is capable, when permanent grass, forbs, shrubs or trees are 
grown, of substantially reducing sediment that otherwise would be 
delivered to the adjacent stream or waterbody; or
    (3) Must be acreage currently enrolled in the CRP provided the 
scheduled expiration date of the current CRP contract is to occur before 
the available effective date of a new CRP contract, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator, provided the acreage is otherwise eligible 
according to this part, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) Any land qualifying under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) 
must also, to be eligible for a contract:
    (1) Be a field or portion of a field determined to be suitable for

[[Page 352]]

the CRP. A field or portion of a field may be considered to be suitable 
for use as a filter strip or riparian buffer only if it, as determined 
by NRCS:
    (i) Is located adjacent to a stream, other waterbody of a permanent 
nature (such as a lake, pond, or sinkhole), or wetland excluding such 
areas as gullies or sod waterways; and
    (ii) Is capable, when permanent grass, forbs, shrubs or trees are 
grown, of substantially reducing sediment that otherwise would be 
delivered to the adjacent stream or waterbody; or
    (2)(i) Be a field which has evidence of scour erosion caused by out-
of-bank flows of water, as determined by NRCS. In addition such land 
must:
    (A) Be expected to flood a minimum of once every 10 years; and
    (B) Have evidence of scour erosion as a result of such flooding.
    (ii) To the extent practicable, be the actual affected cropland 
areas of a field; however, the entire cropland area of an eligible field 
may be enrolled if:
    (A) The size of the field is 9 acres or less; or
    (B) More than one third of the cropland in the field is land which 
lies between the water source and the inland limit of the scour erosion.
    (iii) If the full field is not eligible for enrollment under this 
paragraph (b)(2), be that portion of the cropland between the waterbody 
and the inland limit of the scour erosion together with, as determined 
by the Deputy Administrator, additional areas which would otherwise be 
unmanageable and would be isolated by the eligible areas.
    (iv) Be planted to an appropriate tree species according to the 
FOTG, unless tree planting is determined to be inappropriate by NRCS, in 
consultation with Forest Service, in which case the eligible cropland 
shall be devoted to another acceptable permanent vegetative cover in 
accordance with the FOTG; or
    (3) Be contributing to the degradation of water quality or posing an 
on-site or off-site environmental threat to water quality if such land 
remains in production so long as water quality objectives, with respect 
to such land, cannot be obtained under other Federal programs, including 
but not limited to EQIP authorized under part 1466 of this chapter; or
    (4) Be devoted to certain covers, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, which are established and maintained according to the 
FOTG provided such acreage is not required to be maintained as such 
under any life-span obligations, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator; or
    (5) Be non-irrigated or irrigated cropland which produces or serves 
as the recharge area, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, for 
saline seeps, or acreage which is functionally related to such saline 
seeps, or where a rising water table contributes to increased levels of 
salinity at or near the ground surface; or
    (6) Be considered HEL according to conservation compliance 
provisions under part 12 of this chapter; or
    (7) For redefined fields, have an EI of greater than or equal to 8, 
calculated by using the weighted average of the EI's of soil map units 
within the field; or
    (8) Be within a public wellhead protection area or in an approved 
Hydrologic Unit Area; or
    (9) Be within a designated conservation priority area; or
    (10) Be designated as a cropped wetland and appropriate associated 
acreage, as determined by the Deputy Administrator; or
    (11) Be cropland which, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, 
is associated with noncropped wetlands and would provide significant 
environmental benefits; or
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, land 
shall be ineligible for enrollment if, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, land is:
    (1) Federally owned land unless the applicant has a lease for the 
contract period;
    (2) Land on which the use of the land is restricted through deed or 
other restriction prior to enrollment in CRP prohibiting the production 
of agricultural commodities except for eligible land under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section; or
    (3) Land already enrolled in the CRP unless the scheduled expiration 
date of the current contract is to occur before

[[Page 353]]

the available effective date of a new CRP contract, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.7  Duration of contracts.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, contracts 
under this part shall be for a term of 10 years.
    (b) In the case of land devoted to riparian buffers, filter strips, 
restoration of wetlands, hardwood trees, shelterbelts, windbreaks, 
wildlife corridors, or other practices deemed appropriate by CCC under 
the original terms of a contract subject to this part or for land 
devoted to eligible practices under a contract modified under 
Sec. 1410.10, the participant may specify the duration of the contract 
provided that such contracts must be at least 10 years and no more than 
a total of 15 years in length.
    (c) All contracts shall expire on September 30 of the appropriate 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.8  Conservation priority areas.

    (a) CCC may designate National conservation priority areas according 
to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) State FSA committees, in consultation with NRCS and State 
Technical Committees, may submit a recommendation to the Deputy 
Administrator within guidelines established by the Deputy Administrator 
for designation of conservation priority areas. Such recommendations 
should contain clearly defined conservation and environmental objectives 
and analysis of how CRP can cost-effectively address such objectives. 
The purpose of the conservation priority area designation is to enhance 
the CRP by better addressing conservation and environmental issues in a 
planned and coordinated manner within a State. Generally, the total 
acreage of conservation priority areas, in aggregate, shall not total 
more than 10 percent of the cropland in a State unless there are 
identified and documented extraordinary environmental needs, as 
determined by Deputy Administrator.
    (c) A region shall be eligible for designation as a priority area 
only if the region has actual significant adverse water quality or 
wildlife habitat impacts related to activities of agricultural 
production or if the designation helps agricultural producers to comply 
with Federal and State environmental laws.
    (d) Conservation priority area designations shall expire after 5 
years unless redesignated, except they may be withdrawn:
    (1) Upon application by the appropriate State water quality agency; 
or
    (2) By the Deputy Administrator.
    (e) In those areas designated as conservation priority areas, under 
this section, special emphasis will be placed on identified 
environmental concerns. These concerns may include water quality, such 
as assisting agricultural producers to comply with nonpoint source 
pollution requirements, air quality, or wildlife habitat (especially for 
currently listed threatened and endangered species or to prevent other 
species from becoming threatened and endangered), as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.9  Alley-cropping.

    (a) Alley-cropping on CRP land may be permitted by CCC if:
    (1) The land is planted to, or converted to, hardwood trees in 
accordance with Sec. 1410.10;
    (2) Agricultural commodities are planted in accordance with a prior, 
site-specific and NRCS approved conservation plan in close proximity to 
such hardwood trees; and
    (3) The owner and operator of such land agree to implement 
appropriate conservation measures on such land.
    (b) CCC may solicit bids for alley-cropping permission for CRP land. 
Annual rental payments for the term of any contract modified under this 
section shall be reduced by at least 50 percent of the original amount 
of the total rental payment in the original contract and, in the case of 
any contract modified to change from another cover crop, the total 
annual rental payments over the term of any such contract may not exceed 
the total annual rental payments specified in the original contract.
    (c) The actual reduction in rental payment will be determined by 
CCC, based upon criteria, such as percentage of the total acreage that 
will be available for cropping and projected returns to the producer 
from such cropping.

[[Page 354]]

    (d) The area available for cropping will be chosen according to the 
FOTG and will be farmed in accordance with an approved conservation plan 
so as to minimize erosion and degradation of water quality during those 
years when the areas are devoted to an agricultural commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.10  Conversion to trees.

    An owner or operator who has entered into a contract prior to 
November 28, 1990, may elect to convert areas of highly erodible 
cropland, subject to such contract, which is devoted to permanent 
vegetative cover, from such cover to hardwood trees (including alley 
cropping and riparian buffers limited to hardwood trees where permitted 
by CCC), windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors.
    (a) With respect to any contract modified under this section, the 
participant may elect to extend such contract in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1410.7(b).
    (b) With respect to any contract modified under this section in 
which such areas are converted to windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife 
corridors, the owner of such land must agree to maintain such plantings 
for a time period established by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) CCC shall, as it determines appropriate, pay up to 50 percent of 
the eligible cost of establishing new conservation measures authorized 
under this section, except that the total cost-share paid with respect 
to such contract, including cost-share assistance paid when the original 
cover was established, may not exceed the amount by which CCC would have 
paid had such land been originally devoted to such new conservation 
measures.
    (d) With respect to any contract modified under this section, the 
participant must participate in the Forest Stewardship Program (16 
U.S.C. 2103a).


<R05>
Sec. 1410.11  Restoration of wetlands.

    (a) An owner or operator who entered into a CRP contract on land 
that is suitable for restoration to wetlands or that was restored to 
wetlands while under such contract, may, if approved by CCC, subject to 
any restrictions as may be imposed by law, apply to transfer such 
eligible acres subject to such contract that are devoted to an approved 
cover from the CRP to the WRP. Transferred acreage shall be terminated 
from the CRP effective the day a WRP easement is filed. Participants 
will receive a prorated CRP annual payment for that part of the year the 
acreage was enrolled in the CRP according to Sec. 1410.42. Refunds of 
cost-share payments or any applicable incentive payments need not be 
required unless specified by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) An owner or operator who has enrolled acreage in the CRP may, as 
determined and approved by CCC, restore suitable acres to wetlands with 
cost-share assistance provided that Federal cost-share assistance has 
not been previously provided specifically for wetland restoration on the 
proposed restoration site. In addition to the cost-share limitation in 
Sec. 1410.41 of this part, an additional one time financial incentive 
may be provided to encourage restoration of the hydrology of the site.


<R05>

the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) CCC may modify CRP contracts to add, delete, or substitute 
practices when:
    (1) The installed practice failed to adequately provide for the 
desired environmental benefit through no fault of the participant; or
    (2) The installed measure deteriorated because of conditions beyond 
the control of the participant; and
    (3) Another practice will achieve at least the same level of 
environmental benefit.
    (c) Offers to extend contracts may be made available to the extent

Sec. 1410.34  Extended program protection.

    (a) In the final year of the contract, participants may, subject to 
the terms and conditions announced by CCC request to extend the 
preservation of quota and acreage allotment history for 5 years (and, if 
announced by CCC, in successive 5-year increments). Such approval may be 
given by CCC only if the participant agrees to continue for that period, 
but without payment, to abide by the terms and conditions which applied 
to the relevant contract relating to the conservation of the property 
for the term in which payments were to be made.
    (b) Where such an extension is approved, no additional cost-share, 
annual rental, or other payment shall be made.
    (c) Haying and grazing of the acreage subject to such an extension 
may be permitted during the extension period, except during any 
consecutive 5-month period between April 1 and October 31 of any year as 
established by the State committee. In the event of a natural disaster, 
CCC may permit unlimited haying and grazing of such acreage.
    (d) In the event of a violation of any CRP contract extended under 
this section, CCC may reduce or terminate, retroactively, prospectively, 
or both, the amount of quota, and acreage allotment history otherwise 
preserved under the extended contract.

Sec. 1410.40  Cost-share payments.

    (a) Cost-share payments shall be made available upon a determination 
by CCC that an eligible practice, or an identifiable unit thereof, has 
been established in compliance with the appropriate standards and 
specifications.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided for in this part, cost-share 
payments may be made under the CRP only for the cost-effective 
establishment or installation of an eligible practice.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, cost-share 
payments shall not be made to the same owner or operator on the same 
acreage for any eligible practices which have been previously

[[Page 360]]

share assistance from any Federal agency.
    (d) Except as provided for under Sec. 1410.10(c), cost-share 
payments may be authorized for the replacement or restoration of 
practices for which cost-share assistance has been previously allowed 
under the CRP, only if:
    (1) Replacement or restoration of the practice is needed to achieve 
adequate erosion control, enhanced water quality, wildlife habitat, or 
increased protection of public wellheads; and
    (2) The failure of the original practice was due to reasons beyond 
the control of the participant.
    (e) The cost-share payment made to a participant shall not exceed 
the participant's actual contribution to the cost of establishing the 
practice and the amount of the cost-share may not be an amount which, 
when added to assistance from other sources, exceeds the cost of the 
practices.
    (f) CCC shall not make cost-share payments with respect to a CRP 
contract if any other Federal cost-share assistance has been, or is 
being, made with respect to the establishment of the cover crop on land 
subject to such contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.41  Levels and rates for cost-share payments.

    (a) As determined by the Deputy Administrator, CCC shall not pay 
more than 50 percent of the actual or average cost of establishing 
eligible practices specified in the conservation plan, except that CCC 
may allow cost-share payments for maintenance costs to the extent 
required by Sec. 1410.40 and CCC may determine the period and amount of 
such cost-share payments.
    (b) The average cost of performing a practice may be determined by 
CCC based on recommendations from the State Technical Committee. Such 
cost may be the average cost in a State, a county, or a part of a State 
or county, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) A one-time financial incentive, may be offered to participants 
who restore the hydrology of eligible wetlands in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1410.11(b) or other lands as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator; such incentives will not be greater than 25 percent of 
the cost of restoring such wetlands or other lands, as determined by 
CCC.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided, a participant may, in addition to 
any payment under this part, receive cost-share assistance, rental 
payments, or tax benefits from a State, subdivision of such State, or a 
private organization in return for enrolling lands in CRP. However, as 
provided under Sec. 1410.40(f) of this part, a participant may not 
receive or retain CRP cost-share assistance if other Federal cost-share 
assistance is provided for such acreage, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator. Further, under no circumstances may the cost-share 
payments received under this part, or otherwise, exceed the cost of the 
practice, as determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.42  Annual rental payments.

    (a) Subject to the availability of funds, annual rental payments 
shall be made in such amount and in accordance with such time schedule 
as may be agreed upon and specified in the CRP contract.
    (b) The annual rental payment shall be divided among the 
participants on a single contract in the manner agreed upon in such 
contract.
    (c) The maximum amount of rental payments which a person may receive 
under the CRP for any fiscal year shall not exceed $50,000. The 
regulations set forth at part 1400 of this chapter shall be applicable 
in making eligibility and ``person'' determinations as they apply to 
payment limitations under this part.
    (d) In the case of a contract succession, annual rental payments 
shall be divided between the predecessor and the successor participants 
as agreed to among the participants and approved by CCC. If there is no 
agreement among the participants, annual rental payments shall be 
divided in such manner deemed appropriate by the Deputy Administrator 
and such distribution may be based on the actual days of ownership of 
the property.
    (e) CCC shall, when appropriate, prepare a schedule for each county 
that shows the maximum soil rental rate

[[Page 361]]

CCC may pay which may be supplemented to reflect special contract 
requirements. As determined by the Deputy Administrator, such schedule 
will be calculated based on the relative productivity of soils within 
the county using NRCS data and local FSA average cash rental estimates. 
The schedule will be posted in the local FSA office. As determined by 
the Deputy Administrator, the schedule shall indicate, when appropriate, 
that:
    (1) Contracts offered by producers who request rental payments 
greater than the schedule for their soil(s) will be rejected;
    (2) Offers of contracts that are expected to provide especially high 
environmental benefits, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, may 
be accepted without further evaluation when the requested rental rate is 
less than or equal to the corresponding soil schedule; and
    (3) Otherwise qualifying offers shall be ranked competitively based 
on factors established under Sec. 1410.31 of this part in order to 
provide the most cost-effective environmental benefits, as determined by 
the Deputy Administrator.
    (f) Additional financial incentives may be provided to producers 
offering contracts expected to provide especially high environmental 
benefits through an increased annual rental payment or incentive payment 
as determined by the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.43  Method of payment.

Sec. 1410.50  State enhancement program.

    (a) For contracts to which a State, political subdivision, or agency 
thereof has succeeded in connection with an approved conservation 
reserve enhancement program, payments shall be made in the form of cash 
only. The provisions that limit the amount of payments per year that a 
person may receive under this part shall not be applicable to payments 
received by such State, political subdivision, or agency thereof in 
connection with agreements entered into under such enhancement programs 
carried out by such State, political subdivision, or agency thereof 
which has been approved for that purpose by CCC.
    (b) CCC may enter into other agreements in accordance with terms 
deemed appropriate by CCC, with States to use the CRP to cost-
effectively further specific conservation and environmental objectives 
of that State and the nation.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.51  Transfer of land.

    (a)(1) If a new owner or operator purchases or obtains the right and 
interest in, or right to occupancy of, the land subject to a CRP 
contract, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, such new owner or 
operator, upon the approval of CCC, may become a participant to a new 
CRP contract with CCC with respect to such transferred land.
    (2) With respect to the transferred land, if the new owner or 
operator becomes a successor to the existing CRP contract, the new owner 
or operator shall assume all obligations under the CRP contract of the 
previous participant.
    (3) If the new owner or operator becomes a successor to a CRP 
contract with CCC, then, except as otherwise determined appropriate by 
the Deputy Administrator:
    (i) Cost-share payments shall be made to the participant, past or 
present, who established the practice; and
    (ii) Annual rental payments to be paid during the fiscal year when 
the land was transferred shall be divided between the new participant 
and the previous participant in the manner specified in Sec. 1410.42.
    (b) If a participant transfers all or part of the right and interest 
in, or right to occupancy of, land subject to a CRP contract and the new 
owner or operator does not become a successor to such contract within 60 
days of such transfer, such contract shall be terminated with respect to 
the affected portion of such land and the original participant:

[[Page 362]]

    (1) Must forfeit all rights to any future payments with respect to 
such acreage;
    (2) Shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 1410.32(h); and
    (3) Refund all previous payments received under the contract by the 
participant or prior participants, plus interest, except as otherwise 
specified by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) Federal agencies acquiring property, by foreclosure or 
otherwise, that contains CRP contract acreage cannot be a party to the 
contract by succession. However, through an addendum to the CRP 
contract, if the current operator of the property is one of the 
participants on such contract, such operator may, as permitted by CCC, 
continue to receive payments provided for in such contract so long as:
    (1) The property is maintained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract;
    (2) Such operator continues to be the operator of the property; and
    (3) Ownership of the property remains with such federal agency.

    (2) If the CRP contract is terminated by CCC in accordance with this 
paragraph:
    (i) The participant shall forfeit all rights to further payments 
under such contract and refund all payments previously received together 
with interest; and
    (ii) Pay liquidated damages to CCC in such amount as specified in 
such contract.
    (b) If the Deputy Administrator determines such failure does not 
warrant termination of such contract, the Deputy Administrator may 
authorize relief as the Deputy Administrator deems appropriate.
    (c) CCC may reduce a demand for a refund under this section to the 
extent CCC determines that such relief would be appropriate and will not 
deter the accomplishment of the goals of the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.53  Executed CRP contract not in conformity with regulations.

    If, after a CRP contract is approved by CCC, it is discovered that

Department shall be applicable to this part, and may be considered as a 
basis to provide relief to persons subject to sanctions under this part 
to the extent that relief is not mandated by the other provisions of 
this section.
    (b) Further, except as provided in paragraph (b) (3) of this 
section, and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the 
Deputy Administrator may provide equitable relief to a participant who 
has entered into a contract under this chapter, and who is subsequently 
determined to be in violation of the contract, if the participant, in

advice of an authorized USDA representative, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, provided:
    (1) The Deputy Administrator determines that a participant has been

the applicable program under this chapter; or
    (v) Any other equitable relief the Deputy Administrator deems 
appropriate.
    (2) If relief under this section is authorized by the Deputy 
Administrator, the participant must take such actions

[[Page 363]]

as are determined by the Deputy Administrator to remedy any failure to 
comply with the contract.
    (3) This section shall not apply to a pattern of conduct, as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, in which an authorized USDA 
representative takes actions or provides advice with respect to a 
participant that the representative and the participant both know, or

of the CRP contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.56  Division of program payments and provisions relating to tenants and sharecroppers.

    (a) Payments received under this part shall be divided in the manner 
specified in the applicable contract or agreement and CCC shall ensure 
that producers who would have an interest in acreage being offered 
receive treatment which CCC deems to be equitable, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator. CCC may refuse to enter into a contract when there 
is a disagreement among persons seeking enrollment as to a person's 
eligibility to participate in the contract as a tenant and there is 
insufficient evidence to indicate whether the person seeking 
participation as a tenant does or does not have an interest in the 
acreage offered for enrollment in the CRP.
    (b) CCC may remove an operator or tenant from a CRP contract when 
the operator or tenant:
    (1) Requests, in writing to be removed from the CRP contract;
    (2) Files for bankruptcy and the trustee or debtor in possession 
fails to affirm the contract, to the extent permitted by the provisions 
of applicable bankruptcy laws;

requiring the removal from the CRP contract of the operator or tenant 
and such order is received by FSA, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (c) In addition to the provisions in paragraph (b) of this section, 
tenants shall maintain their tenancy throughout the contract period in 
order to remain on a contract. Tenants who fail to maintain tenancy on 
the acreage under contract, including failure to comply with provisions 
under applicable State law, may be removed from a contract by CCC. CCC 
shall assume the tenancy is being maintained unless notified otherwise 
by a CRP participant specified in the applicable contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.57  Payments not subject to claims.

    Subject to part 1403 of this chapter, any cost-share or annual

or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any part of any program 
payment otherwise due or paid such person during the applicable period 
may be required to be refunded with interest thereon as determined 
appropriate by CCC.
    (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, 
fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of cost-share 
assistance or annual rental payments, or obtaining a payment that 
otherwise would not be payable.
    (c) A new owner or operator or tenant of land subject to this part 
who succeeds to the responsibilities under this part shall report in 
writing to CCC any interest of any kind in the land subject to this part 
that is retained by a previous participant. Such interest shall include 
a present, future, or conditional interest, reversionary interest, or 
any option, future or present, with respect to such land, and any 
interest of any lender in such land where the lender has, will, or can 
obtain, a right of occupancy to such land or an interest in the equity 
in such land other than an interest in the appreciation in the value of 
such land occurring after the loan was made. Failure to fully disclose 
such interest shall be considered a scheme or device under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.61  Filing of false claims.

    If it is determined by CCC that any participant has knowingly 
supplied false information or has knowingly filed a false claim, such 
participant shall be ineligible for payments under this part with 
respect to the program year in which the false information or claim was 
filed and the contract may be terminated in which case a full refund of 
all prior payments may be demanded. False information or false claims 
include, but are not limited to, claims for payment for practices which 
do not meet the specifications of the applicable conservation plan. Any 
amounts paid under these circumstances shall be refunded, together with 
interest as determined by CCC, and any amounts otherwise due such 
participant shall be withheld. The remedies provided for in this section 
shall be in addition to any and all other remedies, criminal and/or 
civil that may apply.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, in the case of death, 
incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, any payment due under 
this part shall be paid to the participant's successor in accordance 
with the provisions of part 707 of this title.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in this part, payments under this 
part shall be subject to the requirements of part 12 of this title 
concerning highly-erodible land and wetland conservation and payments 
that otherwise could be made under this part may be withheld to the 
extent provided for in part 12 of this title.
    (c) Any remedies permitted CCC under this part shall be in addition 
to any other remedy, including, but not limited to criminal remedies, or 
actions for damages in favor of CCC, or the United States, as may be 
permitted by law; provided further the Deputy Administrator may add to 
the contract such additional terms as needed to enforce these 
regulations which shall be binding on the parties and may be enforced to 
the same degree as provisions of these regulations.
    (d) Absent a scheme or device to defeat the purpose of the program, 
when an owner loses control of CRP acreage due to foreclosure and the 
new owner chooses not to continue the contract in accordance with 
Sec. 1410.51, refunds shall not be required from any participant

[[Page 365]]

on the contract to the extent that the Deputy Administrator determines 
that forgiving such repayment is appropriate in order to provide fair 
and equitable treatment.
    (e) Crop insurance purchase requirements in part 1405 of this 
chapter apply to contracts executed in accordance with this part.
    (f) Land enrolled in CRP shall be classified as cropland for the 
time period enrolled in CRP and, after the time period of enrollment, 
may be removed from such classification upon a determination by the 
county committee that such land no longer meets the conditions 
identified in part 718 of this title.
    (g) Research projects may be submitted by the State committee and 
authorized by the Deputy Administrator to further the purposes of CRP. 
The research projects must include objectives that are consistent with 
this part, provide economic and environmental information not adversely 
affect local agricultural markets, and be conducted and monitored by a 
bona fide research entity.
    (h) CCC may enter into other agreements, as approved by the Deputy 
Administrator, to use the CRP to meet authorized wetland mitigation 
banking pilot projects.


<R05>

modifying any determination made by a State or county committee. The 
Deputy Administrator may waive or modify deadlines or other program 
requirements of this part to the extent that such a waiver or 
modification is otherwise permitted by law and is determined to be 
appropriate on the ground that it serves the goals of the program or 
other goals, and does not adversely affect the operation of the program.

                  Subpart B--Eligibility Determinations


<R05>
Sec. 1411.201  Eligible producers.

    (a) Section 202 of Public Law 106-224 authorizes the Secretary to 
make payments to a producer who planted an eligible oilseed in 2000. 
Accordingly, producers of the 2000 crop of oilseeds identified in 
Sec. 1411.103 are eligible to receive 2000 Oilseeds Program benefits, 
providing the producer meets the requirements of this part, and is in 
compliance with part 12 of this title regarding the conservation and 
protection of highly erodible lands and wetlands, and Sec. 718.11 of 
this title regarding denials of program benefits for activities relating 
to the use of controlled substances.
    (b) Eligibility determinations made under this part will be made for 
each producer separately for each specific eligible oilseed planted by 
that producer in 2000. A producer is not eligible for payment with 
respect to an oilseed that the producer did not plant in 2000 regardless 
of whether the producer did or did not plant that oilseed in 1997, 1998, 
or 1999.

<R05>
Sec. 1411.202  Violations, misrepresentation, or scheme or device.

    Any person who is determined to have intentionally misrepresented 
any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this 
part shall not be entitled to oilseed payments under this part and must 
refund all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with part 
1403 of this chapter (relating to debt settlement polices and 
procedures).


<R05>
Sec. 1411.203  Payment amount.

    Subject to the availability of funds, eligible persons can receive a 
payment under this part. The payment amount shall be equal to the 
payment rate established under this part multiplied by the producer's 
payment acreage multiplied, in turn, by the producer's payment yield. 
The payment rate shall be determined by DAFP after the level of program 
participation is known with sufficient clarity to allow for the 
calculation of the amount of payment that can be made, by unit of 
production, within the limits of the available funds. To the extent 
practicable, separate payment rates may be established for separate 
eligible oilseeds. Payments can be made only with respect to the 
production of eligible oilseeds.


<R05>
Sec. 1411.204  Payment acreage.

    (a) The oilseed payment acreage for an established producer shall, 
for a particular oilseed, be the higher of the three acreage amounts 
determined by calculating, for the 1997, 1998, and 1999 crops 
separately, the acreage determined to be equal to the producer's acreage 
for that oilseed at all locations for that crop year, adjusted to 
reflect interests that are only partial interests in such acreage.
    (b) The payment acreage for a new producer of an eligible oilseed 
will be the producer's acreage for that oilseed for the 2000 crop at all 
locations, adjusted to reflect interests that are only partial interests 
in such acreage.
    (c) Acreage not planted to an oilseed crop because of weather, or 
because of crop rotation practices or other management decisions, or 
because of any other reason, shall not be treated as qualifying 
production for determining a person's general eligibility for payment, a 
person's payment acreage, or for any other reason under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 1411.205  Payment yield.

    (a) For purposes of making yield determinations, under this part and 
for purposes of this section in particular, a producer's ``applicable 
average yield'' shall be, with respect to soybeans, the county average 
soybean yield. In the

[[Page 368]]

case of other oilseeds, the ``applicable average yield'' shall, for all 
persons qualifying for payment, be the national average oilseed yield 
for that oilseed. National and county average yields may be announced in 
advance of signup by DAFP.
    (b) A new producer's payment yield with respect to a particular 
eligible oilseed shall be the higher of the:
    (1) Applicable average yield for that oilseed or
    (2) Producer's actual yield for the 2000 crop year.
    (c) For established producers, the producer's payment yield for a 
particular oilseed shall be the higher of:
    (1) Applicable average yield; or
    (2) The highest for the 1997, 1998, and 1999 crops of the producer's 
actual yield respectively for those crop years for all acres of the 
oilseed planted by the producer.
    (d) In making determinations under paragraph (c) of this section for 
established producers, the choice of a crop year history will not be 
limited to the same history year chosen to set the producer's payment 
acres.
    (e) Where actual yields are used for purposes of establishing the 
producer's payment yields, the producer, if subject to a yield spot 
check or otherwise asked to do so, must document those actual yields 
using form FSA-658 and must establish those yields to the satisfaction 
of the county committee.
    (f) In making yield determinations, the producer's yields and 
payments may be adjusted by DAFP and the county and state committees, as 
necessary and practicable to reflect instances in which the producer has 
different yields at different locations and to reflect partial interests 
that the producer may have in some acreages.

of this section for the crop year, minus
    (2) The total contract acreage for all covered commodities 
determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (c) If the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section results in a 
negative number, the soybean and other oilseed acreage on the farm for 
that crop year shall be zero for the purposes of determining the 4-year 
average, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (d) If the acreage planted or prevented from being planted was 
devoted to a different covered commodity in the same crop year (other 
than a covered commodity produced under an established practice of 
double-cropping), the owner may select the commodity to be used for base 
purposes for that crop year in determining the 4-year average, but shall 
not select both the initial commodity and subsequent commodity.
    (e)(1) An owner may increase the eligible acres of soybeans and 
other oilseeds on a farm by reducing the contract acreage determined in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for one or more

the number of cropland acres reduced by a producer on a CCC-approved 
standard, uniform form designated by CCC in order to enroll such acres 
in a conservation reserve program contract entered into under section 
1231 of the 1985 Act. Eligible producers may adjust base acres only when 
the Conservation Reserve Program contract entered into under section 
1231 of the 1985 Act expires or is voluntarily terminated on or after 
May 13, 2002.
    (c) Subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, if neither 
paragraphs (a) nor (b) of this section apply, the Deputy Administrator 
may allow eligible producers to adjust base acres for covered 
commodities and peanuts with respect to the farm in a manner determined 
acceptable by the Deputy Administrator when a Conservation Reserve 
Program contract entered into under section 1231 of the 1985 Act expires 
or is voluntarily terminated on or after May 13, 2002.
    (d) The total base acreage on a farm shall not exceed the limitation 
in accordance with Sec. 1412.204.
    (e) Adjustments to base acreage on a farm in accordance with this 
section must be completed by no later than April 1 of the fiscal year 
following the fiscal year the conservation reserve program contract 
expired or was voluntarily terminated.
    (f) For the fiscal year in which an adjustment to base acres under 
this section is made, the owner of the farm shall elect to receive 
either direct payments and counter-cyclical payments with respect to the 
base acres added to the farm under this section or a prorated payment 
under the conservation reserve contract, but not both.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.204  Limitation of total base acreage on a farm.

    (a) The sum of the following shall not exceed the total DCP cropland 
acreage on the farm, plus approved double-cropped acreage for the farm:
    (1) The sum of all base acres established for the farm in accordance 
with this subpart, plus
    (2) Any base acres established for the farm for peanuts in 
accordance with subpart G of this part, plus
    (3) Any cropland acreage on the farm enrolled in a conservation 
reserve program contract in accordance with part 1410 of this chapter, 
plus
    (4) Any cropland acreage on the farm enrolled in a wetland reserve 
program contract in accordance with part 1467 of this chapter, plus
    (5) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a conservation program 
for which payments are made in exchange for not producing an 
agricultural commodity on the acreage.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator shall give the owner of the farm the 
opportunity to select the covered commodity base acres or peanut base 
acres, against which the reduction required in this section will be 
made.
    (c) In applying paragraph (a) of this section, CCC will take into 
account the practice of double cropping on a farm, as determined by CCC.

   Subpart C--Establishment of Yields for Direct and Counter-Cyclical 
                                Payments

    Source: 67 FR 64751, Oct. 21, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.301  Direct payment yields for covered commodities, except soybeans and other oilseeds.

    (a)(1) The direct payment yield for each covered commodity, except 
soybeans and other oilseeds, shall be the payment yield established for 
the commodity for the farm in accordance with the regulations for feed 
grain, rice, upland cotton and extra long staple cotton, wheat and 
related programs at part 1413 of this chapter in effect on January 1, 
1996 (see 7 CFR part 1413, revised as of January 1, 1996). CCC shall 
adjust the payment yield to reflect the additional payments made in 
accordance with 7 CFR 1413.15.
    (2) In the case of a farm for which a payment yield in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(1) of this section is unavailable for a covered 
commodity, except soybeans and other oilseeds, the county committee 
shall assign a payment yield for such covered commodity on the farm 
based upon the direct payment yield for such covered commodity on at 
least three similar farms physically located in the county with similar 
yield capability, including similar land and cultural practices.
    (i) If fewer than three similar farms are physically located in the 
county, the State committee shall assign a payment yield for such 
covered commodity based upon the direct payment yield for such covered 
commodity on at least three similar farms in the surrounding area with 
similar yield capability, including similar land and cultural practices, 
or as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (ii) Payment yields of similar farms shall be based on the farms' 
payment yields before such yields are updated in accordance with this 
section.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1412.302  Direct payment yield for soybeans and other oilseeds.

    (a) The direct payment yield for soybeans and each other oilseed for 
the farm shall be determined by multiplying the weighted average yield 
per planted acre for the crop on the farm, as determined in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, times the ratio resulting from:
    (1) The national average yield for the crop for the 1981 through 
1985 crop years, as determined by CCC, divided by
    (2) The national average yield for the crop for the 1998 through 
2001 crop years, as determined by CCC.
    (b)(1) The yield per planted acre for soybeans and each other 
oilseed on the farm, to be used for direct payment purposes, is 
calculated as follows:
    (i) The sum of the production of the crop for the 1998 through 2001 
crop years, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section; divided by
    (ii) The sum of the total planted acres of the crop for the 1998 
through 2001 crop years.
    (2) The production of the crop for each of the 1998 through 2001 
crop years shall be the higher of the following, except in a year in 
which the acreage planted to the crop was zero, in which case the 
production for the crop for such year shall be zero:
    (i) The total production for the applicable year based on the 
production evidence submitted in accordance with Sec. 1412.304; or
    (ii) The amount equal to the product of:
    (A) The total planted acres for the crop, times
    (B) 75 percent of the harvested average county yield for that crop 
determined, where practicable, by calculating the weighted 4-year 
average of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) harvested 
acreage yields for the crop using the 1998 through 2001 crop years.
    (3) The NASS harvested acreage yield to be used in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section shall be based on:
    (i) NASS harvested irrigated yield for the crop, if available, for 
producers who irrigated the crop in the applicable years;
    (ii) NASS harvested non-irrigated yield for the crop, if available, 
for producers who did not irrigate the crop in the applicable years; or

[[Page 375]]

    (iii) NASS harvested blended yield for all acreage, regardless of 
whether or not the acres were irrigated or non-irrigated, for all crops 
in all counties for which the yields in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section are unavailable.
    (4) If NASS harvested acreage yield data is not available, the 
Deputy Administrator shall assign a yield to be used in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.303  Payment yield for counter-cyclical payments for covered commodities.

    (a)(1) The counter-cyclical payment yield for covered commodities on 
the farm shall be equal to the direct payment yield for the covered 
commodity on the farm unless the owner elects to partially update the 
yield for all covered commodities on the farm in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Only owners who establish base acres for the farm in accordance 
with Sec. 1412.201(a)(1) shall have the opportunity to partially update 
the counter-cyclical payment yield for the covered commodities on the 
farm.
    (3) The partially updated yield shall be used for the calculation of 
the counter-cyclical payments only. The partially updated counter-
cyclical yield shall not be used for the calculation of any direct 
payments for any covered commodity.
    (4) Owners who elect to partially update counter-cyclical payment 
yields in accordance with this section must:
    (i) Make such election at the same time such owner makes the base 
election in accordance with Sec. 1412.201; and
    (ii) Update counter-cyclical payment yields for all covered 
commodities on the farm using the same method. Updating counter-cyclical 
payment yields for fewer than all covered commodities on the farm is not 
allowed. Updating counter-cyclical payment yields for covered 
commodities on a farm using different methods for different covered 
commodities is not allowed.
    (b) Owners on a farm who established base acres for the farm in 
accordance with Sec. 1412.201(a)(1) may select one of the following 
methods to partially update counter-cyclical payment yields for all 
covered commodities on the farm. The same method must be used to 
partially update the counter-cyclical payment yield for all covered 
commodities on the farm.
    (1) The sum of the following:
    (i) The payment yield calculated for the covered commodity in 
accordance with Secs. 1412.301 or 1412.302, as applicable, plus
    (ii) 70 percent of the result of:
    (A) The average yield per planted acre for the crop on the farm, as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, minus
    (B) The payment yield calculated for the covered commodity in 
accordance with Secs. 1412.301 or 1412.302, as applicable.
    (2) 93.5 percent of the average yield per planted acre for the crop 
on the farm, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c)(1) The yield per planted acre for covered commodities on the 
farm is calculated as follows:
    (i) The sum of the production of the crop for 1998 through 2001 crop 
years, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, divided by
    (ii) The sum of the total planted acres of the crop for the 1998 
through 2001 crop years.
    (2) The production of the crop for each of the 1998 through 2001 
crop years shall be the higher of the following, except in a year in 
which the acreage planted to the crop was zero, in which case, the 
production for the crop for such year shall be zero:
    (i) The total production for the applicable year based on the 
production evidence submitted in accordance with Sec. 1412.304; or
    (ii) The amount equal to the product of:
    (A) The total planted acres for the crop, times
    (B) 75 percent of the harvested average county yield for that crop 
determined, where practicable, by calculating the weighted 4-year 
average of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) harvested 
acreage yields for the crop using the 1998 through 2001 crop years.
    (3) The NASS harvested acreage yield to be used in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section shall be based on:

[[Page 376]]

    (i) NASS harvested irrigated yield for the crop, if available, for 
producers who irrigated the crop in the applicable years;
    (ii) NASS harvested non-irrigated yield for the crop, if available, 
for producers who did not irrigate the crop in the applicable years; or
    (iii) NASS harvested blended yield for all acreage, regardless of 
whether or not the acres were irrigated or non-irrigated, for all crops 
in all counties where the yields in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section are unavailable.
    (4) If NASS harvested acreage yield data is not available, the 
Deputy Administrator shall assign a yield to be used in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.304  Submitting production evidence.

    (a)(1) Reports of production evidence must be submitted by producers 
when the owner elects to:
    (i) Partially update the yield for all covered commodities on the 
farm in accordance with Sec. 1412.303; or
    (ii) Establish a direct payment yield for soybeans or other oilseeds 
for the farm in accordance with Sec. 1412.302.
    (2) Producer or third-party certification shall not be accepted as 
proof of production evidence.
    (3) Reports of production evidence for all covered commodities shall 
be provided to the county committee of the county where the farm is 
administratively located, by farm and crop in such manner as required by 
CCC on a CCC-approved standard, uniform form designated by CCC.
    (b)(1) When disposition of production has been through commercial 
channels, CCC may require the producer to furnish documentary evidence 
in order to verify the information provided on the report of production. 
Acceptable evidence may include, but is not limited to, such items as:
    (i) Production approved by the county committee for Loan Deficiency 
Payments;
    (ii) Commercial receipts;
    (iii) Gin records;
    (iv) Settlement sheets;
    (v) Warehouse ledger sheets;
    (vi) Elevator receipts or load summaries, supported by other 
evidence showing disposition, such as sales documents;
    (vii) Evidence from harvested or appraised acreage, approved for 
FCIC or multi-peril crop insurance loss adjustment settlement; or
    (viii) Other production evidence determined acceptable by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (2) Such production evidence must show:
    (i) The producer's name,
    (ii) The commodity,
    (iii) The buyer or name of storage facility,
    (iv) The Date of transaction or delivery, and
    (v) The quantity.
    (c) When production of a covered commodity has been disposed of 
through non-commercial channels, such as used for feed, grazing, or 
silage, if Loan Deficiency Payments are not available, but crop 
insurance records or other FSA records indicate that the use of the crop 
was for silage, hay, or grazing, then county committee will assign 
production for that year based on the actual grain yield of three 
similar farms for the applicable year. If producers cannot meet any of 
these requirements or their crop suffered a low yield, then 75 percent 
of the county average yield as determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1412.302(b)(4) will be used.
    (d) CCC may verify the production evidence submitted with records on 
file at the warehouse, gin, or other entity which received or may have 
received the reported production.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.305  Incorrect or false production evidence.

    (a) If production evidence is false or incorrect, as determined by 
the county committee, the county committee shall determine whether the 
owner or producer submitting the production evidence for a farm acted in 
good faith or took action to defeat the purpose of the program.
    (b)(1) If the county committee determines the production evidence 
submitted is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, and the owner or 
producer who submitted the evidence did not act in good faith or took 
action to defeat the purpose of the program, the county committee shall:

[[Page 377]]

    (i) Require a refund of all direct and counter-cyclical payments 
earned for the farm for the first year such payments were made;
    (ii) Reduce the counter-cyclical payment yields for all crops on the 
farm to equal the direct payment yield for all crops except oilseeds. 
For all oilseeds on the farm, both the direct and counter-cyclical 
payment yields shall be reduced to 75 percent of the county average 
yield as determined in accordance with Sec. 1412.302(b)(4). That yield 
shall then be reduced by the applicable direct payment yield factor in 
accordance with Sec. 1412.302(a)(1); and
    (iii) Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, require a 
refund of an amount equal to the following for each covered commodity 
and peanuts for each year the false, incorrect or unacceptable yield was 
used to make payments under the contract:
    (A) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments made using 
the false, incorrect or unacceptable evidence, minus
    (B) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments that would 
have been made based on the yields established in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the county 
committee determines that the production evidence submitted is false, 
incorrect, or unacceptable, and the owner or producer who submitted the 
evidence did not act in good faith or took action to defeat the purpose 
of the program, the Deputy Administrator may take further action, 
including but not limited to any or all of the following:
    (i) Make a further yield reduction for part or all of the covered 
commodities and peanuts on the farm;
    (ii) Make further payment reductions or refunds;
    (iii) Determine that the owner or producer who submitted the 
evidence is ineligible for participation in future contracts; or
    (iv) Take other legal action.
    (c) If the county committee determines the production evidence 
submitted is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, and the owner or 
producer who submitted the evidence acted in good faith and did not take 
action to defeat the purpose of the program, the county committee shall:
    (1) Correct the counter-cyclical yield for the applicable crop to 
equal the yield that would have been calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 1412.303 based on accurate production evidence; and
    (2) Require a refund of an amount equal to the following for each 
covered commodity and peanuts for each year the false, incorrect or 
unacceptable yield was used to make payments under the contract:
    (i) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments made using 
the false, incorrect or unacceptable evidence, minus
    (ii) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments that would 
have been made based on the yields established in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1412.401  Direct and counter-cyclical program contract.

    (a)(1) With respect to Fiscal Year 2002 payments, CCC will offer to 
enter into a contract with eligible producers of covered commodities and 
historical peanut producers on October 1, 2002 through the date 
announced by CCC. With respect to Fiscal Years 2003 through 2007, CCC 
shall offer to annually enter into a contract with an eligible producer 
on a farm having base acreage with respect to a covered commodity; and 
for a farm with peanut base acreage and yield assigned in accordance 
with subpart G of this part, at the beginning of each such fiscal year 
2003 through 2007 through the date announced by CCC for each such year.
    (2)(i) Eligible producers may execute and submit a contract to the 
county FSA office where the records for the farm are administratively 
maintained not later than June 1 of the fiscal year

[[Page 378]]

in which the direct and counter-cyclical payments are requested.
    (ii) Because CCC will incur additional expenses which may not be 
possible to quantify with certainty, including the additional cost to 
ensure payments are issued timely to all producers, a late signup fee in 
the amount of $100 per farm will be assessed by CCC for any farm 
enrolled after June 1 of the fiscal year in which the direct and 
counter-cyclical payments are requested unless the Deputy Administrator 
determines a waiver of the late signup fee is appropriate. Enrollment is 
not allowed after September 30 of the fiscal year in which the direct 
and counter-cyclical payments are requested.
    (3) Eligible producers who elect to enter into a contract with CCC 
must enroll all base acres on the farm. Enrollment of fewer than all 
base acres on the farm is not allowed.
    (b) Eligible producers may withdraw from a contract at any time on 
or before September 30 of the year of the contract provided all 
signatories to the contract, including CCC, agree to the withdraw.
    (c) All contracts shall expire on September 30 of the fiscal year of 
the contract unless:
    (1) Withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) Terminated in accordance with paragraphs (d) or (e) of this 
section; or
    (3) Terminated at an earlier date by mutual consent of all parties, 
including CCC.
    (d) A transfer or change in the interest of an owner or producer in 
the farm or in acreage on the farm subject to a contract shall result in 
the termination of the contract, and a refund of all direct and counter-
cyclical payments issued for the farm. The contract termination shall be 
effective on the date of the transfer or change. Successors to the 
interest in the farm or crops on the farm subject to the contract may 
enroll the farm in a new contract and assume all obligations under the 
contract, only after all direct and counter-cyclical payments previously 
issued for the farm have been refunded to CCC.
    (e) In the event a farm reconstitution is completed in accordance 
with part 718 of this title, all producers with an interest in the base 
acres on the farm must sign a new contract and provide supporting 
documentation as specified in part 12 of this title, and parts 1400, and 
1412 of this chapter not later than September 30 of the fiscal year 
direct and counter-cyclical payments are requested, after receiving 
written notification by the county committee indicating the 
reconstitution is completed. If all producers have not signed the new 
contract by September 30, no producers on the contract will be eligible 
for a direct or counter-cyclical payment for that farm for the year the 
contract was terminated.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.402  Eligible producers.

    Producers eligible to enter into a contract are:
    (a)(1) An owner of a farm who assumes all or a part of the risk of 
producing a crop;
    (2) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm with a share-rent 
lease for such farm, regardless of the length of the lease, if the owner 
of the farm enters into the same contract;
    (3) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm who cash rents such 
farm under a lease expiring on or after September 30 of the year of the 
contract in which case the owner is not required to enter into the 
contract;
    (4) A producer, other than an owner, on an eligible farm who cash 
rents such farm under a lease expiring before September 30 of the year 
of the contract. The owner of such farm must also enter into the same 
contract; or
    (5) An owner of an eligible farm who cash rents such farm and the 
lease term expires before September 30 of the year of the contract, if 
the tenant declines to enter into a contract for the applicable year. In 
the case of an owner covered by this paragraph, direct and counter-
cyclical payments shall not begin under the contract until the lease 
held by the tenant ends.
    (b) A minor child shall be eligible to enter into a contract only if 
one of the following conditions exist:
    (1) The right of majority has been conferred upon the minor by court 
proceedings or statute;
    (2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property, 
and the

unless such owner or producer requests in writing that such owner or 
producer not be furnished with the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.405  Reducing base acreage.

    (a)(1) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (a)(ii) of this 
section, a permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base 
acreage shall be allowed when all owners of the farm execute and submit 
a written request for such reduction on a CCC-approved standard, uniform 
form designated by CCC to the FSA county office where the records for 
the farm are administratively maintained.
    (2) A permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base 
acreage to negate or reduce a program violation is not allowed.
    (b) When base acres on a farm are converted to a non-agricultural 
commercial or industrial use, the total base acreage on the farm shall 
be reduced accordingly regardless of the submission of a request for 
such reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.406  Succession-in-interest to a direct and counter-cyclical program contract.

succession will not adversely affect nor defeat the purpose of the 
program.
    (b) A succession in interest to the contract is not permitted if CCC 
determines that the change:
    (1) Results in a violation of the landlord-tenant provisions set 
forth in Sec. 1412.505; or
    (2) Adversely affects or otherwise defeats the purpose of the 
program.
    (c) If a producer who is entitled to receive direct and counter-
cyclical payments dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to 
receive the payment, CCC will make the payment in accordance with part 
707 of this title.
    (d) A producer or owner must inform the county committee of changes 
in interest in base acres on the farm not later than:
    (1) August 1 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the 
change requires a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 
718 of this title; or
    (2) September 30 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if 
the change does not require a reconstitution be completed in accordance 
with part 718 of this title.
    (e)(1) In any case in which either a direct or counter-cyclical 
payment has previously been made to a predecessor, such payment shall 
not be paid to the successor, unless such payment has been refunded in 
full by the predecessor, in accordance with Sec. 1412.401(d). If the 
predecessor refunds such payments, such producer shall not be assessed 
interest in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.
    (2) A succession in interest shall not increase the liability of 
CCC.

lentils, mung beans, and dry peas) or wild rice, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator, is prohibited on base acreage of a farm enrolled 
in a contract.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
perennial fruits, vegetables and wild rice may be planted on base 
acreage of a farm enrolled in a contract, and non-perennial fruits, 
vegetables and wild rice may be harvested on base acreage of a farm 
enrolled in a contract if:
    (1) A producer double-crops fruits, vegetables or wild rice with a

this section, in which case direct and counter-cyclical payments will 
not be reduced for the planting or harvesting of the fruit, vegetable or 
wild rice;
    (2) The farm has a history of planting fruits, vegetables or wild 
rice, as determined by CCC, in which case the payment acres for the farm 
shall be reduced on an acre-for-acre basis ; or
    (3) The producer has a history of planting a specific fruit, 
specific vegetable or wild rice, as determined by CCC, the producer may 
plant and harvest the specific fruit, specific vegetable or wild rice 
for which the producer has a planting history, subject to the following:

the fiscal year following the fiscal year of the contract in which the 
direct payment was earned.
    (b) For 2003 through 2007 contracts, at the option of the producer, 
50 percent of the direct payment for the farm with respect to covered 
commodities and peanuts for which payment yields and base acres are 
established, shall be paid in any month from December through September

accordance with this paragraph, then no producer shall be eligible for 
any payment for that farm for that contract.

ineligible for all or any part of the producer's share of the direct 
payment computed for the farm in accordance with the provisions of this 
section:

a contract with respect to the covered commodities and peanuts for which 
payment yields and base acres are established shall be equal to the 
product of:

    (1) The payment rate specified in paragraph (d) of this section, 
multiplied by
    (2) The payment acres of the covered commodity and peanuts on the 
farm enrolled in a contract, minus any acre reduction in accordance with 
Sec. 1412.407(g), multiplied by
    (3) The payment yield for the covered commodity and peanuts on the 
farm enrolled in a contract as determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1412.301, Sec. 1412.302 and subpart G of this part, minus
    (4) Any reduction calculated in accordance with subpart F of this 
part, minus
    (5) Any advance payment received in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section.

    (f) For 2002 contracts, the direct payment amount to be paid to the 
producers on a farm enrolled in a contract with respect to the covered 
commodities for which payment yields and base acres are established 
shall be equal to the result of the amount calculated in accordance with 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section minus all of the 
following:
    (1) Any amount of payment received under a production flexibility 
contract for fiscal year 2002 in accordance with the Federal Agriculture 
Improvement and Reform Act of 1996;
    (2) Any reduction calculated in accordance with subpart F of this 
part, with credit for any amount reduced under the production 
flexibility contract for the farm for fiscal year 2002 for the same 
contract violation; and
    (3) Any reduction calculated in accordance with Sec. 1412.407(j).
    (g)(1) The payment of any amount due any producer on a farm enrolled 
in

[[Page 385]]

a contract shall be made only after all the producers subject to the 
contract are determined to be in full compliance with the contract and 
the requirements in this part.
    (2) A producer on a farm enrolled in a contract may receive a 
payment amount due without respect to the eligibility of other producers 
on the farm if:
    (i) The producer is in full compliance with the contract and the 
requirements in this part;
    (ii) The payment of such amount does not affect adversely nor defeat 
the purpose of the program, as determined by the Deputy Administrator; 
and
    (iii) The payment is approved by the Deputy Administrator.

Sec. 1412.504  Sharing of contract payments.

    (a) Each eligible producer on a farm shall be given the opportunity 
to annually enroll in a contract and receive direct and counter-cyclical 
payments determined to be fair and equitable as agreed to by all the 
producers on the farm and approved by the county committee.
    (1) Each producer must provide a copy of their written lease to the 
county committee and, in the absence of a written lease, must provide to 
the county committee a complete written description of the terms and 
conditions of any oral agreement or lease.
    (2) A lease will be considered to be a cash lease if the lease 
provides for only a guaranteed sum certain cash payment, or a fixed 
quantity of the crop (for example, cash, pounds, or bushels per acre).
    (3) If a lease contains provisions that require the payment of rent 
on the basis of the amount of crop produced or the proceeds derived from 
the crop, or the interest such producer would have had if the crop had 
been produced, or combination thereof, such agreement shall be 
considered to be a share lease. The leasing of grazing or haying 
privileges is not considered cash leasing.
    (4) If a lease provides for the greater of a guaranteed amount or 
share of the crop or crop proceeds, such agreement shall be considered a 
share lease if the lease provides for both:
    (i) A guaranteed amount such as a fixed dollar amount or quantity; 
and
    (ii) A share of the crop proceeds.
    (5) If the lease is a cash lease, the landlord is not eligible for 
direct or counter-cyclical payments.
    (b) When contract acreage is leased on a share basis, neither the 
landlord nor the tenant shall receive 100 percent of the contract 
payment for the farm.
    (c) CCC will approve a contract for enrollment and approve the 
division of payment when all of the following apply:
    (1) The landlords, tenants and sharecroppers sign the contract and 
agree to the payment shares shown on the contract;
    (2) CCC determines that the interests of tenants and sharecroppers 
are being protected; and

[[Page 388]]

    (3) CCC determines that the payment shares shown on the contract do 
not circumvent the provisions of part 1400 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.505  Provisions relating to tenants and sharecroppers.

    Neither direct nor counter-cyclical payments shall be made by CCC 
if:
    (a) The landlord or operator has adopted a scheme or device for the 
purpose of depriving any tenant or sharecropper of the payments to which 
such person would otherwise be entitled under the program. If any of 
such conditions occur or are discovered after payments have been made, 
all or any such part of the payments as the State committee may 
determine shall be refunded to CCC; or
    (b) The landlord terminated a lease in violation of state law as 
determined by a state court.

<R05>
Sec. 1412.601  Contract violations.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, violations 
of contract requirements shall result in the termination of the 
contract. Upon such termination, all producers subject to the contract 
shall forfeit all rights to receive direct and counter-cyclical payments 
on the farm for the contract year and shall refund all direct and 
counter-cyclical payments received, plus interest, as determined in 
accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) If there is a violation of Sec. 1412.407 and CCC determines 
that a violation is not serious enough to warrant termination of the 
contract under paragraph (a) of this section, direct and counter-
cyclical payments may be made to the producers specified on the 
contract, but in an amount that is reduced by an amount equal to the sum 
of:
    (i) The per-acre market value of the fruits, vegetables, and wild 
rice, as determined by the State Committee, times the number of acres in 
violation, plus
    (ii) The direct and counter-cyclical payments for each such acre.
    (2) Producers must protect land enrolled in DCP from weeds, 
including noxious weeds, and erosion, including providing sufficient 
cover if determined necessary by the county committee. The first 
violation of this provision will result in a reduction in the direct 
payments for the farm by an amount equal to three times the cost of 
maintenance of the acreage, but not to exceed 50 percent of the total 
direct payments for the farm. The second violation of this provision 
will result in a reduction in the direct payments for the farm by an 
amount equal to three times the cost of maintenance of the acreage, not 
to exceed the total direct payments for the farm.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.602  Fruit, vegetable and wild rice acreage reporting violations.

    (a)(1) If an acreage report of fruits, vegetables or wild rice 
planted on base acreage of a farm enrolled in DCP is inaccurate but 
within tolerance as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and CCC 
determines the producer made a good faith effort to comply with the 
provisions of this section, the producers shall accept a reduction in 
the direct and counter-cyclical payments for each such acre.
    (2) If an acreage report of fruits, vegetables or wild rice planted 
on base acreage of a farm enrolled in DCP is inaccurate and exceeds the 
tolerance as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, but CCC 
determines the producer made a good faith effort to comply with the 
provisions of this section, the producers shall accept a reduction in 
the direct and counter-cyclical payments for the farm in an amount equal 
to the sum of:
    (i) The direct and counter-cyclical payments for each such acre, 
plus
    (ii) Twice the average dollar value of the direct payment for the 
covered commodity and peanut base acreage reduced because of the fruit, 
vegetable, and wild rice plantings on such acreage, multiplied by the 
total number of acres in violation.

[[Page 389]]

    (3) The contract shall be terminated if an acreage report of fruits, 
vegetables or wild rice planted on base acreage of a farm enrolled in 
DCP is inaccurate, and the county committee determines the producer did 
not make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of this 
section. Upon such termination, producers subject to such contract 
shall:
    (i) Forfeit all rights to receive direct and counter-cyclical 
payments for the farm;
    (ii) Refund all direct and counter-cyclical payments received for 
the farm, plus interest as determined in accordance with part 1403 of 
this chapter; and
    (iii) Be ineligible for all program benefits according to part 718 
of this title.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, tolerance is the amount by 
which the determined acreage may differ from the reported acreage and 
still be considered in compliance with program requirements. Tolerance 
for fruits, vegetables and wild rice plantings is 5 percent of the 
reported fruit, vegetable and wild rice acreage, not to exceed 50 acres.

must refund all such payments received, plus interest as determined in 
accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.
    (b) A producer shall refund to CCC all direct and counter-cyclical 
payments, plus interest as determined in accordance with part 1403 of 
this chapter, received by such producer with respect to all contracts if 
the producer is determined to have knowingly done any of the following. 
In addition, the producer's interest in all such contracts shall be 
terminated.
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or

lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found at part 1403 of this chapter

Sec. 1412.701  Determination of 4-year peanut acreage average.

    (a) The Deputy Administrator shall determine, for each historic 
peanut producer under this part, the 4-year average of the following:
    (1) The acreage planted to peanuts on each farm on which the 
historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 
through 2001 crop years; and
    (2) Any acreage on each farm that the historic peanut producer was 
prevented from planting to peanuts during the 1998 through 2001 crop 
years because of natural disaster, or any other condition beyond the 
control of the historic peanut producers, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (b) For the purposes of determining the 4-year acreage average for a 
historic peanut producer under this part, the Deputy Administrator shall 
not exclude any crop year in which the producer did not plant peanuts.
    (c) If more than one historic peanut producer shared in the risk of 
producing the crop on a farm, the historic peanut producers shall 
receive the proportional share of the number of acres planted or 
prevented from being planted to peanuts for harvest on the farm, based 
on the sharing arrangement that was in effect among the producers for 
the crop.
    (d) When a historic peanut producer is no longer living or when an 
entity composed of historic peanut producers has been dissolved, and in 
other similar situations, the Deputy Administrator shall make the base 
determinations under this subpart in the manner determined to be fair 
and reasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.702  Determination of average peanut yield.

    (a) The Deputy Administrator shall determine, for each historic 
peanut producer, the average yield for peanuts on each farm the historic 
peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 
crop years, excluding any crop year in which the producer did not plant 
or was prevented from planting peanuts. Production information reported 
according to part 729 of this chapter will be used by the Deputy 
Administrator for determining yields under this section.
    (b)(1) For the purposes of determining the 4-year average yield for 
a historic peanut producer under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
historic peanut producer may elect to substitute for a farm for not more 
than 3 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years in which the historic peanut 
producer planted peanuts on the farm, the average harvested yield for 
peanuts produced in the county in which the farm is located for the 1990 
through 1997 crop years.
    (2) The average harvested yield for peanuts produced in a county 
which will be used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be the NASS 
irrigated and non-irrigated yields or, in States and counties where the 
irrigated and non-irrigated NASS data is unavailable, the NASS blended 
yield for the county.
    (3) If NASS harvested peanut yield data is unavailable, for the 
purposes set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the harvested 
county average peanut yield, determined according to peanut production 
information reported according to part 729 of this chapter, shall be 
used.
    (c) The average harvested yield, to be used at the producer's option 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall be determined by calculating 
the weighted 7-year average for each type of yield for the years 1990 
through 1997 of:
    (1) The NASS harvested peanut irrigated yield for the county for 
each year;
    (2) The NASS harvested peanut non-irrigated yield for the county for 
each year;
    (3) The NASS harvested peanut blended yield for all counties where 
the yields in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section are 
unavailable for each year for all acreage regardless of whether or not 
the acres were irrigated or nonirrigated;
    (4) The average yield for the county, determined in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section for each year.

opportunity to assign the average peanut yield determined in accordance 
with Sec. 1412.702 and average acreage determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1412.701 for each farm of the historic peanut producer to cropland 
on that farm or another farm in the same State or a contiguous State.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the average 
acreage determined under Sec. 1412.701 for a farm may be assigned to a 
farm in a contiguous county only if either of the following apply:
    (1) The historic peanut producer making the assignment produced 
peanuts in that State during at least one of the 1998 through 2001 crop 
years; or
    (2) As of March 31, 2003, the historic peanut producer is a producer 
on a farm in that State.
    (c) The Deputy Administrator shall provide notice to historic peanut 
producers regarding the opportunity to assign average peanut yields and 
average acreages to farms under paragraph (a) of this section. The 
notice shall provide the following information:
    (1) Notice that the opportunity to make the assignments is being 
provided only once;
    (2) A description of the limitations in paragraph (b) of this 
section on their ability to make their assignments; and

submit to the Deputy Administrator notice of the assignments made by the 
producer under this section. If a historic peanut producer fails to 
submit such notice by that date, that base and yield shall be assigned 
to the most recent farm associated with such base and yield, as 
determined by FSA records.
    (e) The average of all yields assigned by a historic peanut producer 
under paragraph (a) of this section to a farm shall be considered to be 
the payment yield for that farm for the purpose of making direct and 
payments and counter-cyclical payments under this part, beginning with 
crop year 2003.
    (f) Subject to paragraph (g) of this section, the total number acres 
assigned by historic peanut producers under paragraph (b) of this 
section to a farm shall be considered to be the farm's base acres for

temporary transfers;
    (2) Be a party to a written contract for the purchase of all or a 
portion of the farm identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that 
was in effect on or before May 13, 2002. If the parties to the contract 
are unable to agree to the division of the applicable peanut quota on 
the land subject to the written contract, the Deputy Administrator, 
taking into account any incomplete or permanent transfer of the peanut 
quota that has otherwise been agreed to, shall provide for the equitable 
division of the payments made under this part by determining the 
eligible peanut quota holders and allocating the disputed amount of the 
peanut quota to such holders. This allocation will take into account the 
ratio of cropland on the unsold portion of the farm and the cropland on 
the portion of the farm subject to the purchase contract;
    (3) Be a party to a written contract that was in effect on or before 
May 13, 2002, for the permanent transfer of a peanut quota to such 
party's farm but was not completed by that date. In such a case, the 
eligible peanut quota holder is the owner of the farm, as of May 13, 
2002, to which the peanut quota was to be transferred; or
    (4) Have owned a farm with a peanut quota which is protected under a 
Conservation Reserve Program contract in accordance with part 1410 of 
this chapter;
    (b) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (a) of this section, 
CCC may determine that a person is an eligible peanut quota holder with 
respect to an amount of peanut quota for the purposes of this section, 
to the exclusion of all other persons in order to provide for the fair 
and equitable administration of this part so long as the total amount of 
eligible quota pounds for all program participants does not exceed the 
quantity of peanut quota that was available to all quota holders in the 
2001 crop year.
    (c) Sales and transfers of farms and peanut quotas may be 
disregarded by CCC when:
    (1) Such sales and transfers were required to be reported to FSA 
under part 729 of this title; or
    (2) It is otherwise determined by CCC that it would be unfair and 
inequitable in the overall administration of the program to make or 
modify an eligibility determination based on claims of transfers or 
sales that preceded January 1, 2002.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.807  Contract provisions.

    (a)(1) CCC will, on a per-farm basis, offer to enter into a contract 
with each eligible peanut quota holder on such farm under which CCC will 
provide a payment in five equal installments in each of the 2002 though 
2006 fiscal years or in one lump sum payment in any such fiscal year as 
selected by such holder.
    (2) Eligible peanut quota holders who elect to receive five equal 
installments payments will receive the fiscal year 2002 payment no later 
than December 31, 2002 and, as determined by CCC, between January 2 and 
January 31 in each of the years 2003 through 2006.
    (3) Eligible peanut quota holders who elect to receive one lump sum 
payment may specify the fiscal year in which they wish to receive a 
payment. CCC will determine the day in such fiscal year that the payment 
will be made by CCC.
    (b) The amount of each payment made under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section shall be the product determined by multiplying:
    (1) $0.11 per pound; times

[[Page 394]]

    (2) The amount of eligible quota pounds of the eligible peanut quota 
holder.
    (c) The amount of each payment made under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section shall be the product determined by multiplying the product 
determined under paragraph (b) of this section times five.
    (d) After a payment option has been selected under paragraph (a) of 
this section and a payment has been made by CCC, no change in the 
payment option will be allowed except as authorized by the Executive 
Vice President, CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.808  Contract liability.

    All signatories to a contract are jointly and severally liable for 
contract violations and resulting repayments and liquidated damages.

Sec. 1421.809  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    A person who is determined to have:
    (a) Erroneously represented any fact affecting a program 
determination made in accordance with this subpart;
    (b) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program; or
    (c) Made any fraudulent representation affecting a program 
determination made in accordance with this subpart, must refund all 
payments received on all contracts entered into under this subpart, plus 
interest as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, and 
pay to CCC liquidated damages as specified in the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.810  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof made to any person under this subpart shall be made 
without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard 
to any claim or lien against the peanut quota or the farm for which a 
peanut quota had been established under part 729 of this title by any 
creditor or any other person.
    (b) Any person eligible to receive a payment made under this subpart 
may assign the payment in accordance with part 1404 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.811  Other regulations.

    (a) The provisions of part 12 of this title, the controlled 
substance provisions of part 718 of this title, and the payment 
limitation provisions of part 1400 of this chapter shall not be 
applicable to payments made under this subpart.
    (b) The provisions of part 707 of this title relating to the making 
of payments in the event of the death of a program participant and in 
the event of other special circumstances shall apply to payments made 
under this subpart.

through 2007 crops of barley, small chickpeas, corn, grain sorghum, 
lentils, oats, dry peas, peanuts, rice, wheat, wool, mohair, oilseeds 
and other crops designated by Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). These 
regulations set forth the general provisions under which marketing 
assistance loans and loan deficiency payments (LDP) will be administered 
by the CCC. Additional terms and conditions are in the note and security 
agreement and the loan deficiency payment application that must be 
executed by a producer to receive marketing assistance loans and LDP's.
    (b)(1) The basic loan rates, the schedule of premiums and discounts, 
and forms applicable to the marketing assistance and loan deficiency 
payment programs for the commodities specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section are available in Farm Service Agency (FSA) State and county 
offices. The forms for use in these programs will be prescribed by CCC.
    (2) Loan deficiency payments shall be available for unshorn pelts, 
hay and silage.
    (c) Marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments will not 
be available for any commodity produced on land owned or otherwise in 
the possession of the United States if such land is occupied without the

    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and employees 
thereof, cannot modify or waive any requirement of this part, except as 
provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) The State committee shall take any required action not taken by 
the county committee. The State committee shall also:
    (1) For the 2001 crop year only, allow producers who violated the 
terms and conditions of the note and security agreement which resulted 
in the producer losing beneficial interest in the commodity before 
repaying the loan and the county committee determined the producer acted 
in good faith, to repay the loan at a rate that is the lesser of the 
loan plus interest; or the alternative repayment rate, as determined 
under Sec. 1421.10, in effect on the date the beneficial interest was 
lost. In cases, where a locked-in repayment rate under Sec. 1421.110 was 
applicable, the

prescribed form is considered null and void.
    (2) Correct or require correction of an action taken by a county 
committee that is not in compliance with this part; or
    (3) Require a county committee to not take an action or implement a 
decision that is not under the regulations of this part.
    (d) The Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, may determine 
any question arising under these programs, or reverse or modify a 
determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize 
State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other 
program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such 
other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the 
marketing assistance loan and loan deficiency payment program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute marketing assistance loan 
and loan deficiency payment applications and related documents only 
under the terms and conditions determined and announced by CCC. Any 
document not executed under such terms and conditions, including any 
purported execution before the date authorized by CCC, shall be null and 
void.

[[Page 399]]

other quality factors, including the determination of type, quality, and

time of delivery to CCC by a Federal or State Inspector authorized or 
licensed by the Secretary.

eligible or ineligible commodity measured by a representative of the 
county FSA service center at the producer's expense, before commingling.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.6  Beneficial interest.

    (a)(1) To be eligible to receive marketing assistance loans or loan 
deficiency payments, a producer must have the beneficial interest in the 
commodity that is tendered to CCC for a marketing assistance loan or 
loan deficiency payment. The producer must always have had the 
beneficial interest in the commodity unless, before the commodity was 
harvested, sheared or slaughtered in the case of unshorn pelts, the 
producer, and a former producer whom the producer tendering the 
commodity to CCC has succeeded, had such an interest in the commodity. 
Commodities obtained by gift, barter or purchase shall not be eligible 
to be tendered to CCC for marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency 
payments. Heirs who succeed to the beneficial interest of a deceased 
producer or who assume the decedent's obligations under an existing 
marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment shall be eligible 
to receive marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments 
whether succession to the commodity occurs before or after harvest, 
shearing or slaughter so long as the heir otherwise complies with this 
part.
    (2) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the commodity if the producer retains control, 
title, and risk of loss in the commodity, including the right to make 
all decisions regarding the tender of such commodity to CCC for 
marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments, including those 
cases where the producer takes either of the actions in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section as follows:
    (i) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, for such commodity 
if all other eligibility requirements are met and the option to purchase 
contains the following:

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title; risk of loss; and beneficial interest in the commodity, as 
specified in 7 CFR 1421.6, shall remain with the producer until the 
buyer exercises this

[[Page 400]]

option to purchase the commodity. This option to purchase shall expire, 
notwithstanding any action or inaction by either the producer or the 
buyer, at the earlier of:
    (1) The maturity of any Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loan that 
is secured by such commodity;
    (2) The date CCC claims title to such commodity; or
    (3) Such other date as provided in this option;

    (ii) Enters into a contract to sell the commodity if the producer 
retains title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the commodity 
and the purchaser pays no advance payment amount or any incentive 
payment amount to enter into such contract to the producer, except as 
provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (3) If marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments are 
made available to producers through an approved CMA under part 1425 of 
this chapter, the beneficial interest in the commodity must always have 
been in the producer-member who delivered the commodity to the CMA or 
its member CMA's, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Commodities delivered to such a CMA shall not be eligible to receive 
marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments if the producer-
member who delivered the commodity does not retain the right to share in 
the proceeds from the marketing of the commodity as provided in part 
1425 of this chapter.
    (b) With respect to wool, mohair, dry peas, lentils and small 
chickpeas produced in the 2002 crop year, producers who lost beneficial 
interest before October 11, 2002 are eligible for a loan deficiency 
payment based on the date the producer lost beneficial interest in the 
applicable commodity.

a nonrecourse marketing assistance loan at a rate that is the lesser of:
    (i) The marketing assistance loan rate and charges, plus interest 
determined for such crop; or
    (ii) The alternative repayment rate for such crop.
    (2) To the extent practicable, CCC shall determine and announce the

U.S. markets as determined by CCC, to minimize loan forfeitures, 
minimize the Federal Government-owned inventory of the commodities, 
minimize the storage costs incurred by the Federal Government 
domestically and internationally, and minimize discrepancies in 
marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and across county 
boundaries. The alternative repayment rate may be adjusted to reflect 
quality and location for each crop of a commodity as follows:
    (i) On a weekly basis in each county for oilseeds, except soybeans;
    (ii) On a daily basis in each county for barley, corn, grain 
sorghum, oats, soybeans, and wheat; and

    (ii) The alternative repayment rate for such crop.
    (2) To the extent practicable, CCC shall determine and announce 
periodically an alternative repayment rate for peanuts, wool, and mohair 
to minimize loan forfeitures, minimize the Federal Government-owned 
inventory of the commodities, minimize the storage costs incurred by the 
Federal Government domestically and internationally, and minimize 
discrepancies in marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and 
across county boundaries.
    (c)(1) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice shall 
be determined by CCC based upon a review of prices at which rice is 
being sold in world markets and a weighting of such prices through the 
use of information such as changes in supply and demand of rice, tender 
offers, credit concessions, barter sales, government-to-government 
sales, special processing costs for coatings or premixes, and other 
relevant price indicators, and shall be expressed in U.S. equivalent 
values F.O.B. vessel, U.S. port of export, per hundredweight as follows:
    (i) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, long grain milled 
rice;
    (ii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, medium grain milled 
rice; and
    (iii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, short grain milled 
rice.
    (2) Export transactions involving rice and all other related market 
information will be monitored on a continuous basis. Relevant 
information may be obtained for this purpose from USDA field reports, 
international organizations, public or private research entities, 
international rice brokers, and other sources of reliable information.
    (3) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice adjusted 
to U.S. quality and location the adjusted world price (AWP), as 
determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, shall apply to this 
section.
    (4) The adjusted world price for each class of rice shall equal the 
prevailing world market price for a class of rice (U.S. equivalent 
value) as determined under paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section and 
adjusted to U.S. quality and location as follows:
    (i) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice shall be 
adjusted to reflect an F.O.B. mill position by deducting from such 
calculated price an amount that is equal to the estimated national 
average costs associated with:
    (A) The use of bags for the export of U.S. rice, and
    (B) The transfer of such rice from a mill location to F.O.B. vessel 
at the U.S. port of export with such costs including, but not limited 
to, freight, unloading, wharfage, insurance, inspection, fumigation, 
stevedoring, interest, banking charges, storage, and administrative 
costs.
    (ii) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section 
shall be adjusted to reflect the market value of the total quantity of 
whole kernels contained in milled rice by deducting the world value of 
broken kernels it

[[Page 403]]

contains, with the value of the broken kernels determined by multiplying 
the quantity of broken kernels (4 percent per hundredweight) by the 
world market value of broken kernels. The world market value of broken 
kernels shall be based upon the relationship of whole and broken kernel 
world prices as estimated from observations of prices at which rice is 
being sold in world markets.
    (iii) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section shall be adjusted to reflect the per-pound market value of whole 
kernels by dividing the price by the quantity of whole milled kernels 
contained in the milled rice (96 percent per hundredweight).
    (iv) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section shall be adjusted to reflect the market value of whole kernels 
contained in 100 pounds of rough rice by multiplying such price by the 
estimated national average quantity of whole kernel rice by class 
obtained from milling 100 pounds of rough rice.
    (v) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section 
shall be adjusted to reflect the total market value of rough rice by:
    (A) Adding to such price:
    (1) The market value of bran contained in the rough rice, computed 
by multiplying the domestic unit market value of bran by the estimated 
national average quantity of bran produced in milling 100 pounds of 
rice; and
    (2) The market value of broken kernels contained in the rough rice, 
computed by multiplying the estimated world market value of broken 
kernels by the estimated national average quantity of broken kernels 
produced in milling 100 pounds of rice;
    (B) Deducting from such price:
    (1) An estimated cost of milling rough rice; and
    (2) An estimated cost of transporting rough rice from farm to mill 
locations.
    (vi) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section 
may be adjusted to a whole kernel loan rate basis by deducting the 
estimated world market value of the total quantity of broken kernels 
contained in such rice and dividing the resulting value by the estimated 
national average quantity of milled whole kernels produced in milling 
100 pounds of rice.
    (5)(i) The adjusted world price for each class for rice, loan rate 
basis, shall be determined by CCC and announced, to the extent 
practicable, on or after 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time each Tuesday, 
or more frequently, as determined necessary by CCC, continuing through 
the later of:
    (A) The last Tuesday of July 2007; or
    (B) The last Tuesday of the latest month the 2007-crop rice loans 
mature.
    (ii) In the event that Tuesday is a non-workday, the determination 
will be made on the next workday, on or after 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard 
time.
    (iii) The announced prices will be effective upon announcement and 
will remain in effect for a period as announced by the CCC.
    (6) On the day of the announcement of the adjusted world price, 
applications for loan deficiency payments for rice that specify the 
payment rate will not be accepted between 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard 
time and the time of the world price announcement.

    (1) Certify the quantity of such commodity on the loan application, 
or;
    (2) Have such quantity measured by CCC at the measurement service 
rate established by CCC.
    (b) The State committee may establish a marketing assistance loan 
percentage not to exceed a percentage CCC establishes or it may apply 
quality discounts to the loan rate in each year for each commodity on a 
Statewide basis or for specified areas within the State. Before 
approving a county committee request to establish a different loan 
percentage, or to apply quality discounts, the State committee shall 
consider conditions in the State or areas within a State to determine if 
the marketing assistance loan percentage should be reduced below the 
maximum marketing assistance loan percentage or the quality discounts 
should be applied to the basic county marketing assistance loan rate to 
provide CCC with adequate protection. Marketing assistance loans 
disbursed based upon loan percentages previously lowered and loan rates 
adjusted for quality shall not be altered if conditions within the State 
or areas within the State change to substantiate removing such 
reductions. Percentages established or loan rates adjusted for quality 
under this section shall apply only to new marketing assistance loans 
and not to outstanding marketing assistance loans. In determining loan 
percentages or the necessity to apply quality discounts, the State 
committee shall consider any factor at its discretion, including the 
following:

    (2) Factors affecting quality peculiar to an area within the State; 
and
    (3) Climatic conditions affecting storability.
    (c) An eligible quantity of a commodity that is commingled with an 
ineligible quantity of the commodity is not eligible to be collateral 
for a marketing assistance loan unless the producer, when requesting a 
marketing assistance loan designates all structures that may be used for 
storage of the marketing assistance loan collateral.
    (1) In such cases, the producer is not required to obtain prior 
written approval from the county committee before moving marketing 
assistance loan collateral from one designated structure to another 
designated structure.
    (2) In all other instances, if the producer intends to move 
marketing assistance loan collateral from a designated structure to 
another undesignated structure, the producer must request prior approval 
from the county committee. Such approval shall be written and the 
eligible or ineligible commodity must be measured by a representative of 
the county office, at the producer's expense, before commingling. Prior 
to commingling, with respect to wool and mohair, a representative of the 
county committee may determine an average production of the wool and 
mohair in a manner approved by CCC.
    (d)(1) Two or more producers may obtain:
    (i) A single joint marketing assistance loan for commodities that 
are stored in the same farm storage facility; or
    (ii) Individual marketing assistance loans for their share of the 
commodity that is commingled in a farm storage facility with commodities 
owned by other producers if such other producers execute an agreement 
that provides that such producers shall obtain the permission of a 
representative of the county committee before removal of any quantity of 
the commodity from the storage facility. All producers who store a 
commodity in a farm storage facility in which commodities that have been 
pledged as collateral for a marketing assistance loan shall be liable 
for any damage incurred by CCC for the deterioration or unauthorized 
removal or disposition of such commodities.
    (2) In such cases, each producer must execute a note and security 
agreement with CCC, and each such producer shall be jointly and 
severally liable for the violation of the terms and conditions of the 
note and the requirements of this part. Each producer is also liable for 
repayment of the entire marketing

[[Page 407]]

assistance loan amount until the marketing assistance loan is fully 
repaid without regard to their share in the commodity pledged as 
collateral. In addition, such producer may not amend the note and 
security agreement for the producer's claimed share in such commodities, 
or marketing assistance loan proceeds, after execution of the note and 
security agreement by CCC.
    (e)(1) A producer, when requesting a marketing assistance loan, 
shall designate in writing specific storage structures.
    (2) The producer is not required to request prior approval before 
moving marketing assistance loan collateral between such designated 
structures.
    (3) Movement of marketing assistance loan collateral to any other 
structures not designated or the disposal of such loan collateral 
without prior written approval of the county committee, shall subject 
the producer to administrative actions.
    (4) The producer is responsible for any loss in quantity or quality 
of the farm-stored commodity pledged as collateral.
    (5) CCC shall not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the 
marketing assistance loan collateral for farm-stored loans.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.106  Warehouse-stored marketing assistance loan collateral.

    (a) A commodity may be pledged as collateral for a warehouse-stored 
marketing assistance loan in the quantity delivered to CCC for storage 
at a warehouse that meets standards for approval at part 1423 of this 
chapter. Such quantity shall be the net weight specified on the 
warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate.
    (b) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint marketing 
assistance loan for commodities stored in an approved warehouse if the 
warehouse receipt pledged as collateral is issued jointly to the 
producers.
    (c) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
with CCC, each such producer shall be jointly and severally liable for 
the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and the 
regulations in this part. Each such producer shall also remain liable 
for repayment of the entire marketing assistance loan amount until the 
marketing assistance loan is fully repaid without regard to such 
producer's claimed share in the commodity pledged as collateral for the 
marketing assistance loan. In addition, such producer may not amend the 
note and security agreement with respect to the producer's claimed share 
in such commodities, or marketing assistance loan proceeds, after 
execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.
    (d) Handling and storage rates that CCC has approved to be deducted 
from marketing assistance loan proceeds are available in USDA State and 
county FSA service centers. Deductions shall be based upon entries on 
the warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate, but the storage rate 
shall not exceed the storage rate CCC has approved. No storage deduction 
shall be made if written evidence acceptable to CCC is submitted 
indicating that:
    (1) Storage charges through the maturity date have been prepaid; or
    (2) The producer has arranged with the warehouse operator for the 
payment of storage charges through the maturity date and the warehouse 
operator enters an endorsement in substantially the following form on 
the warehouse receipt:

    Storage arrangements have been made by the depositor of the 
commodity covered by this receipt through (date through which storage 
has been provided). No lien will be asserted by the warehouse operator 
against CCC or any subsequent holder of the warehouse receipt for the 
storage charges that accrued before the specified date.

    (e) The beginning date to be used for computing storage deductions 
on the commodity stored in an approved warehouse shall be the later of 
the following:
    (1) The date the commodity was received or deposited in the 
warehouse;
    (2) The date the storage charges start; or
    (3) The day following the date through which storage charges have 
been paid.
    (f) For hard red winter and hard red spring wheat tendered to CCC 
and stored in an approved warehouse, producers must obtain official 
protein content determinations or, as CCC determines is acceptable,

may be determined by mutual agreement between the producer and the 
warehouse operator. Costs of determinations shall not be paid by CCC.
    (g) For warehouse-stored peanuts, CCC will pay storage charges and 
in-charges and other fees as determined by CCC, to ensure proper storage 
of CCC loan collateral. The beginning date to be used for computing 
storage deductions on the CCC peanut loan collateral stored in an 
approved warehouse shall be the later of the following:
    (1) The date the commodity was received or deposited in the 
warehouse;
    (2) The date the storage charges start; or
    (3) The day following the date through which storage charges have 
been paid.

Sec. 1421.107  Warehouse receipts.

    (a) Warehouse receipts tendered to CCC under Sec. 1421.3 for 
marketing assistance loans must meet the provisions of this section and 
all other provisions of this part, and CCC program documents.
    (b) Warehouse receipts must be issued in the name of the eligible 
producer or CCC. If issued in the name of the eligible producer, the 
receipt must be properly endorsed on its reverse side certifying that 
the crop is free of encumbrances in order for title to vest in the 
holder. Receipts must be issued by an approved warehouse and must 
represent a commodity that is deemed to be stored commingled. The 
receipts must be negotiable and must represent a commodity that is the 
same quantity and quality as the eligible commodity actually in storage 
in the warehouse of the original deposit.
    (c) If the receipt is issued for a commodity that is owned by the 
warehouse operator either solely, jointly, or in common with others, the 
fact of such ownership shall be stated on the receipt. In States where 
the pledge of warehouse receipts issued by a warehouse operator on the 
warehouse operator's commodity is invalid, the warehouse operator may 
offer the commodity to CCC for a marketing assistance loan if such 
warehouse is licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.
    (d) Each warehouse receipt or accompanying supplemental certificate 
representing a commodity stored in an approved warehouse that has a 
storage agreement with CCC shall indicate that the commodity is insured 
under such agreement. CCC shall not be responsible for the cost of such 
insurance.
    (e) A separate warehouse receipt must be submitted for each grade 
and class of any commodity tendered to CCC and, for rice, such receipt 
must also state the milling yield of the rice, and for wool, such 
receipts must also state the yield and micron of the wool.
    (f) With respect to peanuts, a warehouse receipt must be submitted 
exhibiting grade, type, and segregation for peanuts tendered to CCC.
    (g)(1) Each warehouse receipt, or a supplemental certificate (in 
duplicate) that properly identifies the warehouse receipt, must be 
issued under the applicable CCC storage agreement or the U.S. Warehouse 
Act, as applicable, and must indicate:
    (i) The name and location of the storing warehouse;
    (ii) The warehouse code assigned by CCC;
    (iii) The warehouse receipt number;
    (iv) The date the receipt was issued;
    (v) The type of commodity;
    (vi) The date the commodity was deposited or received;
    (vii) The date to which storage has been paid or the storage start 
date;
    (viii) Whether the commodity was received by rail, truck or barge;
    (ix) The amount per bushel, pound, or hundredweight of prepaid in or 
out charges;
    (x) The signature of the warehouse operator or the authorized agent; 
and
    (xi) For warehouses operating under a merged warehouse code 
agreement (KC-385), the location and county to which the producer 
delivered the commodity.
    (2) In addition to the information specified in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, additional commodity specific requirements shall be 
determined by CCC and be available at State and county offices and the 
Kansas City Commodity Office.

[[Page 409]]

    (h) If a warehouse receipt indicates that the commodity tendered for 
loan grades ``infested'' or ``contains excess moisture'', or both, the 
receipt must be accompanied by a supplemental certificate in order for 
the commodity to be eligible for a marketing assistance loan. The grade, 
grading factors, and quantity to be delivered must be shown on the 
certificate as follows:
    (1) When the warehouse receipt shows ``infested'' and the commodity 
has been conditioned to correct the infested condition, the supplemental 
certificate must show the same grade without the ``infested'' 
designation and the same grading factors and quantity as shown on the 
warehouse receipt.
    (2)(i) When the warehouse receipt shows that the commodity contained 
excess moisture and the commodity has been dried or blended, the 
supplemental certificate must show the grade, grading factors, and 
quantity after drying or blending of the commodity. Such entries shall 
reflect a drying or blending shrinkage as provided in paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (ii) When a supplemental certificate is issued under paragraphs 
(g)(1) and (g)(2)(i) of this section, the grade, grading factors and the 
quantity shown on such certificate shall supersede the entries for such 
items on the warehouse receipt.
    (iii) If the commodity has been dried or blended to reduce the 
moisture content, the quantity specified on the warehouse receipt or the 
supplemental certificate shall represent the quantity after drying or 
blending.
    (iv) For commodities dried or blended under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of 
this section, such quantity shall reflect a minimum shrinkage in the 
receiving weight excluding dockage:
    (A) For the following commodities, 1.3 times the percentage 
difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and 
the following percentages for the specified commodity:
    (1) Barley: 14.5 percent;
    (2) Corn: 15.5 percent;
    (3) Grain sorghum: 14.0 percent;
    (4) Oats: 14.0 percent;
    (5) Rice: 14.0 percent;
    (6) Soybeans: 14.0 percent;
    (7) Wheat: 13.5 percen; and
    (8) Peanuts: 10.0 percent.
    (B) For the following commodities, 1.1 times the percentage 
difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and 
the following percentages for the specified commodity:
    (1) Canola: 10.0 percent;
    (2) Flaxseed: 9.0 percent;
    (3) Mustard Seed: 10.0 percent;
    (4) Rapeseed: 10.0 percent;
    (5) Safflower Seed: 10.0 percent;
    (6) Sunflower Seed: 10.0 percent;
    (7) Crambe: 10.0 percent; and
    (8) Sesame Seed: 10.0 percent.
    (i)(1) If, under paragraph (g) of this section, a supplemental 
certificate is issued in connection with a warehouse receipt, such 
certificate must state that no lien for processing will be asserted by 
the warehouse operator against CCC or any subsequent holder of such 
receipt.
    (2) Warehouse receipts and the commodities represented by such 
receipts that are stored in an approved warehouse that is operating 
under a CCC storage agreement may be subject to a lien for warehouse 
charges as specified in the applicable storage agreement. For all 
commodities except peanuts, the producer who pledged such a receipt as 
collateral for a loan under this part shall pay to CCC all costs 
incurred by CCC as result of the existence of the lien. In no event 
shall a warehouse operator be entitled to satisfy such a lien by sale of 
the commodities when CCC is the holder of such receipt.
    (j) Warehouse receipts representing commodities that have been 
shipped by rail or by barge, must be accompanied by supplemental 
certificates completed under paragraph (f) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.108  Transfers and reconcentrations.

    (a) Upon request by the producer before transfer, the county 
committee may approve the transfer of a quantity of a commodity that is 
pledged as collateral for a farm-stored loan to a warehouse-stored loan 
at any time during the loan period.
    (1) Liquidation of the farm-stored loan or part thereof shall be 
made through the pledge of warehouse receipts for the commodity placed 
under warehouse-stored loan and the immediate payment by the producer of 
the

[[Page 410]]

amount by which the warehouse-stored loan is less than the farm-stored 
loan or part thereof and charges plus interest. The loan quantity for 
the warehouse-stored loan cannot exceed 110 percent of the loan quantity 
transferred from the farm-stored loan.
    (2) Any amounts due the producer shall be disbursed by the FSA 
county service center.
    (b) Upon request by the producer before the transfer, the county 
committee may approve the transfer of a warehouse-stored loan or part 
thereof to a farm-stored loan at any time during the marketing 
assistance loan period. Quantities pledged as collateral for a farm-
stored loan shall be based on a measurement or a calculation of average 
production of wool and mohair, such measurement or calculation to be 
made by a representative of the county office before approving the farm-
stored loan. The producer must immediately repay the amount by which the 
farm-stored loan is less than the warehouse-stored loan and charges plus 
interest on the shortage. The maturity date of the farm-stored loan 
shall be the maturity date applicable to the warehouse-stored loan that 
was transferred.
    (c) Upon the filing of the Reconcentration Agreement and Trust 
Receipt by the producer and warehouse operator, CCC may, during the 
marketing assistance loan period, approve the reconcentration in another 
CCC-approved warehouse for all or part of a commodity that is pledged as 
collateral for a warehouse-stored loan. Any such approval shall be 
subject to the terms and conditions in the Reconcentration Agreement and 
Trust Receipt. A producer may, before the new warehouse receipt is 
delivered to CCC, pay to CCC:
    (1) The principal amount of the marketing assistance loan and 
charges plus interest and applicable charges; or
    (2) If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount of 
the marketing assistance loan and charges plus interest under the terms 
and conditions specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the 
commodity pledged as collateral for such marketing assistance loan.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.109  Personal liability of the producer.

    (a) When a producer obtains a commodity marketing assistance loan, 
the producer agrees, in writing, not to:
    (1) Provide an incorrect certification of the quantity or make any 
fraudulent or erroneous representation for the marketing assistance 
loan; or
    (2) Remove or dispose of a quantity of commodity that is collateral 
for a CCC farm-stored loan without prior written approval from CCC.
    (3) The violation of the terms and conditions of the note and 
security agreement, will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may 
be disbursed to the producer for a quantity of a commodity that is not 
actually in existence or for a quantity on which the producer is not 
eligible.
    (b) Such violations as are referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section may include:
    (1) Incorrect certification;
    (2) Unauthorized removal; and
    (3) Unauthorized disposition.
    (c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for such violations. 
Accordingly, if the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed such violations, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the 
quantity of the commodity that is involved in the violation.
    (d) In the case of violations, if CCC determines the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the marketing assistance loan rate applicable to 
the loan note for the first offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the marketing assistance loan rate applicable to 
the loan note for the second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the marketing assistance loan rate applicable to the loan 
note.

[[Page 411]]

    (e) For violations and the liquidated damages under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the marketing assistance loan quantity 
incorrectly certified or the loan quantity removed or disposed at the 
lesser of:
    (i) The applicable loan principal, and charges, plus interest or;
    (ii) The announced alternative repayment rate in effect on date the 
violation occurred, plus 15 percent of the loan rate, as otherwise 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, and
    (2) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 days from the 
date of notification, accelerate the marketing assistance loan in 
default and require repayment of all loan principal, charges, and 
interest.
    (f) For violations committed and the liquidated damages were 
assessed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the county committee 
shall call the loan involved in the violation, and require repayment of 
the entire loan principal, charges and interest.
    (g) The county committee may waive the liquidated damages if it 
determines that the violation was inadvertent, accidental, and 
unintentional.
    (h) If, for any violation, the county committee determines that 
CCC's interest is not or will not be protected, the county committee 
shall call all of the producer's farm-stored loans, and deny future 
farm-stored loans and loan deficiency payments without production 
evidence for 24 months after the date the violation is discovered. 
Depending on the severity of the violation, the county committee may 
deny future farm-stored loans and loan deficiency payments without 
production evidence for an additional period CCC designates.
    (i) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation, the county committee shall notify the producer in 
writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken.
    (j) If the loan is accelerated, the producer may not repay the loan 
at the lower alternative loan repayment rate and may not utilize 
commodity certificate exchanges, unless authorized by CCC.
    (k) Producers rejected for a farm-stored loan under this section may 
apply for a warehouse-stored loan.
    (l) The loan plus other charges shall be payable to CCC upon demand 
if a producer:
    (1) Makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a marketing 
assistance loan, maintaining, or settling a loan; or
    (2) Disposes or moves the loan collateral without the approval of 
CCC.
    (m) A producer shall be personally liable for damages resulting from 
a commodity delivered to or removed by CCC containing mercurial 
compounds, toxin producing molds, or other substances poisonous or 
harmful to humans or animals or property.
    (n) If the amount disbursed under a marketing assistance loan or in 
settlement thereof, exceeds the amount authorized by this part, the 
producer shall be liable for repayment of such excess and charges, plus 
interest.
    (o) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
marketing assistance loan is less than the amount required under this 
part, the producer shall be personally liable for repayment of the 
amount of such deficiency and charges, plus interest.
    (p) In the case of joint loans or loan deficiency payments, the 
personal liability for the amounts specified in this section shall be 
joint and several on the part of each producer signing the note or loan 
deficiency payment application.
    (q) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed may be waived as 
determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.110  Repayments.

    (a) CCC may allow a producer to repay a nonrecourse marketing 
assistance loan at a rate that is the lesser of:
    (1) The loan rate and charges, plus interest determined for a crop; 
or
    (2) The prevailing world market price, as determined by CCC, for 
rice or the alternative repayment rate for all

[[Page 412]]

other commodities, as determined by CCC.
    (b)(1) On a form prescribed by CCC, a producer may request to lock 
in the applicable repayment rate for a period of:
    (i) 60 calendar days; or
    (ii) not less than 14 calendar days before the maturity date of the 
loan, but not both.
    (2) The request to lock in the applicable repayment rate must be 
received in the FSA county service center that disbursed the loan.
    (3) The repayment rate that is locked in is the rate in effect when 
the request to lock in is approved.
    (4) The repayment rate may be locked in on outstanding farm-stored 
or warehouse-stored loans.
    (5) The repayment rate that is locked in will expire the earlier of:
    (i) 60 calendar days from date of approval, or;
    (ii) 14 calendar days before loan maturity.
    (6) The requests can only be completed one time for a designated 
quantity.
    (7) The requests can be made in person or by facsimile.
    (8) The requests cannot be canceled, terminated, or changed after 
approval.
    (9) The locked-in applicable repayment rate will not transfer to any 
loan disbursed outside of the originating county where the commodity was 
stored.
    (10) Once a repayment rate is locked in it cannot be extended.
    (c) If a producer fails to repay a marketing assistance loan within 
the time prescribed by CCC under the terms and conditions of the request 
to lock in a market loan repayment rate, the producer may repay the 
loan:
    (1) On or before maturity, at the lesser of:
    (i) Principal plus interest as determined by CCC;
    (ii) The repayment rate in effect on the day the repayment is 
received in the FSA county service center.
    (2) After maturity at principal plus interest.
    (d) When the proceeds of the sale of the commodity are needed to 
repay all or a part of a farm-stored loan, the producer must request and 
obtain prior written approval on a CCC approved form and comply with the 
terms and conditions of such form, to remove a specified quantity of the 
commodity from storage. Approval does not constitute release of CCC's 
security interest in the commodity or release of producer liability for 
amounts due CCC for the marketing assistance loan indebtedness if 
payment in full is not received by the county office. Failure to repay a 
marketing assistance loan within the time period prescribed by CCC in 
the case of a farm-stored loan and delivery of the pledged collateral to 
a buyer, is a violation of the agreement. In the case of such violation, 
the producer must repay the loan principal and interest or another 
amount as determined by the Deputy Administrator, FSA, under 
Sec. 1421.109.
    (e) The producer may obtain county committee approval of a release 
of all or part of pledged collateral for a warehouse-stored loan at or 
before the maturity of such loan by paying to CCC:
    (1) The principal amount of the marketing assistance loan and 
charges plus interest, or
    (2) An amount less than the principal amount of the marketing 
assistance loan and charges plus interest under the terms and conditions 
specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the collateral for 
such loan.
    (f) A partial release of marketing assistance loan collateral must 
cover all of the commodity represented by one warehouse receipt. 
Warehouse receipts redeemed by repayment of the marketing assistance 
loan shall be released only to the producer. However, such receipt may 
be released to persons designated in a written authorization that is 
filed with the county office by the producer within 15 days before the 
date of repayment.
    (g) The note and security agreement shall not be released until the 
marketing assistance loan has been satisfied in full.
    (h)(1) If the commodity is moved from storage without obtaining 
prior approval to move such commodity, such removal shall constitute 
unauthorized removal or disposition, as applicable under 
Sec. 1421.109(b), unless the removal occurred on a non-workday and the 
producer notified the county

[[Page 413]]

office on the next workday of such removal.
    (2) Any loan quantities involved in a violation of Sec. 1421.109 
must be repaid under Sec. 1421.109(e).


<R05>
Sec. 1421.111  Commodity certificate exchanges.

    (a) For any outstanding marketing assistance loan, a producer may 
purchase a commodity certificate and exchange that commodity certificate 
for the marketing assistance loan collateral.
    (b) The exchange rate is the lessor of:
    (1) The loan rate and charges, plus interest applicable to the loan;
    (2) The prevailing world market price, as determined by CCC, for 
rice or the alternative repayment rate for all other commodities, as 
determined by CCC.
    (c) Commodity certificate exchanges may not be used when locking in 
a repayment rate under Sec. 1421.110.
    (d) Producers must request a commodity certificate exchange in 
person at the FSA county service center that disbursed the marketing 
assistance loan by:
    (1) Completing a written request as CCC determines.
    (2) Purchasing a commodity certificate for the exact amount required 
to exchange the marketing assistance loan collateral.
    (3) Immediately exchanging the purchased commodity certificate for 
the outstanding loan collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.112  Loan settlement.

    (a) The value of the settlement of marketing assistance loan shall 
be made by CCC on the following basis:
    (1) For nonrecourse marketing assistance loans, the schedule of 
premiums and discounts for the commodity provided that:
    (i) If, the value of the collateral at settlement is less than the 
amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency 
and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or
    (ii) If, the value of the collateral at settlement is greater than 
the amount due, such excess shall be retained by CCC and CCC shall have 
no obligation to pay such amount to any party.
    (2) For recourse marketing assistance loans, the proceeds from the 
sale of the commodity provided that:
    (i) If, the value of the collateral at settlement is less than the 
amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency 
and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or
    (ii) If, the proceeds received from the sale of the commodity are 
greater than the sum of the amount due, plus any cost incurred by CCC in 
conducting the sale of the commodity, the amount of such excess shall be 
paid to the producer or, if applicable, to a secured creditor of the 
producer.
    (3) If CCC sells the commodity described in paragraphs (a)(1) or 
(a)(2) of this section in settlement of the marketing assistance loan, 
the sales proceeds shall be applied to the amount owed CCC by the 
producer. The producer shall be responsible for any costs incurred by 
CCC in completing the sale. CCC may deduct such amount from the sales 
proceeds.
    (b) Settlements made by CCC for eligible commodities that are 
acquired by CCC and that are stored in an approved warehouse shall be 
made on the basis of the entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, 
supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents.
    (c) Settlements made by CCC for peanuts acquired by CCC and stored 
in an approved warehouse shall be based on the settlement value at the 
time of the loan disbursement and the entries in the applicable 
warehouse receipt, supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents 
subject to adjustments for changes in quality and other factors.
    (1) All eligible commodities that are stored in other than approved 
warehouses shall be delivered to CCC as CCC instructs. Settlement shall 
be based on entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, supplemental 
certificate, and accompanying documents.
    (2) For eligible loan commodities that are delivered from other than 
an approved warehouse, settlement shall be made by CCC on the basis of 
the basic marketing assistance loan rate that is in effect for the 
commodity at the producer's customary delivery point, as determined by 
CCC.

[[Page 414]]

    (d) In all cases, settlements may be adjusted for changes in quality 
and other factors affecting the value of the commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.113  Foreclosure.

    (a)(1) Upon maturity and nonpayment of a warehouse-stored loan, 
title to the unredeemed collateral securing the marketing assistance 
loan shall immediately vest in CCC.
    (2) Upon maturity and nonpayment of a farm-stored marketing 
assistance loan, title to the unredeemed collateral shall automatically 
transfer to CCC upon CCC demand.
    (3) When CCC acquires title to the unredeemed collateral, CCC shall 
not pay for any market value that such collateral may have in excess of 
the marketing assistance loan indebtedness, (the unpaid amount of the 
note and charges plus interest).
    (b) If the total amount due on a farm-stored loan (the unpaid amount 
of the note plus charges, and interest) is not satisfied upon maturity, 
CCC may remove the commodity from storage, and assign, transfer, and 
deliver the commodity or documents evidencing title thereto when, how, 
and upon terms as CCC determines. Disposition may also be effected 
without removing the commodity from storage. The commodity may be 
processed before sale and CCC may become the purchaser of the whole or 
any part of the commodity at either a public or private sale.
    (1) The value of settlement for a farm-stored commodity removed by 
CCC from storage and shall be as provided in Sec. 1421.112.
    (2) If a deficiency exists after the collateral is sold, a claim for 
such deficiency will be established in accordance with part 1403 of this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.115  Recourse marketing assistance loans.

    (a) CCC shall make recourse marketing assistance loans available to

    (a) The loan deficiency payment rate for a crop shall be the amount 
by which the loan rate for the crop exceeds the rate at which CCC has 
announced that producers may repay their loans under Sec. 1421.10.
    (b) Such rate shall be the amount determined:
    (1) For loan deficiency payments other than field direct:
    (i) On the day the producer submits a completed request for a loan 
deficiency payment to the FSA county service center;
    (ii) Using the rate in effect for the FSA county service center

which the loan deficiency payment is requested.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.202  Loan deficiency payment quantity.

    (a) A loan deficiency payment may be based on 100 percent of the net

incorrect certification of such commodities under Sec. 1421.203.
    (c) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint loan deficiency 
payment for commodities that are stored in an approved or unapproved 
warehouse if the acceptable documentation representing an eligible 
commodity for which a loan deficiency payment is requested is completed 
jointly for such producers.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.203  Personal liability of the producer.

    (a) When a producer requests a loan deficiency payment, the producer 
agrees:
    (1) When signing the Loan Deficiency Payment Application and 
Certification or the Direct Loan Deficiency Payment Agreement, as 
applicable, that the producer will not provide an incorrect 
certification of the quantity or make any fraudulent representation for 
loan deficiency payment purpose; and
    (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of the loan 
deficiency payment request, as applicable, will cause harm or damage to 
CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the producer for a quantity of a 
commodity that is not actually in existence or for a quantity on which 
the producer is not eligible, if CCC determines that the producer has 
violated the terms and conditions of the applicable forms prescribed by 
CCC, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of the 
commodity that is involved in the violation.
    (b) If CCC determines that the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan deficiency payment rate for the first 
offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan deficiency payment rate for the second 
offense.
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than

[[Page 416]]

the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be assessed by 
multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 percent of the 
loan deficiency payment rate.
    (c) For violations to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
applies, the producer must repay the loan deficiency payment applicable 
to the loan deficiency quantity incorrectly certified, and charges, plus 
interest applicable to the amount repaid. If the producer fails to pay 
such amounts within 30 days from the date of notification, the producer 
must repay the entire loan deficiency payment and charges plus interest.
    (d) For violations to which paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
applies, the producer shall repay of the entire loan deficiency payment 
and charges plus interest.
    (e) CCC may waive the liquidated damages taken applicable to 
paragraph (b) of this section if the CCC determines that the violation 
occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or unintentionally.
    (f) If, for any violation to which paragraph (b) of this section 
applies, the county committee determines that CCC's interest is not or 
will not be protected, the county committee shall:
    (1) Call the producer's farm-stored loans;
    (2) Deny future farm-stored loans for the current and 2 following 
crop years;
    (3) Deny loan deficiency payments for the current and 2 following 
crop years unless production evidence is presented to CCC. Depending on 
the severity of the violation, the county committee may deny future 
farm-stored loan and loan deficiency payments without production 
evidence.
    (g) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation, the county committee shall notify the producer in 
writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative action will be taken under this section.
    (h) If the amount disbursed under loan deficiency payments exceeds 
the amount authorized by this part, the producer shall be liable for 
repayment of such excess and charges, plus interest.
    (i) In the case of joint loan deficiency payments, the personal 
liability for the amounts specified in this section shall be joint and 
several on the part of each producer signing the loan deficiency payment 
application.
    (j) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section may be waived as determined 
by CCC.

Sec. 1421.301  Administration.

    (a) This subpart shall be administered by the Farm Service Agency 
(FSA) under the general direction and supervision of the Executive Vice 
President, CCC or designee. The program shall be carried out in the 
field by State and county FSA employees under the general direction and 
supervision of the State and county FSA committees.
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and employees

which has not been taken by the county committee. The State committee 
shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action 
taken by such county committee which is not in accordance with the 
regulations of this part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action which 
is not in accordance with the regulations of this part.
    (d) No delegation herein to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, from 
determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or 
modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (DAFP), FSA, may 
authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines and 
other program requirements in cases where timeliness or failure to meet 
such other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the 
program. In addition, DAFP may establish other conditions for payments 
that will assist in achieving the goals of the program and may include 
such provisions in the program agreement or other program documents.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.302  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section shall be applicable for 
all purposes of program administration under this subpart:
    COC means the FSA county office committee.
    CCC means the Commodity Credit Corporation.
    Department means the United States Department of Agriculture.
    Deputy Administrator means the Deputy Administrator for Farm 
Programs, Farm Service Agency (FSA) or a designee of that person.
    FSA means the Farm Service Agency of the Department.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, or the Secretary's delegate.
    STC means the FSA State committee.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.303  Eligible producer and eligible land.

    (a) To be an eligible producer for a payment under this subpart, the 
person must be a producer of wheat, barley, oats, or triticale in the 
2002 through 2007 crop years. Also, to be an eligible producer, the 
person must meet all other qualifications for payment that are set out 
in this subpart, set out in parts 12, 718, 1400, and 1405 of this title. 
A person will not be considered the producer of the crop unless that 
person was responsible for the planting of the crop and had the risk of 
loss in the crop at all times, including, at the time of planting and 
the time of the request for a payment under, this subpart.
    (b) A minor may participate in the program if the right of majority 
has been conferred on the minor by court order or by statute, or if the 
minor participates through a guardian authorized to act on the minor's 
behalf in these matters. Alternatively, a minor may participate if the 
program documents are all signed by an acceptable (to CCC) guarantor or 
if bond, acceptable to CCC, is provided by a surety.
    (c) For the crop to be eligible, the crop, in addition to other 
standards that may apply, must be grown on land that is classified as 
``cropland'' in FSA farm records or on land that FSA determines has been 
cropped in the last 3 years except that the land may also qualify if the 
land is committed to a crop rotation, normal for the locality, that 
includes harvesting the subject crop for grain. These rules are designed 
to assure, to the extent practicable, the available payment did not 
produce plantings that otherwise would not have occurred and the CCC may 
deny payments in any instance in which there is reason to believe that 
the planting was done for that purpose. To that end, if the commodity 
involved has not been previously grown by the producer or is not one 
which is not predominately produced locally, the producer must submit 
evidence of seed purchases for planting the commodities and other 
evidence deemed needed or appropriate by the COC in order to assure that 
the program goals are made and that the land was not planted to an 
eligible commodity simply to

[[Page 418]]

obtain a payment. Also, the land to be eligible must, for the year 
involved, be grazed and cannot, during the crop year, be harvested at 
any time for any purpose, except as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator to accommodate producers with a history of double-cropping 
when the crop to be harvested is not the crop for which a payment is to 
be made under this subpart. Land will be considered grazed only to the 
extent that the crop on the land is consumed in the field as live plants 
by livestock for the normal period of time for grazing in the area.
    (d)(1) A producer must, at the time of the agreement made under this 
part to obtain a payment, meet all other eligible criteria for obtaining 
loan deficiency payments.
    (2) For producers of triticale who obtain a payment under this 
subpart the producer must enter into an agreement with CCC to forgo any 
harvesting of triticale on the acreage for which such a payment is made.
    (e)(1) No payment will be made if the crop could not have been 
harvested because of weather conditions or any other reason.
    (2) The producer must retain the control, title and risk of loss in 
the commodity for which the payment is sought from the date of planting 
through the date on which mechanical harvesting of the crop would 
normally occur.
    (f) Producers who elect to graze 2002-2007 crop wheat, barley, oats, 
or triticale will not be eligible for an indemnity under the Federal 
Crop Insurance Program provision of Chapter IV of this title or a 
payment under Noninsured Crop Assistance Program authorized under part 
1437 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.304  Time and method for application.

    Application for the program provided in this subpart must be 
received, at the county office that is responsible for administering 
programs for the farm, no earlier than the date on which eligible crops 
would normally be harvested and no later than the final loan 
availability date as determined in accordance with Sec. 1421.5. The 
application must describe the land to be grazed and, in accordance with 
standards set by CCC, the tract/field location. The COC will determine 
the first harvest date which shall take into account the date on which 
such crops are, locally, normally harvested for any purpose. Where 
multiple producers are involved, the form must reflect each producer's 
share in the crop. No producer must receive payments under this subpart 
except to the extent that the payments are commensurate with that share. 
Should a person who is entitled to receive a payment under this subpart 
die, that payment, as earned, may be made to other persons as provided 
for in the rules set out in part 707. Third parties may also receive 
payments to the extent provided for in that part for other situations 
involving an incapacitation of the producer. Refusals to allow CCC to 
verify information on any form or report utilized for this subpart can 
result in program ineligibility and producers must provide CCC and its 
agent to the property involved and to all records as may be relevant to 
the making of payments under this subpart. Further, false statements 
will disqualify the producer from the program and may be subject to 
other sanctions including criminal sanctions.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.305  Payment amount.

    (a) The grazing payment rate shall be the loan deficiency payment in 
effect for the farm on the date which the producer submits a complete 
program application to CCC. For triticale, the loan deficiency payment 
rate will be equal to the rate for the predominant class of wheat in the 
county where the farm is located in effect as of the date of the 
application is filed.
    (b) The payable units of production shall be computed by multiplying 
the eligible grazed acres by the applicable yield determined under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The payment yield shall be the yield in effect for the 
calculation of direct payments under part 1412 of this chapter. In a 
case of a farm for which a farm program payment yield is unavailable for 
a covered commodity, an

[[Page 419]]

appropriate payment yield for the covered commodity on the farm will be 
determined by CCC taking into consideration the farm program payment 
yields applicable to the commodity using three (3) similar farms. For 
triticale, the payment yield shall be the yield for wheat from three (3) 
similar farms in that county.
    (d) No payment may be received or retained under this subpart to the 
extent that the payment, were they considered to be LDP's, would place 
that person over the per person per year payment limit that applies to 
LDP's. The producer agrees that the CCC may collect any payment 
considered to be an overpayment by reason of this subsection by 
withholding LDP payments until the matter is resolved, by treating the 
LDP as being not payable to the extent that a grazing refund would 
otherwise be due , by setoff, or by any other means available to CCC.
    (e) Payments can be withheld until the actual grazed acreage is 
verified and justified in connection with any other reports filed with 
FSA with respect to the farm (or filed with some other person or agency) 
and until all other necessary information is obtained. The CCC may 
require such other verification as it deems appropriate to assure that 
the program goals are met.
    (f) To receive the payment, the eligible producer must submit a 
request for payment on an application form as prescribed by CCC or FSA. 
The application may be obtained from the county FSA office, or from the 
USDA or FSA web site in the Internet. The form must be submitted to the 
county by the close of business on or before March 31 of the applicable 
crop year.
    (g) The producer will ineligible for payments under this subpart if 
any discrepancies between the reported acreage on the program form and 
other reports of acreage by the producer are not resolved by a date set 
by the CCC.
    (h) Unless otherwise authorized by the Deputy Administrator, all 
payment shall be made no later than September 28, 2001.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.306  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A producer shall be ineligible to receive payments under this 
subpart if it is determined by DAFP, the State committee, or the county 
committee to have:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device which tends to defeat the purpose 
of this program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this subpart to a producer 
engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, or to any other 
person as a result of the producer's actions, shall be refunded with 
interest together with such other sums as may become due. Any producer 
engaged in acts prohibited by this section and any person receiving 
payment under this subpart, as a result of such acts, shall be jointly 
and severally liable for any refund due under this section and for 
related charges. The remedies provided in this subpart shall be in 
addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies which may 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.307  Refunds; joint and several liability.

    (a) In the event there is a failure to comply with any term, 
requirement, or condition for payment arising under this application, or 
this subpart, and if any refund of a payment to CCC shall become due for 
that or other reason in connection with the application, or this 
subpart, all payments made under this subpart to any producer shall be 
refunded to CCC together with interest as determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section and late-payments charges as provided for 
in part 1402 of this chapter.
    (b) All persons listed on an application shall be jointly and 
severally liable for any refund due in connection with that application 
and for any related charges which may be determined to be due for any 
reason.
    (c) Interest shall be applicable to refunds required of the 
producer. Such interest shall be charged at the rate of interest which 
the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of

[[Page 420]]

the date CCC made such benefits available. Such interest shall accrue 
from the date such benefits were made available to the date of repayment 
but the interest rate shall increase to reflect any increase in the rate 
charged to CCC by Treasury for any percent of time for which the 
interest assessment is collected. CCC may waive the accrual of interest 
if CCC determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not 
due to any action of the producer.
    (d) Late payment interest shall be assessed on refunds in accordance 
with the provisions of, and subject to the rates in 7 CFR part 1403.
    (e) Producers must refund to CCC any excess payments made by CCC 
with respect to any application in which they have an interest. Such 
refund shall be subject to interest at the same rate that applies to 
other refunds.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.5551  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the initial or continuing approval by 
the Commodity Credit Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of 
warehouse(s) for the storage and handling of:
    (1) Wheat, oats, corn, rye, barley, sorghums, flaxseed, soybeans, 
sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, safflower, mustard, and such other 
oilseeds as the Secretary may determine under a Uniform Grain Storage 
Agreement (which commodities are hereinafter referred to as ``grain''),
    (2) Rough rice under a Uniform Rice Storage Agreement,
    (3) Milled rice under a Milled Rice Storage Agreement,
    (4) Dry Edible Beans under a Bean Storage Agreement, and
    (5) Seed under a Seed Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or 
held by CCC as security for price support loans.

This subpart is not applicable to grain, rough and milled rice, dry 
edible beans, and seed purchased in store for prompt shipment or to 
handling operations of a temporary nature.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by KCCO and a storage contract or 
agreement must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC 
will use such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering 
into of a storage contract or agreement does not constitute a commitment 
that CCC will use the warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman, when applying for approval under this subpart, 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-24, ``Application for Approval of Warehouse 
for Grain, Rice, Dry Edible Beans, and Seed'', and a completed Form CCC-
24-1, ``Supplement to Application for Approval of Warehouse for Grain, 
Rice, Dry Edible Beans, and Seed'',
    (2) A current financial statement prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles meeting the following 
requirements:
    (i) Each financial statement shall include, but not be limited to 
the following:
    (A) A balance sheet;
    (B) A statement of income (profit and loss);
    (C) Statement of retained earnings; and
    (D) A statement of changes in the financial position.
    (ii) Each financial statement shall be accompanied by one of the 
following:
    (A) A report of audit or review conducted by an independent CPA or 
an independent public accountant in accordance with standards 
established by

[[Page 421]]

the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The accountant's 
report of audit or review shall include the accountant's certifications, 
assurances, opinions, comments, and notes with respect to such financial 
statement, or
    (B) A compilation report of the financial statement which is 
prepared by a grain commission firm or a management firm if such firm 
has been authorized by the Deputy Vice President, CCC (Deputy 
Administrator, Commodity Operations, FSA) to provide a compilation 
report of financial statements of warehousemen.
    (iii) All financial statements shall be accompanied by a 
certification by the chief executive officer of the warehouseman, under 
penalty of perjury, that the financial statement(s) accurately reflects 
the financial condition of the warehouseman for the period specified in 
such statement.
    (iv) A current financial statement on Form WA-51-2, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51-2 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.
    (v) Only one financial statement is required for a chain of 
warehouses owned or operated by a single business entity. If approved by 
the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee, the financial statement 
of a parent company, which includes the financial position of a wholly-
owned subsidiary, may be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for 
the wholly-owned subsidiary.
    (3) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1421.5552(a)(2) and such 
other documents or information as CCC may require.
    (e) The provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall also be 
applicable to warehousemen who have an existing storage contract with 
CCC. Such warehousemen with existing storage contracts shall submit 
their financial statements to CCC in the manner prescribed reflecting 
their financial condition as of the close of the warehouseman's fiscal 
or calendar year's operation, whichever is applicable. Thereafter, the 
financial statements and the audit, review or compilation reports shall 
be furnished annually to reflect the warehouseman's fiscal or calendar 
year's operation, whichever is applicable, and at such other times as 
may be required by the AMS or CCC.

Sec. 1421.5552  Basic standards.

    Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, each warehouseman and 
each of the warehouses owned or operated by such warehouseman for which 
CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC owned or loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for 
hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a 
corporation, shall be authorized by its charter to engage in such 
business,
    (2) Have a current and valid license for the kind of storage 
operation for which the warehouseman seeks approval if such a license is 
required by State or local laws or regulations,
    (3) Have a net worth which is the greater of $50,000 or an amount 
which is computed by multiplying the maximum storage capacity of the 
warehouse (the total quantity of the commodity which the warehouseman 
desires to store and which the warehouse can accommodate when stored in 
the customary manner) under the approved contract with CCC times twenty-
five (25) cents per bushel in the case of grain, fifty (50) cents per 
hundredweight in the case of rough rice, eighty-five (85) cents per 
hundredweight in the case of milled rice, and sixty (60) cents per 
hundredweight in the case of dry edible beans. In the case of seed, the 
net worth of the warehouseman shall be at least equal to an amount which 
is computed by multiplying the estimated number of pounds of seed to be 
stored times seven (7) cents per pound. If this calculated net worth 
requirement exceeds $50,000, the

[[Page 422]]

warehouseman may satisfy any deficiency in net worth between the $50,000 
minimum requirement and such calculated net worth requirement by 
furnishing bonds, irrevocable letters of credit, or other acceptable 
substitute security meeting the requirements of Sec. 1421.5553.
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating 
expenses,

Storage Agreement, Bean Storage Agreement, or Seed Storage Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the load out capacity 
of any warehouse at a single location need not exceed the equivalent of 
200 railroad cars per day.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall have the 
necessary experience, organization, technical qualifications, and skills 
in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodities to 
enable them to provide proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials, and each of the supervisory employees 
of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall:
    (1) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and 
performance, and
    (2) Be neither suspended nor debarred under applicable CCC 
suspension and debarment regulations.
    (d) The warehouse shall:
    (1) Be of sound construction, in good state of repair, and 
adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the 
applicable commodity,

    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process in the State where the warehouse is located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC,
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than ninety (90) days or 
includes a rider providing for not less than ninety (90) days' notice to 
CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a substitute bond for one 
warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC against insufficient 
bond coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the

[[Page 423]]

warehouseman when the period for which coverage was required has ended 
and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the storage contract 
or agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.5554  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage or handling of commodities and periodically thereafter 
to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.5555  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart:
    (a) The financial, bond, and original and periodic warehouse 
examination provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman 
approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of 
commodities under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under the 
U.S. Warehouse Act for such commodities but a special examination shall 
be made of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is 
necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $50,000 but who 
fails or whose warehouse fails to meet one or more of the other 
standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity, and
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.5556  Approval of warehouses, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart, and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. The notice will state the cause(s) for such action. Unless 
the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1421.5552, other than the standard set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after 
receiving notice of such action, request reconsideration of the action 
and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of 
such request. The Director shall consider such information in making a 
determination and notify the warehouseman in writing of such 
determination. The warehouseman may, if

[[Page 424]]

dissatisfied with the Director's determination, obtain a review of the 
determination and an informal hearing thereon by filing an appeal with 
the Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency 
(hereinafter referred to as ``FSA''). The time of filing appeals, forms 
for requesting an appeal, nature of the informal hearing, determination 
and reopening of the hearing shall be as prescribed in the FSA 
regulations governing appeals, 7 CFR part 780. When appealing under such 
regulations, the warehouseman shall be considered as a ``participant''; 
and
    (2) In Sec. 1421.5552(c)(2), the warehouseman's administrative 
appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in 
accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period 
of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

Sec. 1421.5557  Exemption from requirements.

    If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of the subpart and no reasonable and economic alternative is 
available for securing such services for commodities under CCC programs, 
the President or Executive Vice President, CCC, may temporarily exempt, 
in writing, applicants for storage agreements and warehousemen who are 
currently under contract with CCC in such area from one or more of the 
standards of this subpart and may establish such other standards as are 
considered necessary to satisfactorily safeguard the interests of CCC.

    (a) Each warehouseman who has a non-federally licensed grain or rice 
warehouse in States that do not have a Cooperative Agreement with CCC 
for warehouse examinations must pay an annual contract fee to CCC for 
each such warehouse which is approved by CCC or for which CCC approval 
is sought as follows:
    (1) A warehouseman who has an existing agreement with CCC for the 
storage or handling of CCC-owned commodities or commodities pledged to 
CCC as loan collateral must pay an annual contract fee for each 
warehouse approved under that agreement in advance of the renewal date 
of such agreement.
    (2) All grain and rice warehousemen who do not have an existing 
agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned commodities 
or commodities pledged to CCC as loan collateral but who desire such an 
agreement must pay an application and inspection fee for each warehouse 
for which CCC approval is sought prior to CCC conducting the original 
warehouse examination. The annual contract fee must be paid by the 
warehouseman to CCC prior to the time that the agreement is entered 
into.
    (3) The contract fee will be prorated based upon the total number of 
months for which the contract is to be effective.
    (4) CCC may, upon the request of a warehouseman, conduct an 
examination of a warehouse for the sole benefit of the warehouseman and 
such warehouseman shall pay to CCC a fee equal to 1\1/2\ times the 
amount of the warehouseman's annual contract fee for such examination.
    (b) Any subsequent changes in the contract and application fees 
shall be announced in the Federal Register.

 Subpart--Standards for Approval of Dry and Cold Storage Warehouses for 
   Processed Agricultural Commodities, Extracted Honey, and Bulk Oils

    Source: 44 FR 67081, Nov. 23, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1423.1  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the approval by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of warehouse(s) for the 
storage and handling of:
    (1) Dry or refrigerated processed agricultural commodities under a 
Processed Commodities Storage Agreement (hereinafter referred to as 
``processed commodities''),
    (2) Bulk oils, under a Contract or Agreement for Tank Storage, which 
are owned by CCC or held by CCC as collateral for price support loans, 
and
    (3) Extracted Honey (hereinafter referred to as ``honey'') under a 
Honey Storage Agreement, either in bulk or in containers meeting 
specifications in the applicable honey price support regulations, which 
is owned by CCC or held by CCC as security for price support loans. This 
subpart shall not apply to processed commodities, extracted honey, and 
bulk oils purchased in store by CCC for prompt shipment or to handling 
of commodities.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by KCCO and a storage contract or 
agreement must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC 
will use such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering 
into of a storage contract or agreement does not constitute a commitment 
that CCC will use the warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman when applying for approval under this subpart, 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-560, ``Application for Approval of 
Warehouse (Processed Commodities)'', or Form CCC-513, ``Application for 
Approval of Tank Farm'', or Form CCC-55, ``Application for Approval of 
Warehouse for Honey Storage Contract'', whichever is applicable,
    (2) A current financial statement on Form WA-51, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee. 
Financial statements shall show the financial condition of the 
warehouseman as of a date no earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the 
date of the warehouseman's application, or such other date as CCC may 
prescribe. Additional financial statements shall be furnished annually 
and at such other times as CCC may require. CCC also may require that 
financial statements prepared by the warehouseman or by a public 
accountant be examined by an independent certified public accountant in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Only one 
financial statement is required for a chain of warehouses owned

[[Page 426]]

or operated by a single business entity. If approved by the Director, 
KCCO, or the Director's designee, the financial statement of a parent 
company, which includes the financial position of a wholly-owned 
subsidiary, may be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for the 
wholly-owned subsidiary.
    (3) Copies of the warehouseman's tariff and any changes thereto, and
    (4) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1423.2(a)(2) and such other 
documents or information as CCC may require.

<R05>
Sec. 1423.2  Basic standards.

    Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, each warehouseman and 
each of the warehouses owned or operated by such warehouseman for which 
CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC-owned or loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for 
hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a 
corporation, shall be authorized by its charter to engage in such 
business.
    (2) Have a current and valid license for the kind of storage 
operation for which the warehouseman seeks approval if such a license is 
required by State or local laws or regulations.
    (3) Have a net worth which is the greater of $25,000 or (i) for 
dairy and other processed commodities (other than those shown in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the amount which results from 
multiplying five (5) percent of the current purchase price, times the 
quantity of the commodity to be stored; (ii) for honey, sugar and bulk 
oils, the amount which results from multiplying the storage capacity of 
the flat warehouse space available to CCC or the maximum capacity of the 
bulk tank(s), whichever is applicable, times five (5) percent of the 
current loan value for honey and sugar and five (5) percent of the 
current market value for bulk oils. The net worth need not exceed 
$250,000. If the calculated net worth exceeds $25,000, the warehouseman 
may satisfy any deficiency in net worth between the $25,000 minimum 
requirement and such calculated net worth by furnishing bonds (or 
acceptable substitute security) meeting the requirements of Sec. 1423.3,
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating 
expenses,
    (5) Have satisfactory corrected, upon request by CCC, any 
deficiencies in the performance of any storage contract or agreement 
with CCC,
    (6) Use only warehouse receipts or such other documents as CCC may 
prescribe,
    (7) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,
    (8) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable 
firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored 
commodity, and
    (9) Have a work force and equipment available to complete loadout as 
stated below or as CCC may prescribe:
    (i) Forty-five (45) working days of the total quantity of all honey 
and processed commodities stored for CCC.
    (ii) Seventy-five (75) working days of that quantity of bulk oils 
for which the warehouse is or may be approved under a contract with CCC.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall have the 
necessary experience, organization technical qualifications, and skills 
in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodity to enable 
them to provide proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials, and each of the supervisory employees 
of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall:
    (1) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and 
performance, and
    (2) Be neither suspended nor debarred under applicable CCC 
suspension and debarment regulations.
    (d) The warehouse shall:
    (1) Be of sound construction, in good state of repair, and 
adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the 
applicable commodity,

[[Page 427]]

    (2) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all 
times. If a warehouse is leased by the warehouseman, a copy of the 
written lease agreement must be furnished to CCC at the time the 
warehouseman applies for approval under this subpart. The lease 
agreement must be renewable and must provide that the lessor cannot 
cancel the agreement without giving at least 120 days notice to the 
warehouseman. All leases are subject to approval by the CCC Contracting 
Officer, and
    (3) Not be subject to greater than normal risk of fire, flood or 
other hazards.

Sec. 1423.3  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process in the State where the warehouse is located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC.
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than one hundred twenty (120) 
days or includes a rider providing for not less than one hundred twenty 
(120) days' notice to CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a 
substitute bond for one warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC 
against insufficient bond coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage contract or agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

Sec. 1423.4  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage or handling of commodities and periodically thereafter 
to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1423.5  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart:
    (a) The financial, bond, and original and periodic warehouse

approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of 
commodities under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under the 
U.S. Warehouse Act for such

[[Page 428]]

commodities, but a special examination shall be made of such warehouse 
whenever CCC determines such action is necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $25,000 but who 
fails, or whose warehouse fails, to meet one or more of the other 
standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity, and
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1423.6  Approval of warehouse, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart; and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. The notice will state the cause(s) for such action. Unless 
the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1423.2, other than the standard set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after receiving notice 
of such action, request reconsideration of the action and present to the 
Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of such request. The 
Director shall consider such information in making a determination and 
notify the warehouseman in writing of such determination. The 
warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's determination, 
obtain a review of the determination and an informal hearing thereon by 
filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, 
Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as ``FSA''). The time of 
filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, nature of the informal 
hearing, determination and reopening of the hearing shall be as 
prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 7 CFR part 780. 
When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman shall be 
considered as a ``participant'''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1423.2(c)(2), the warehouseman's administrative appeal 
rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in accordance 
with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period of 
suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1423.7  Exemption from requirements.

    (a) If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of this subpart, and no reasonable and economical alternative 
is available for securing such services, the President or Executive Vice 
President, CCC, may exempt, in writing, applicants in such area from one 
or more of the standards of this subpart and may establish such other 
standards as are considered necessary to safeguard satisfactorily the 
interests of CCC.
    (b) Warehousemen who are currently under contract with CCC will be 
required to meet the terms and conditions of these regulations at the 
time of renewal of their contract.

Sec. 1424.4  General eligibility rules.

    To obtain Program payments, a producer must do all of the following:
    (a) Obtain an Agreement, Form CCC-850, from the KCCO, Contract 
Reconciliation Division, STOP 8758, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, 
Missouri 64141-6205 or via the internet at: www.fsa.usda.gov/daco/
bioenergy/bioenergy.htm;
    (b) Submit a completed Agreement, Form CCC-850, to CCC no later than 
October 1 of each year or a later date, if announced by CCC, to KCCO, 
Contract Reconciliation Division, STOP 8758, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas 
City, Missouri 64141-6205;
    (c) Be assigned an Agreement number by KCCO indicating the producer 
is eligible for program payments;
    (d) Maintain records indicating:
    (1) Commodities for which it seeks payment;
    (2) The quantity of bioenergy produced from an eligible commodity by 
location during the quarter FY to date compared to the same time period 
in the previous FY; and
    (3) The quantity of eligible commodity used to produce the bioenergy 
stated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section during the quarter FY to date 
compared to the same time period in the previous FY;
    (e) Furnish CCC such certification, and access to such records, as 
CCC considers necessary to verify compliance with Program provisions;

satisfaction that both the producer's net purchases of eligible 
commodities and net production of bioenergy increased as compared to 
such production at all locations during the relevant base period. Except 
as otherwise provided for by CCC, the increase in production must equal 
or exceed that amount of energy production which would be calculated 
using the gross amount of agricultural commodities which forms the basis 
of the payment and the conversion factor set out in Sec. 1424.2. 
Example: A producer that purchases soy oil from a soybean crushing plant 
for further refinement into biodiesel must be able to prove to CCC's 
satisfaction that both soy oil purchases and biodiesel production 
increased for the applicable quarter;
    (h) Certify the accuracy and truthfulness of the information 
provided in their Agreement on Form CCC-850; and
    (i) Allow verification by CCC of all information provided. Refusal

deadline will be the next business day;
    (d) Submit other relevant documents as required by CCC for the 
specific commodity; and
    (e) Certify with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of the 
information provided.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.6  Eligibility determinations.

    (a) Applicants will, after Agreements are submitted, if:
    (1) Determined eligible, receive notification of eligibility;
    (2) Determined ineligible, be notified in writing of ineligibility 
for program participation and reason for the determination; or
    (3) Additional information is needed for CCC to determine 
eligibility, be contacted for additional supporting documentation.
    (b) Applicants will, after Applications are submitted, if:
    (1) Determined eligible, receive payment;
    (2) Determined ineligible, be notified in writing of ineligibility 
for payment and reason for determination; or
    (3) Additional information is needed for CCC to determine 
eligibility, be contacted for additional supporting documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.7  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1424.8  Payment amounts.

    (a) Eligible producer may be paid the amount specified in this 
section, subject to the availability of funds. Funds shall be considered 
available only to the extent determined appropriate by CCC. Unless 
otherwise determined by CCC, that amount shall be no more than $150 
million in FY 2001 and no more than an additional $150 million in FY 
2002.
    (b) Eligible producer must sign an agreement to participate. Such an 
agreement must be signed during the designated sign-up period. 
Thereafter, producers must file a report of their production at all 
locations for the program year to date through the respective quarter 
for each such report. Such reports must comply with the terms of the 
agreement and these regulations.
    (c) Persons will be eligible for payments only to the extent that 
their production of eligible energy from eligible inputs is, for the 
program year to date, as compared to the comparable portion of the 
previous year, in excess of their total comparable production at all 
locations. Producers will not be paid twice for the same increase and 
any decline in relative production between quarters will require a 
comparable refund as specified below. That is, for example, if a 
producer were to be paid, at the end of the first quarter, for an 
increase of 500 units of energy production, but by the end of the second 
quarter that producer's production, for the year to date, was down to a 
net increase for the year of 450 units, then a refund would be due for 
the loss of the corresponding 50 units of net extra production. For 
these purposes unless CCC shall agree otherwise in order to facilitate 
the program, ``all locations'' for these and other purposes within these 
regulations shall mean any and all locations in which the producer had 
an interest now (in the current FY) or in the previous FY, irrespective 
of whether the producer still has such an interest in that facility. 
Eligibility determinations will be made on the basis of aggregating 
production figures from all such locations and shall include production 
by all persons at those locations for the current and preceding FY, not 
just the production of the producer. Also, the CCC may in the program 
agreement require that the producer certify the amount of the actual

[[Page 432]]

increased use of agricultural commodities for energy production at all 
such locations for the relevant period and make adjustment in the 
formulaic payments that would otherwise be made to the producer if there 
is a difference between that certification and the amount of increased 
commodity use as calculated under the formula.
    (d) The submitted agreements filed during the sign-up period will 
require that the applicant set out the expected increase in production 
and other information as the agency may demand. Based on expected 
commodity prices, following the formula set out in this section, all 
such submissions will be assigned an expected value. Should the total 
expected value of all such agreements exceed the available funding, then 
a proration factor will be developed to factor the agreements down to 
the funding made available by CCC.
    (e) Subject to the provisions of this section and conditions 
specified in the Agreement, a producer's payment eligibility shall be 
adjusted at the end of each quarter, and figured as follows:
    (1) The extra production in energy from eligible inputs will be 
converted to gross payable bushels (or other applicable agricultural 
unit) by, unless otherwise determined by CCC:
    (i) Allowing, as applicable, 1 bushel of corn for each increase of 
2.5 gallons of ethanol;
    (ii) Allowing, as applicable, 1 bushel of soybeans for each increase 
of 1.4 gallons of biodiesel production;
    (iii) Such other method for other eligible agricultural commodities 
as CCC deems appropriate.
    (2) The gross payable bushels, or other gross units, calculated 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall then be converted to a net 
payable bushel (or other unit amount) by:
    (i) For producers whose annual bioenergy production is less than 65 
million gallons, allowing 1 net payable bushel for every 2.5 gross 
payable bushels of corn or soybeans, or by allowing a similar conversion 
in the event that there are other eligible agricultural commodities 
involved in the calculation;
    (ii) For producers whose annual bioenergy production is equal to or 
more than 65 million gallons, allowing 1 net payable bushel for every 
3.5 gross payable bushels of corn or soybeans, or by allowing a similar 
conversion in the event that there are other eligible commodities 
involved;
    (3) The net payable bushel (or other unit) agricultural commodity 
amount calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, shall be then 
converted to a gross payment by multiplying that commodity amount by the 
per unit value for the commodity determined as follows:
    (i) For those agricultural commodities with established terminal 
market prices, the CCC will use the applicable terminal market price for 
the last day of the program quarter announced daily by the KCCO, FSA, 
adjusted by the county average differential for the county in which the 
plant is located and the applicable quality factors determined by CCC. 
For this purpose the terminal market and differential used by CCC in 
determining different values for different locations will, to the extent 
practical, be the same as that used for producers under other major CCC 
commodity programs for determining marketing loan gains and other 
matters.
    (ii) For those agricultural commodities that do not, as determined 
by CCC, have acceptable established terminal prices, the price shall be 
as determined by CCC based on such market data as appears to be 
appropriate for a fair evaluation.
    (4) The gross payment calculated under paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section shall be reduced to a net payment by multiplying the gross 
payment figure by the proration factor determined under paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (5) Subject to other provisions of this section, producers shall be 
paid the net current payment, if positive, determined for the first 
quarter.
    (6) After the first quarter, adjustments shall be made based on 
changes in production. New or renewed increases shall be paid using the 
formula set out above using current per unit values. Refunds, when due, 
shall be due at the per unit values at which they were paid unless CCC 
determines otherwise.
    (7) If despite or in the absence of a proration under paragraph (d) 
of this

[[Page 433]]

section funds shall not be sufficient to cover payments due for any 
quarter then CCC shall prorate, or further prorate, the claims in such 
manner as CCC deems fit.
    (8) No producer may receive more than five percent of the available 
funding for this program and determinations of payment eligibility shall 
take that limit into account.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.9  Reports required.

    Once an eligible producer has submitted an Agreement, Form CCC-850, 
that producer shall file information for each bioenergy producing 
facility quarterly through the end of the applicable FY as specified by 
CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.10  Succession and control of facilities and production.

    A person who obtains a facility which is under contract under this 
part may request permission to succeed to the program contract and CCC 
may grant such request if it is determined that permitting such 
succession would serve the purposes of the program. As determined to be 
appropriate, CCC may require the consent of the original party to such 
succession and likewise CCC may terminate a contract and demand a full 
refund of payments made if a contracting party loses control of a 
facility whose increased production is the basis of a program payment or 
otherwise fails to retain the ability to assure that all program 
obligations and requirements will be met.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.11  Maintenance and inspection of records.

    For the purpose of verifying compliance with the requirements of 
this part, each eligible producer shall make available at one place at 
all reasonable times for examination by representatives of USDA, all 
books, papers, records, contracts, scale tickets, settlement sheets, 
invoices, written price quotations, or other documents related to the 
program that is within the control of such entity for not less than 3 
years from the payment date.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.12  Appeals.

    (a) Any producer who is subject to an adverse determination made 
under this part shall have a right to appeal the determination by filing 
a written request with the Deputy Administrator at the following 
address: Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, Farm Service 
Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, STOP 0550, 1400 
Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-0550.
    (b) Any producer who believes that they have been adversely affected 
by a determination under this part must seek review with the Deputy 
Administrator within thirty days of such determination, unless provided 
with notice by FSA which provides a different time for appealing.
    (c) Any producer who believes that they have been adversely affected 
by a determination by the Agency, must seek review with the Deputy 
Administrator before any other review may be requested within the 
Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.13  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A producer shall be ineligible to receive payments under this 
program if CCC determines the producer:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device which tends to defeat the purpose 
of the program in this part;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this part to a producer engaged 
in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, or to any other person as a 
result of the bioenergy producer's actions, shall be refunded with 
interest together with such other sums as may become due, plus damages 
as may be determined by CCC.
    (c) Interest charged under this part shall at the rate of interest 
which the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date 
CCC made such funds available. Such interest shall accrue from the date 
such payments were made available to the date of repayment or the date 
interest increases as determined in accordance with applicable 
regulations.
    (d) CCC may waive the accrual of interest and or damages if CCC 
determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to 
any action of the bioenergy producer.

[[Page 434]]

    (e) Any producer or person engaged in an act prohibited by this 
section and any producer or person receiving payment under this part 
shall be jointly and severally liable for any refund due under this part 
and for related charges.
    (f) The remedies provided in this part shall be in addition to other 
civil, criminal, or administrative remedies which may apply.
    (g) Late payment interest shall be assessed on all refunds in 
accordance with the provisions of, and subject to the rates prescribed 
in, 7 CFR part 1403.
    (h) Other limitations may apply.

<R05>
Sec. 1425.15  Vested authority.

    The marketing agreement between the CMA and its members shall give 
the CMA the authority to pledge the commodity as collateral for a loan,

any eligible commodity in a loan pool as provided in paragraph (e) of 
this section and the beneficial interest provisions of parts 1421 and 
1427 of this chapter.
    (c) A pool shall be eligible for loans and LDP's if:
    (1) All of the commodity in the pool is eligible for loans or LDP's, 
except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section;

CMA in accordance with Sec. 1425.18(a).
    (d) Ineligible commodities may be included in eligible pools when:
    (1) The CMA inadvertently included ineligible quantities based on 
grade, quality, bale weight or repacking in the case of cotton, or other 
factors; or
    (2) There are eligibility discrepancies within FSA records, the 
producer has certified to the CMA that the commodity is eligible for 
loan, and there is no market gain or LDP involved in the loan pool for 
the crop year.
    (e) A CMA may, for a period of time as specified in Handbook 1-CMA, 
include a commodity that is ineligible based on FSA records when the 
producer has certified to the CMA the commodity is eligible. In these 
instances, CCC specifies a time period during which CMA's may obtain 
loan or LDP's on the applicable quantity while the eligibility status is 
resolved. If the final resolution is that the commodity was ineligible, 
the CMA must repay any loans outstanding with principal plus interest 
and any market gains obtained plus interest from the date of receiving 
the market gain through the repayment date.

agreements or the CMA shall obtain a completed form CCC-679, Lien

CMA shall provide CCC the completed CCC-679. CMA's shall not take any 
action to cause a lien or encumbrance to be placed on a commodity after 
a loan is approved.
    (k) If a loan or LDP is obtained for any quantity in a loan pool, 
allocations of costs and expenses among separate pools for the commodity 
in the pool shall be made according to generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (l) A CMA shall not apply marketing losses from a commodity not used 
to obtain a loan or LDP against the marketing proceeds of a commodity 
used to obtain a loan or LDP.
    (m) CMA's shall not carry forward losses from one loan pool and 
apply them against a subsequent loan pool without CCC's authorization. 
CCC may grant authorization when it determines that carrying forward the 
loss complies with CCC's loan and LDP program intent.
    (n) The CMA is responsible to CCC for any loss related to 
commodities the CMA pledged as collateral for loan or used to obtain LDP 
related to:
    (1) The CMA failing to comply with these regulations;

the CMA necessary to condition the commodity or otherwise make the 
commodity eligible for loans or LDP's; and
    (iii) Within 15 work days from the date the CMA receives loan or LDP 
proceeds from CCC, except when loans are redeemed within 15 work days of 
the date of the loan.
    (2) CMA's may credit advances to its members made before loans and 
LDP's are obtained against the distribution of loan and LDP proceeds 
requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, loan 
pool proceeds shall not be combined with non-loan pool proceeds and the 
CMA shall distribute loan pool proceeds according to the information it 
provided CCC in accordance with Sec. 1425.4(b)(7).
    (2) Sales proceeds from a loan pool may be combined with sales 
proceeds from other pools if the proceeds from such pools are allocated

deficiency payment programs are available from FSA offices. The forms 
for use in connection with the programs in this subpart shall be

    (e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize 
State or county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other 
program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such

the marketing assistance and loan deficiency payment programs.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute marketing assistance loan 
and Loan deficiency payment applications and related documents only 
under the terms and conditions determined and announced by CCC. Any

agreement with CCC, each such producer shall be jointly and severally 
liable for the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and the 
regulations in this part. Each such producer shall also remain liable 
for repayment of the entire marketing assistance loan amount until the 
loan is fully repaid without regard to such producer's claimed share in 
the commodity pledged as collateral for the loan. In addition, such 
producer may not amend the note and security agreement with respect to 
the producer's claimed share in such commodities, or loan proceeds, 
after execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.
    (2) The cotton in a bale may have been produced by two or more 
eligible producers on one or more farms if the bale is not a repacked 
bale.
    (e) A CMA may obtain a marketing assistance loan and loan deficiency 
payments on eligible cotton on behalf of its members who are eligible to 
receive loans or loan deficiency payments for a crop of cotton. For 
purposes of this subpart, the term ``producer'' includes a CMA.
    (f) In case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any producer 
who is entitled to the payment of any sum in settlement of a marketing

cotton which is tendered to CCC for a marketing assistance loan or loan 
deficiency payment. The producer must always have had the beneficial 
interest in the cotton unless, before the cotton was harvested, the 
producer, and a former producer whom the producer tendering the cotton 
to CCC has succeeded, had such an interest in the cotton. Cotton 
obtained by gift, barter or purchase shall not be eligible to be 
tendered to CCC for marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency 
payments.

[[Page 446]]

Heirs who succeed to the beneficial interest of a deceased producer or 
who assume the decedent's obligations under an existing marketing 
assistance loan shall be eligible to receive marketing assistance loans 
and loan deficiency payments whether succession to the cotton occurs 
before or after harvest so long as the heir otherwise complies with this 
part.
    (2) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the cotton if the producer retains control, 
title, and risk of loss in the cotton, including the right to make all 
decisions regarding the tender of the cotton to CCC for marketing 
assistance loans or loan deficiency payments including those cases where 
the producer:
    (i) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, for such cotton if 
all other eligibility requirements are met and the option to purchase 
contains the following:

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title; risk of loss; and beneficial interest in the commodity, as 
specified in 7 CFR 1427.5, shall remain with the producer until the 
buyer exercises this option to purchase the commodity. This option to 
purchase shall expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either 
the producer or the buyer, at the earlier of: (1) The maturity of any 
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loan which is secured by such 
commodity; (2) the date CCC claims title to such commodity; or (3) such 
other date as provided in this option.

    (ii) Enters into a contract to sell the cotton if the producer 
retains title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the commodity 
and the purchaser pays no advance payment amount or any incentive 
payment amount to enter into such contract, except as provided in part 
1425 of this chapter; or
    (iii) Executes a designation of agent on a form prescribed by CCC. 
Such designation:
    (A) Allows the producer to authorize an agent or subsequent agent to 
redeem all or a portion of the cotton pledged as collateral for a 
marketing assistance loan;
    (B) Identifies the warehouse receipts for which the authorization is 
given;
    (C) Expires upon maturity of the marketing assistance loan;
    (D) Allows agents so designated by the producer to designate a 
subsequent agent by endorsement of the form by the agent;
    (E) Must be presented at the time the marketing assistance loan is 
repaid at the county office or loan servicing agent where such loan 
originated if the agent or subsequent agent exercises any authority 
granted by the producer, unless the producer provides authorization to 
CCC to use an electronic agent designation as the basis for accepting 
redemption of some or all bales of the specified loan; and
    (F) May be canceled by the producer by providing the custodial 
office a written request signed and dated by the producer showing the 
name of the agent, the loan number, and the bales applicable to the 
Cooperating Ginners' Bagging and Bale Ties Certification and Agreement 
that was provided by the Agency. The effective date of the cancellation 
shall be the date the request is received by the custodial office.
    (3) If marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments are 
made available to producers through a CMA under part 1425 of this 
chapter, the beneficial interest in the cotton must always have been in 
the producer-member who delivered the cotton to the CMA or its member, 
except as otherwise provided in this section. Cotton delivered to such a 
CMA shall not be eligible to receive a marketing assistance loan or a 
loan deficiency payment if the producer-member who delivered the cotton 
does not retain the right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of 
the cotton as provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (f) If the person tendering cotton for a loan or a loan deficiency 
payment is a landowner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper, such cotton 
must represent such person's separate share of the crop and must not 
have been acquired by such person directly or indirectly from a 
landowner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper.
    (g) Each bale of upland cotton sampled by the warehouse operator 
upon initial receipt which has not been sampled by the ginner must not 
show more than one sample hole on each side of

[[Page 447]]

the bale. If more than one sample is desired when the bale is received 
by the warehouse operator, the sample shall be cut across the width of 
the bale, broken in half or split lengthwise, and otherwise drawn under 
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) dimension and weight requirements. 
This requirement will not prohibit sampling of the cotton at a later 
date if authorized by the producer.
    (h) Marketing assistance loans may be disbursed to eligible 
producers who store upland cotton in unlicenced storage facilities only 
if the producer agrees to redeem the marketing assistance loan on the 
date on which the loan is disbursed with a commodity certificate 
exchange.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.6  Disbursement of loans.

    (a) Disbursement of loans to individual producers may be made by:
    (1) County in CCC and FSA offices;
    (2) Loan servicing agents; or
    (3) An approved cotton clerk who has entered into a written 
agreement with CCC on a form prescribed by CCC.
    (b) Loan proceeds may be disbursed by CCC or a cotton commercial 
bank.
    (c) The loan documents shall not be presented for disbursement 
unless the cotton covered by the mortgage or pledged as security is 
eligible under Sec. 1427.5. If the cotton was not eligible cotton at the 
time of disbursement, the total amount disbursed under the loan, and 
charges plus interest shall be refunded promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.7  Maturity of loans.

    (a)(1) Form A loans and Form G loans mature on demand by CCC and no 
later than the last day of the 9th calendar month following the month in 
which the note and security agreement is filed under Sec. 1427.5(a).
    (2) CCC may at any time accelerate the loan maturity date by 
providing the producer notice of such acceleration at least 30 days in 
advance of the accelerated maturity date.
    (b) If the loan is not repaid by the loan maturity date, title to 
the cotton shall vest in CCC the day after such maturity date and CCC 
shall have no obligation to pay for any market value which such cotton 
may have in excess of the amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.8  Amount of loan.

    (a) The loan rates for crops of upland cotton and ELS cotton will be 
determined and announced by CCC and made available at State and county 
offices.
    (b) The quantity of cotton which may be pledged as collateral for a 
loan shall be the net weight of the eligible cotton as shown on the 
warehouse receipt issued by an approved warehouse, except that in the 
case of a bale which has a net weight of more than 600 pounds, the 
weight to be used in determining the amount of the loan on the bale 
shall be 600 pounds. Cotton pledged as collateral for loans on the basis 
of reweights will not be accepted by CCC.
    (c) The amount of the loan for each bale will be determined by 
multiplying the net weight of the bale, as determined under paragraph 
(b) of this section by the applicable loan rate.
    (d) CCC will not increase the amount of the loan made for any bale 
of cotton as a result of a redetermination of the quantity or quality of 
the bale after it is tendered to CCC, except that if it is established 
to the satisfaction of CCC that a bona fide error was made for the 
weight of the bale or the classification for the bale, such error may be 
corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.9  Classification of cotton.

    (a) References made to ``classification'' in this subpart shall 
include color grade, leaf, staple length, extraneous matter and 
micronaire, and for upland cotton, strength readings. All cotton 
tendered for loan must be classed by an AMS Cotton Classing Office or 
other entity approved by CCC and tendered on the basis of such 
classification.
    (b) An AMS cotton classification or other entity's classification 
acceptable by CCC showing the classification of a bale must be based 
upon a representative sample drawn from the bale under instructions to 
samplers drawing samples under AMS procedures.
    (c) If the producer's cotton has not been classed or sampled in a 
manner acceptable by CCC, the warehouse shall sample such cotton and 
forward the

[[Page 448]]

samples to the AMS Cotton Classing Office or other entity approved by 
CCC serving the district in which the cotton is located. Such warehouse 
must be licensed by AMS or be approved by CCC to draw samples for 
submission to the AMS Cotton Classing Office or other entity approved by 
CCC.
    (d) If a sample has been submitted for classification, another 
sample shall not be drawn, except for a review classification.
    (e) Where review classification is not involved, if through error or 
otherwise two or more samples from the same bale are submitted for 
classification, the loan rate shall be based on the classification 
having the lower loan value.
    (f) If a review classification is obtained, the loan value of the 
cotton represented thereby will be based on such review classification.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.10  Approved storage.

    (a) Eligible cotton may be pledged as collateral for loans only if 
stored at warehouses approved by CCC.
    (1) Persons desiring approval of their facilities should contact the 
Kansas City Commodity Office, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 
64141-6205.
    (2) The names of approved warehouses may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office or from State or county offices.
    (b) When the operator of a warehouse receives notice from CCC that a 
loan has been made by CCC on a bale of cotton, the operator shall, if 
such cotton is not stored within the warehouse, promptly place such 
cotton within such warehouse.
    (c) Warehouse charges paid by a producer will not be refunded by 
CCC.
    (d) The approved storage requirements provided in this section may 
be waived by CCC if the producer requests a loan deficiency payment 
pursuant to the loan deficiency payment provisions contained in 
Sec. 1427.23.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.11  Warehouse receipts.

    (a) Producers may obtain loans on eligible cotton represented by 
warehouse receipts only if the warehouse receipts meet the definition of 
a warehouse receipt and provide for delivery of the cotton to bearer or 
are properly assigned by endorsement in blank, so as to vest title in 
the holder of the receipt or are otherwise acceptable to CCC. The 
warehouse receipt must:
    (1) Contain the gin bale number;
    (2) Contain the warehouse receipt number;
    (3) Be dated on or before the date the producer signs the note and 
security agreement.
    (b) Warehouse receipts, under Sec. 1427.3, when issued as block 
warehouse receipts will be accepted when authorized by CCC only if the 
owner of the warehouse issuing the block warehouse receipt owns the 
cotton represented by the block warehouse receipt and the warehouse is 
not licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.
    (c)(1) Each receipt must set out in its written or printed terms the 
tare and the net weight of the bale represented thereby. The net weight 
shown on the warehouse receipt shall be the difference between the gross 
weight as determined by the warehouse at the warehouse site and the tare 
weight. The warehouse receipt may show the net weight established at a 
gin if:
    (i) The gin is in the immediate vicinity of the warehouse and is 
operated under common ownership with such warehouse or in any other case 
in which the showing of gin weights on the warehouse receipts is 
approved by CCC; and
    (ii) Gin weights are permitted by the licensing authority for the 
warehouse.
    (2) The tare shown on the receipt shall be the tare furnished to the 
warehouse by the ginner or entered by the ginner on the gin bale tag. A 
machine card type warehouse receipt reflecting an alteration in gross, 
tare, or net weight will not be accepted by CCC unless it bears, on the 
face of the receipt, the following legend or similar wording approved by 
CCC, duly executed by the warehouse or an authorized representative of 
the warehouse:

Corrected (gross, tare, or net) weight,
(Name of warehouse),
By (Signature or initials),
Date.

    (3) Alterations in other inserted data on a machine card type 
warehouse receipt must be initialed by an authorized representative of 
the warehouse.
    (d) If warehouse storage charges have been paid, the receipt must 
show that

[[Page 449]]

date through which the storage charges have been paid.
    (e) If warehouse receiving charges have been paid or waived, the 
warehouse receipt must show such fact. Except for bales stored in the 
States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Virginia, if receiving charges due on the bale include a charge, if any, 
for a new set of ties for compressing flat bales tied with ties which 
cannot be reused, the warehouse receipt must indicate the receiving 
charges and include a charge for new set of ties. If the bale is stored 
at a warehouse not having compress facilities and bales shipped from the 
warehouse are normally compressed in transit, the warehouse receipt must 
show the bale ties are not suitable for reuse when the bale is 
compressed and charges will be assessed by the nearest compress in line 
of transit for furnishing new bale ties.
    (f) In any case where loan collateral is forfeited, any unpaid 
storage or receiving charges, not to exceed the amount that accrued from 
the date that all necessary documents were received by CCC to the 
maturity date, will be paid to the warehouse by CCC after loan maturity 
or as soon as practicable after the cotton is ordered shipped by CCC.
    (g) The warehouse receipt must show the compression status of the 
bale; i.e., flat, modified flat, standard, gin standard, standard 
density (short), gin universal, universal density (short), or warehouse 
universal density. The receipt must show if the compression charge has 
been paid, or if the warehouse claims no lien for such compression.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.12  Liens.

    If there are any liens or encumbrances on the cotton tendered as 
collateral for a loan, waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC 
must be obtained before disbursement even though the liens or 
encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional liens 
or encumbrances shall be placed on the cotton after the loan is 
approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.13  Fees, charges and interest.

    (a) A producer shall pay a nonrefundable loan service fee to CCC or, 
if applicable, to a loan servicing agent, at a rate determined by CCC. 
Such fee shall be in addition to a cotton clerk fee paid under paragraph 
(b) of this section. The fee amounts are available in State and county 
offices and are shown on the note and security agreement. Fees shall be 
deducted from the loan proceeds.
    (b) Cotton clerks may only charge fees for the preparation of loan 
or loan deficiency payment documents at the rate determined by CCC.
    (1) Such fees may be deducted from the loan or loan deficiency 
payment proceeds instead of the fees being paid in cash.
    (2) The amount of such fees is available from CCC and is shown on 
the note and security agreement.
    (c) Interest which accrues for a loan shall be determined under part 
1405 of this chapter. All or a portion of such interest may be waived 
for a quantity of upland cotton which has been redeemed under 
Sec. 1427.19 at a level which is less than the principal amount of the 
loan plus charges and interest.
    (d) For each crop of upland cotton, the producer, as defined in the 
Cotton Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. 2101), shall remit to CCC an 
assessment which shall be transmitted by CCC to the Cotton Board and 
shall be deducted from the:
    (1) Loan proceeds for a crop of cotton and shall be at a rate equal 
to one dollar per bale plus up to one percent of the loan amount; and
    (2) Loan deficiency payment proceeds for a crop of cotton and shall 
be at a rate equal to up to one percent of the loan deficiency payment 
amount.
    (e) If the producers elects to forfeit the loan collateral to CCC, 
the producer shall pay to CCC, at the rates that are specified in the 
storage agreement between the warehouse and CCC, the following accrued 
warehouse charges:
    (1) All warehouse storage charges associated with the forfeited 
cotton that accrued before the date that all required documents were 
provided to CCC; and

[[Page 450]]

    (2) Any accrued warehouse receiving charges associated with the 
forfeited cotton, including, if applicable, charges for new ties as 
specified in Sec. 1427.11.

or firm which made the loan or loan deficiency payment advances or to 
such financial institution and such person or firm as joint payees; or
    (ii) The person, firm, or financial institution which made the 
marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment advances to the

prescribed by CCC, in original and two copies, numbered serially for 
each county office by the person, firm, or financial institution which 
made the marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment advance. 
The Transmittal shall show the amounts invested by the person, firm, or 
financial institution in the marketing assistance loans or loan 
deficiency payments.
    (3) Upon receipt of the marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency 
payment documents and Transmittal, the county office will stamp one copy 
of the Transmittal to indicate receipt of the documents and return this 
copy to the person, firm, or financial institution.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.16  Reconcentration of cotton.

    (a) CCC may under certain conditions, before loan maturity, 
compress, store, insure, or reinsure the cotton against any risk, or 
otherwise handle or deal with the cotton as it may deem necessary or 
appropriate for the purpose of protecting the interest therein of the 
producer or CCC.
    (b) CCC may reconcentrate the cotton pledged for the marketing 
assistance loan from one CCC-approved warehouse to another with the 
written consent of the producer and upon the request of the local 
warehouse and certification that there is congestion and lack of storage 
facilities in the area. However, if CCC determines such cotton is 
improperly warehoused and subject to damage, or if any of the terms of 
the loan agreement are violated, or if carrying charges are 
substantially in excess of the average of carrying charges available 
elsewhere and the local warehouse, after notice, declines to reduce such 
charges, such written consent need not be obtained.
    (1) An FSA official, the loan servicing agent, or CMA shall arrange 
for reconcentration of the cotton under the direction of CCC and CCC 
shall obtain new warehouse receipts.
    (2) Any reconcentration charges, fees, costs, or expenses incident 
to such actions shall be charged against the cotton, and must be repaid 
for bales redeemed from loan.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.17  Custodial offices.

    Collateral warehouse receipts, using forms prescribed by CCC, and 
related documents will be maintained in the custody of CCC, its 
designee, the loan servicing agent, or the cotton commercial bank, 
whichever disbursed the loan evidenced by such documents.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.18  Liability of the producer.

    (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in 
obtaining a marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment or in 
maintaining or settling a loan, or disposes of or moves the loan 
collateral without the prior written approval of CCC, such loan or loan 
deficiency payment shall be payable upon demand by CCC. The producer 
shall be liable for:
    (i) The amount of the marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency 
payment;
    (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC for the loan or loan 
deficiency payment;
    (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts;
    (v) Liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (vi) About amounts due for a loan, the payment of such amounts may 
not be satisfied by the forfeiture of loan collateral to CCC of cotton 
with a settlement value that is less than the total of such amounts or 
by repayment of such loan at the lower loan repayment rate as prescribed 
in Sec. 1427.19.
    (2) If a producer makes a fraudulent representation or if the 
producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without prior 
written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral delivered to or 
acquired by CCC shall be equal to the sales price of the cotton less any 
costs incurred by CCC in completing the sale.
    (b) If the amount disbursed under a marketing assistance loan, or in 
settlement thereof, or loan deficiency payment exceeds the amount 
authorized by this subpart, the producer shall be liable for repayment 
of such excess, plus interest. In addition, the commodity pledged as 
collateral for such loan shall not be released to the producer until 
such excess is repaid.
    (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment is less than the 
amount required under this subpart, the producer shall be personally 
liable for repayment of the amount of such deficiency plus applicable 
interest.
    (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
or loan deficiency payment application with CCC, each such producer 
shall be jointly and severally liable for the violation of the terms and 
conditions of the note and security agreement or loan deficiency payment 
application and this subpart. Each producer shall

[[Page 452]]

also remain liable for repayment of the entire loan or loan deficiency 
payment amount until the loan is fully repaid without regard to their 
share in the cotton pledged as collateral for the loan or for which the 
loan deficiency payment was made. In addition, such producer may not 
amend the note and security agreement or loan deficiency payment 
application for the producer's claimed share in such cotton after 
execution of the note and security agreement or loan deficiency payment 
application by CCC.
    (e) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC if a producer makes 
any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or loan deficiency 
payment or in maintaining or settling a loan or disposing of or moving 
the loan collateral without the prior written approval of CCC. 
Accordingly, if CCC determines that the producer has violated the terms 
or conditions of their requests for a loan or any applicable form 
required by CCC, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of 
the cotton which is involved in the violation. If CCC determines the 
producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the first offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than first or second offense, liquidated damages will be assessed 
by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 percent of 
the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the loan deficiency payment 
rate.
    (f) For first and second offenses, if CCC determines that a producer 
acted in good faith when the violation occurred, CCC shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal and charges, plus 
interest applicable to the loan quantity affected by the violation or 
for loan deficiency payment, the loan deficiency payment amount 
applicable to the loan deficiency quantity involved with the violation, 
and charges plus interest from the date the loan deficiency payment was 
made; and
    (2) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section;
    (3) If the producer fails to pay such amounts within 30 calendar 
days from the date of notification, CCC shall call the applicable 
marketing assistance loan involved in the violation and require 
repayment of any market gain previously realized for the applicable 
loan, plus any interest previously waived and any storage paid by CCC, 
or fora loan deficiency payment, require repayment of the loan 
deficiency payment and charges plus interest from the date the loan 
deficiency payment was made.
    (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense 
for which CCC cannot determine good faith when the violation occurred, 
CCC shall:
    (1) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; 
and
    (2) Call the applicable marketing assistance loan involved in the 
violation and require repayment of any market gain previously realized 
for the applicable loan, plus any interest previously waived and any 
storage paid by CCC, and for a loan deficiency payment, require 
repayment of the loan deficiency payment and charges plus interest from 
the date the loan deficiency payment was made.
    (h) If the county committee acting on behalf of CCC determines that 
the producer has committed a violation under paragraph (e) of this 
section, CCC shall notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances which caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken under paragraph (f) or (g) 
of this section.
    (i) If the marketing assistance loan is called under this section, 
the producer must repay the loan at principal and charges, plus interest 
and may not repay the loan at the lower of the loan

[[Page 453]]

repayment rate under Sec. 1427.19 or utilize the provisions of part 1401 
of this chapter for such loan.
    (j) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under paragraph 
(e) of this section may be waived as determined by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.24  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.25  Determination of the prevailing world market price and the adjusted world price for upland cotton.

    (a) CCC shall determine the world market price for upland cotton as 
follows:
    (1) During the period when only one daily price quotation is 
available for each growth quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-
second inch (M 1\3/32\ inch) cotton, C.I.F. (cost, insurance, and 
freight) northern Europe, the prevailing world market price for upland 
cotton shall be based upon the average of the quotations for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the 
growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe.
    (2) During the period when both a price quotation for cotton for 
shipment no later than August/September of the current calendar year 
(current shipment price) and a price quotation for cotton for shipment 
no earlier than October/November of the current calendar year (forward 
shipment price) are available for growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, the prevailing world market price for 
upland cotton shall be based upon the following: Beginning with the 
first week covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes 
April 15 or, if both the average of the current shipment prices for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the 
growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe 
(Northern Europe current price (NEc)), and the average of the forward 
shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 
lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, 
C.I.F. northern Europe (Northern Europe forward price (NEf)), are not 
available during that period, beginning with the first week covering the 
period Friday through Thursday after the week which includes April 15 in 
which both the NEc and NEf price are available, the prevailing world 
market price for upland cotton shall be based upon the result calculated 
by the following procedure:
    (i) Weeks 1 and 2: ((2 x NEc) + NEf)/3.
    (ii) Weeks 3 and 4: (NEc + NEf)/2.
    (iii) Weeks 5 and 6: (NEc + (2 x NEf))/3.
    (iv) Week 7 through July 31: NEf.
    (3) The upland cotton prevailing world market price as determined 
under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section shall hereinafter be 
referred to as the ``Northern Europe price (NE).''
    (4) If quotes are not available for 1 or more days in the 5-day 
period, the available quotes during the period will be used. If no 
quotes are available during the Friday through Thursday period, the 
prevailing world market price shall be based upon the best available 
world price information, as CCC determines.
    (b) The upland cotton prevailing world market price, adjusted under 
paragraph (c) of this section (adjusted world price (AWP)), shall be 
applicable to the 2002 through 2007 crops of upland cotton.
    (c) The upland cotton AWP shall equal the NE price as determined 
under paragraph (a) of this section, adjusted as follows:

[[Page 456]]

    (1) The NE shall be adjusted to average designated U.S. spot market 
location by deducting the average difference in the immediately 
preceding 52-week period between:
    (i)(A) The average of price quotations for the U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted each Thursday 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, during the period 
when only one daily price quotation for such growths is available, or
    (B) The average of the current shipment prices for U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted each Thursday 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, during the period 
when both current shipment prices and forward shipment prices for such 
growths are available; and
    (ii) The average price of M 1\3/32\ inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 
through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per 
tex, length uniformity 80 through 82 percent) cotton, as quoted each 
Thursday in the designated U.S. spot markets.
    (2) The price determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall be adjusted to reflect the price of Strict Low Middling (SLM) 1\1/
16\ inch, leaf 4, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, 
strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length uniformity 80 through 
82 percent) cotton (U.S. base quality) by deducting the difference, as 
CCC announces, between the applicable loan rate for an upland cotton 
crop for M 1\3/32\ inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 
through 4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length uniformity 
80 through 82 percent) cotton and the loan rate for an upland cotton 
crop of the U.S. base quality.
    (3) The price determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
shall be adjusted to average U.S. location by deducting the difference 
between the average loan rate for an upland cotton crop of the U.S. base 
quality in the designated U.S. spot markets and the corresponding crop 
year national average loan rate for an upland cotton crop of the U.S. 
base quality, as CCC announces.
    (4)(i) The prevailing world market price, adjusted under paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, may be further adjusted if it is 
determined that:
    (A) Such price is less than 115 percent of the current crop-year 
loan level for U.S. base quality cotton, and
    (B) The Friday through Thursday average price quotation for the 
lowest-priced U.S. growth as quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. 
northern Europe (U.S. Northern Europe price (USNE)), is greater than the 
average of the quotations for the preceding Friday through Thursday for 
the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe.
    (ii) During the period when both current shipment prices and forward 
shipment prices are available for growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, the USNE provided in paragraph 
(c)(4)(i)(B) of this section shall be determined as follows: Beginning 
with the week covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes 
April 15 or, if both the average of the current shipment prices for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday of the lowest-priced U.S. growth, as 
quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe (U.S. Northern 
Europe current price (USNEc)), and the average of the forward shipment 
prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday of the lowest-priced 
United States growth quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern 
Europe (U.S. Northern Europe forward price (USNEf)), are not available 
during that period, beginning with the first week covering the period 
Friday through Thursday after the week which including April 15 in which 
both the average of the USNEc and the average of the USNEf are 
available, the result calculated by the following procedure:
    (A) Weeks 1 and 2: ((2 x USNEc) + (USNEf))/3.
    (B) Weeks 3 and 4: ((USNEc) + (USNEf))/2.
    (C) Weeks 5 and 6: ((USNEc) + (2 x USNEf))/3.
    (D) Week 7 through July 31: USNEf.
    (iii) In determining the USNE as provided in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(B) 
and (c)(4)(ii):
    (A) If quotes for either the U.S. Memphis territory or the 
California/Arizona

[[Page 457]]

territory are not available for any week, the available quotations will 
be used.
    (B) If quotes are not available for one or more days in the 5-day 
period, the available quotes during the period will be used.
    (C) If no quotes are available for either the U.S. Memphis territory 
or the California/Arizona territory during the Friday through Thursday 
period, no adjustment will be made.
    (iv)(A) The adjustment shall be based on some or all of the 
following data, as available:
    (1) The U.S. share of world exports;
    (2) The current level of cotton export sales and shipments; and
    (3) Other data CCC determines relevant in establishing an accurate 
prevailing world market price, adjusted to U.S. quality and location.
    (B) The adjustment may not exceed the difference between the USNE, 
as determined in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section, and the NE, as determined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) In determining the average difference in the 52-week period as 
provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
    (1) If the difference between the average price quotations for the 
U.S. Memphis territory and the California/Arizona territory, as quoted 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, and the average price 
of M 1\3/32\ inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 
4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length uniformity 80 
through 82 percent) cotton as quoted each Thursday in the designated 
U.S. spot markets for any week is:
    (i) More than 115 percent of the estimated actual cost associated 
with transporting U.S. cotton to northern Europe, then 115 percent of 
such actual cost shall be substituted in lieu thereof for such week.
    (ii) Less than 85 percent of the estimated actual cost associated 
with transporting U.S. cotton to northern Europe, then 85 percent of 
such actual cost shall be substituted in lieu thereof for such week.
    (2) If a Thursday price quotation for either the U.S. Memphis 
territory or the California/Arizona territory, as quoted for M 1\3/32\ 
inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, is not available for any week, CCC:
    (i) May use the available northern Europe quotation to determine the 
difference between the average price quotations for the U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory, as quoted for M 1\3/32\ 
inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, and the average price of M 1\3/32\ 
inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 
25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length uniformity 80 through 82 
percent) cotton, as quoted each Thursday in the designated U.S. spot 
markets for that week, or
    (ii) May not take that week into consideration.
    (3) If Thursday price quotations for any week are not available for 
either,
    (i) Both the Memphis territory and the California/Arizona territory 
as quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, or
    (ii) The average price of M 1\3/32\ inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 
through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per 
tex, length uniformity 80 through 82 percent) cotton, as quoted in the 
designated U.S. spot markets, that week will not be considered.
    (e) The upland cotton AWP, determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section, and the amount of the additional adjustment determined under 
paragraph (f) of this section, shall be announced, to the extent 
practicable, at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard time each Thursday continuing 
through the last Thursday of July, 2008. In the event that Thursday is a 
non-workday, the determination will be announced, to the extent 
practicable, at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard time the next work day.
    (f)(1)(i) The AWP, as determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section, shall be subject to further adjustments as provided in this 
section regarding all qualities of upland cotton eligible for loan 
except the following upland cotton grades with a staple length of 1\1/
16\ inch or longer:
    (A) White Grades--Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 6;

    (ii) Grade and staple length must be determined under Sec. 1427.9. 
If no such official classification is presented, the coarse count 
adjustment shall not be made.
    (2) The adjustment for upland cotton provided under paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section shall be determined by deducting from the AWP:
    (i) The difference between the NE, and
    (A) During the period when only one daily price quotation for each 
growth quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, is 
available the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday 
through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths 
quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe; or
    (B) During the period when both current shipment prices and forward 
shipment prices are available for the growths quoted for ``coarse 
count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, the result calculated by the 
following procedure: Beginning with the first week covering the period 
Friday through Thursday including April 15 or, if both the average of 
the current shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday 
for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for ``coarse 
count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe (Northern Europe coarse count 
current price (NECCc)), and the average of the forward shipment prices 
for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced

cotton crop for SLM 1\1/16\ inch, leaf 4, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 
and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length 
uniformity 80 through 82 percent) cotton.
    (iii) The result of the calculation as determined under this 
paragraph shall hereinafter be referred to as the ``Northern Europe 
coarse count price.''
    (3) Regarding the determination of the Northern Europe coarse count 
price under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section:
    (i) If no quotes are available for one or more days of the 5-day 
period, the available quotes will be used;
    (ii) If quotes for three growths are not available for any day in 
the 5-day period, that day will not be considered; and
    (iii) If quotes for three growths are not available for at least 3 
days in the 5-day period, that week will not be considered, in which 
case the adjustment determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
for the latest available week will continue to be applicable.
    (g) If the 6-week transition period from using current shipment 
prices to using forward shipment prices in the determination of the NE 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Northern Europe coarse 
count price under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section do not begin at 
the same time, CCC shall use either current shipment prices, forward 
shipment prices, or any combination thereof to determine the NE and/or 
the Northern Europe coarse count price used in the determination of the 
adjustment for upland cotton under paragraph (f)(1) of this section and 
determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to prevent distortions 
in such adjustment.

[[Page 459]]

    (h) The AWP determined under paragraph (c) of this section, shall be 
subject to further adjustments to a value no less than zero, as CCC 
determines, based upon the Schedule of Premiums and Discounts and the 
location differentials applicable to each warehouse location as 
announced under the loan program for an upland cotton crop.

available for each growth quoted for M 1\3/32\-inch cotton, delivered 
cost insurance, and freight (C.I.F.) northern Europe, or the USNEc and 
the NEc, or the USNEf and the NEf. In that case, CCC may establish a 
payment rate at a level it determines to be appropriate, taking into 
consideration the payment rate determined under paragraph (a) of this 
section for the most recent available week; and
    (iii) Beginning July 18, 1996, if no daily quotes are available for 
the entire 5-day period for either or both the USNEc and the NEc, the 
marketing year transition shall be implemented immediately.
    (2) Regarding the determination of the USNE, the USNEc, and the 
USNEf, if a quotation for either the U.S. Memphis territory or the 
California/Arizona territory, as quoted for M 1\3/32\-inch cotton, 
delivered C.I.F. northern Europe, is not available for each day or any 
day of the 5-day period, available quotation(s) will be used.
    (d) Payment rates for semi-processed motes that are of a quality 
suitable, without further processing, for spinning, papermaking or 
bleaching shall be based on a percentage of the basic rate for baled

    (2) The net weight (gross weight minus the weight of bagging and 
ties),

[[Page 462]]

determined under paragraph (b) of this section, of eligible upland 
cotton bales an eligible domestic user opens or an eligible exporter 
sold for export during the Friday through Thursday period following a 
week in which a payment rate is established.
    (b) For the purposes of this subpart, the net weight shall be 
determined based upon:
    (1) For domestic users, the weight on which settlement for payment 
of the cotton was based (landed mill weight);
    (2) For reginned motes processed by an end user who converted such 
motes, without rebaling, to an end use in a continuous manufacturing 
process, the net weight of the reginned motes after final cleaning;
    (3) For exporters, the shipping warehouse weight or the gin weight 
if the cotton was not placed in a warehouse, of the eligible cotton 
unless the exporter obtains and pays the cost of having all the bales in 
the shipment reweighed by a licensed weigher and furnishes a copy of the 
certified reweights.
    (c) For the purposes of this subpart, eligible upland cotton will be 
considered--
    (1) Consumed by the domestic user on the date the bale is opened for 
consumption; and
    (2) Exported by the exporter on the date CCC determines is the date 
on which the cotton is shipped through July 31, 2008.
    (d) Payments under this subpart shall be made available upon 
application for payment and submission of supporting documentation, 
including proof of purchase and consumption of eligible cotton by the 
domestic user or proof of export of eligible cotton by the exporter, as 
required by the CCC-issued provisions of the Upland Cotton Domestic 
User/Exporter Agreement.

for loan shall be determined by the county office by multiplying the 
weight or estimated weight of seed cotton by the lint turnout factor 
determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The lint turnout factor for any lot of seed cotton shall be the 
percentage determined by the county committee representative during the 
initial inspection of the lot. If a control portion of the lot is 
weighed and ginned, the turnout factor determined for the portion of 
cotton ginned will be used for the lot. If a control portion is not 
weighed and ginned, the lint turnout factor shall not exceed 32 percent

Sec. 1427.171  Approved storage.

    Approved storage shall consist of storage located on or off the 
producer's farm (excluding public warehouses) which is determined by a 
county committee representative to afford adequate protection against 
loss or damage and which is located within a reasonable distance, as 
determined by CCC, from an approved gin. If the cotton is not stored on 
the producer's farm, the producer must furnish satisfactory evidence 
that the producer has the authority to store the cotton on such property 
and that the owner of such property has no lien for such storage against 
the cotton. The producer must provide satisfactory evidence that the 
producer and any person having an interest in the cotton including CCC, 
have the right to enter the premises to inspect and examine the cotton 
and shall permit a reasonable time to such persons to remove the cotton 
from the premises.

[[Page 465]]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.172  Settlement.

    (a) A producer may, at any time before maturity of the loan, obtain 
release of all or any part of the loan seed cotton by paying to CCC the 
amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.
    (b)(1) A producer or the producer's agent shall not remove from 
storage any cotton which is pledged as collateral for a loan until prior 
written approval has been received from CCC for removal of such cotton. 
If a producer or the producer's agent obtains such approval, they may 
remove such cotton from storage, sell the seed cotton, have it ginned, 
and sell the lint cotton and cottonseed obtained therefrom. The ginner 
shall inform the county office in writing immediately after the seed 
cotton removed from storage has been ginned and furnish the county 
office the loan number, producer's name, and applicable gin bale 
numbers. If the seed cotton is removed from storage, the loan principal 
plus interest and charges thereon must be satisfied not later than the 
earlier of:
    (i) The date established by the county committee;
    (ii) 5 days after the date of the producer received the AMS 
classification under Sec. 1427.9 (and the warehouse receipt, if the 
cotton is delivered to a warehouse), representing such cotton; or
    (iii) The loan maturity date.
    (2) If the seed cotton or lint cotton is sold, the loan principal, 
interest, and charges must be satisfied immediately.
    (3) A producer, except a CMA, may obtain a nonrecourse loan or loan 
deficiency payment under subpart A of this part, on the lint cotton, 
but:
    (i) The loan principal, interest, and charges on the seed cotton 
must be satisfied from the proceeds of the nonrecourse loan under 
subpart A of this part; or
    (ii) The loan deficiency payment must be applied to the loan 
principal, interest, and charges on the outstanding seed cotton loan.
    (4) A CMA must repay the seed cotton loan principal, interest, and 
charges before pledging the cotton for a nonrecourse loan or before a 
loan deficiency payment can be approved under subpart A of this part, on 
the lint cotton. If CMA's authorized by producers to obtain loans in 
their behalf remove seed cotton from storage before obtaining approval 
to move such cotton, such removal shall constitute conversion of such 
cotton unless the CMA:
    (i) Notifies the county office in writing the following morning by 
mail or otherwise that such cotton has been moved and is on the gin 
yard;
    (ii) Furnishes CCC an irrevocable letter of credit if requested; and
    (iii) Repays the loan principal, plus interest and charges, within 
the time specified by the county committee.
    (5) Any removal from storage shall not be deemed to constitute a 
release of CCC's security interest in the seed cotton or to release the 
producer or CMA from liability for the loan principal, interest, and 
charges if full payment of such amount is not received by the county 
office.
    (c) If, either before or after maturity, the producer discovers that 
the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of 
condition, the producer shall immediately notify the county office and 
confirm such notice in writing. If the county committee determines that 
the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of 
condition, the county committee will call for repayment of the loan 
principal, plus interest and charges on or before a specified date. If 
the producer does not repay the loan or have the cotton ginned and 
obtain a nonrecourse loan under subpart A of this part on the lint 
cotton produced therefrom within the period as specified by the county 
committee, the cotton shall be considered abandoned.
    (d) If the producer has control of the storage site and if the 
producer subsequently loses control of the storage site or there is 
danger of flood or damage to the seed cotton or storage structure making 
continued storage of the cotton unsafe, the producer shall immediately 
either repay the loan or move the seed cotton to the nearest approved 
gin for ginning and shall, at the same time, inform the county office. 
If the producer does not do so, the seed cotton shall be considered 
abandoned.

Sec. 1427.173  Foreclosure.

    Any seed cotton pledged as collateral for a loan which is abandoned 
or which has not been ginned and pledged as collateral for a nonrecourse 
loan under subpart A of this part by the seed cotton loan maturity date 
may be removed from storage by CCC and ginned and the resulting lint 
cotton warehoused for the account of CCC. The lint cotton and cottonseed 
may be sold, at such time, in such manner, and upon such terms as CCC 
may determine, at public or private sale. CCC may become the purchaser 
of the whole or any part of such cotton and cottonseed. If the proceeds 
received from the sales of the cotton are less than the amount due on 
the loan (including principal, interest, ginning charges, and any other 
charges incurred by CCC), the producer shall be liable for such 
difference. If the proceeds received from sale of the cotton are greater 
than the sum of the amount due plus any cost incurred by CCC in 
conducting the sale of the cotton, the amount of such excess shall be 
paid to the producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of the 
producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.174  Maturity of seed cotton loans.

    Seed cotton loans mature on demand by CCC but no later than May 31 
following the calendar year in which such crop is normally harvested.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.175  Liability of the producer.

    (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in 
obtaining a loan, maintaining a loan, or settling a loan or if the 
producer disposes of or moves the loan collateral without the prior 
approval of CCC, such loan amount shall be refunded upon demand by CCC. 
The producer shall be liable for:
    (i) The amount of the loan;
    (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC for the loan;
    (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts; and
    (v) Liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding any provision of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent representation or 
if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without 
prior written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral acquired 
by CCC shall be equal to the sales price of the cotton less any costs 
incurred by CCC in completing the sale.
    (b) If the amount disbursed under a loan, or in settlement thereof, 
exceeds the amount authorized by this subpart, the producer shall be 
liable for repayment of such excess, plus interest. In addition, seed 
cotton pledged as collateral for such loan shall not be released to the 
producer until such excess is repaid.
    (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan is less than the amount required under this subpart, the producer 
shall be personally liable for repayment of the amount of such 
deficiency plus applicable interest.
    (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
with CCC, each such producer shall be jointly and severally liable for 
the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security 
agreement and the regulations in this subpart. Each such producer shall 
also remain liable for repayment of the entire loan amount until the 
loan is fully repaid without regard to such producer's claimed share in 
the seed cotton pledged as collateral for the loan. In addition, such 
producer may not amend the note and security agreement for the 
producer's claimed share in such seed cotton, after execution of the 
note and security agreement by CCC.
    (e) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC if a producer makes 
any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or in maintaining or 
settling a loan or disposing of or moving the collateral without the 
prior approval of CCC. Accordingly, if CCC or the county committee 
determines that the producer has violated the terms or conditions of the 
note and security agreement, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the 
quantity of the seed cotton which

[[Page 467]]

is involved in the violation. If CCC or the county committee determines 
the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
first offense;
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than first or second offense, liquidated damages will be assessed 
by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 percent of 
the loan rate applicable to the loan note.
    (f) For first and second offenses, if CCC or the county committee 
determines that a producer acted in good faith when the violation 
occurred, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan 
quantity affected by the violation, and charges plus interest applicable 
to the amount repaid;
    (2) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; 
and
    (3) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days 
from the date of notification, call the applicable loan involved in the 
violation.
    (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense 
for which CCC or the county committee cannot determine good faith when 
the violation occurred, the county committee shall:
    (1) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section;
    (2) Call the applicable loan involved in the violation.
    (h) If CCC or the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation under paragraph (e) of this section, the county 
committee shall notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information to the county committee regarding the circumstances which 
caused the violation, and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken under paragraphs (f) or (g) 
of this section.
    (i) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under the 
provision of paragraph (e) of this section may be waived as determined 
by CCC.

 Subpart E--Standards for Approval of Warehouses for Cotton and Cotton 
                                 Linters

    Authority: Secs. 4 and 5, 62 Stat. 1070, as amended, 1072, as 
amended (15 U.S.C. 714 b and c).

    Source: 44 FR 67085, Nov. 23, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1081  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the approval by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of warehouse(s) for the 
storage and handling of cotton and cotton linters, under a Cotton 
Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or held by CCC as security for 
price support loans. This subpart is not applicable to cotton or cotton 
linters purchased in storage for prompt shipment or to handling 
operations of a temporary nature.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by the KCCO and a storage agreement 
must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC will use 
such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering into of a 
storage agreement does not constitute a commitment that CCC will use the 
warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman, when applying for approval under this subpart 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:

[[Page 468]]

    (1) A completed Form CCC-49, ``Application for Approval of Warehouse 
for Storage of Cotton and/or Cotton Linters,''
    (2) A current financial statement on Form WA-51, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee. 
Financial statements shall show the financial condition of the 
warehouseman as of a date no earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the 
date of the warehouseman's application, or such other date as CCC may 
prescribe. Additional financial statements shall be furnished annually 
and at such other times as CCC may require. CCC also may require that 
financial statements prepared by the warehouseman or by a public 
accountant be examined by an independent certified public accountant in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Only one 
financial statement is required for a chain of warehouses owned or 
operated by a single business entity. If approved by the Director, KCCO, 
or the Director's designee, the financial statement of a parent company, 
which includes the financial position of a wholly-owned subsidiary, may 
be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for the wholly-owned 
subsidiary.
    (3) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1427.1082(a)(2) and such 
other documents or information as CCC may require,
    (4) For warehouseman not operating under the U.S. Warehouse Act, a 
sample copy of the warehouseman's receipts and bale tags, and
    (5) Evidence of applicable fire insurance rates.

CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC-owned or -loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for

which results from multiplying the maximum storage capacity of the 
warehouse (the total number of bales of cotton or cotton linters which 
the warehouse can accommodate when stored in the customary manner) times 
ten (10) dollars per bale. The net worth need not exceed $250,000. If 
the calculated net worth exceeds $25,000, the warehouseman may satisfy 
any deficiency in net worth between the $25,000 minimum requirement and 
such calculated net worth by furnishing bond (or acceptable substitute 
security) meeting the requirements of Sec. 1427.1083,
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating 
expenses,
    (5) Have satisfactorily corrected, upon request by CCC, any 
deficiencies in the performance of any storage agreement with CCC,
    (6) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,
    (7) Use only card type warehouse receipts which are pre-numbered and 
pre-punched or such other document as CCC may prescribe,
    (8) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable 
firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored 
commodity, and
    (9) Have a work force and equipment available to provide adequate 
storage and handling service.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the

business regarding the applicable commodities to enable them to provide 
proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials and each of the supervisory employees of 
the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operation shall:
    (1) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and 
performance, and
    (2) Be neither suspended nor debarred under applicable CCC 
suspension and debarment regulations.

adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the 
applicable commodity,
    (2) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all 
times, and
    (3) Not be subject to greater than normal risk of fire, flood, or 
other hazards.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1083  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process and in the State where the warehouse is 
located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC.
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than ninety (90) days or 
includes a rider providing for not less than ninety (90) days' notice to 
CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a substitute bond for one 
warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC against insufficient 
bond coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1084  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage and handling of the commodity and periodically 
thereafter to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1085  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this report:
    (a) The financial bond and original and periodic warehouse 
examination

[[Page 470]]

provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman approved or 
applying for approval for the storage and handling of cotton or cotton 
linters under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under the U.S. 
Warehouse Act for such commodity but a special examination shall be made 
of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $25,000 but who 
fails, or whose warehouse fails, to meet one or more of the other 
standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity,
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

[44 FR 67085, Nov. 23, 1979, as amended by Amdt. 3, 50 FR 16455, Apr.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1086  Approval of warehouse, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart, and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. This notice will state the cause(s) for such action. 
Unless the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1427.1082, other than the standard set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after 
receiving notice of such action, request reconsideration of the action 
and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of 
such request. The Director shall consider such information in making a 
determination of notify the warehouseman in writing of such 
determination. The warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's 
determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal 
hearing thereon by filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as 
``FSA''). The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, 
nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the 
hearing shall be as prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 
7 CFR part 780. When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman 
shall be considered as a ``participant''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1427.1082(c)(2), the warehouseman's administrative 
appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in 
accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period 
of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1087  Exemption from requirements.

    (a) If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of this subpart and no reasonable and economical alternative 
is available for securing such services for commodities under CCC 
programs, the President or Executive Vice President, CCC may exempt, in 
writing, applicants in such area from one or more of the standards of 
this subpart and may establish such other standards as are considered 
necessary to safeguard satisfactorily the interests of CCC.

[[Page 471]]

    (b) Warehousemen who are currently under contract with CCC will be 
required to meet the terms and conditions of these regulations at the 
time of renewal of their contract.

    (a) Each warehouseman who has a non-federally licensed cotton 
warehouse must pay an annual contract fee for each such warehouse for 
which the warehouseman requests renewal of an existing Cotton Storage 
Agreement or approval of a new Cotton Storage Agreement as follows:
    (1) A warehouseman who has an existing Cotton Storage Agreement with 
CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or cotton pledged 
to CCC as loan collateral must pay an annual contract fee for each 
warehouse approved under such agreement in advance of the renewal date 
of such agreement.
    (2) A warehouseman who does not have an existing Cotton Storage 
Agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or 
cotton pledged to CCC as loan collateral but who desires such an 
agreement must pay a contract fee for each warehouse for which CCC 
approval is sought prior to the time that the agreement is approved by 
CCC.
    (b) The amount of the contract fee shall be determined and announced 
annually in the Federal Register.

Sec. 1427.1200  Applicability.

    (a) These regulations set forth the terms and conditions under which 
CCC shall make payments, in the form of commodity certificates or cash, 
to eligible domestic users and exporters of extra long staple (ELS) 
cotton who have entered into an ELS Cotton Domestic User/Exporter 
Agreement with CCC to participate in the ELS cotton competitiveness

Sec. 1427.1201  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1202  Definitions.

    Consumption means, the use of eligible ELS cotton by a domestic user 
in the manufacture in the United States of ELS cotton products.
    Cotton product means any product containing cotton fibers that 
result from the use of an eligible bale of ELS cotton in manufacturing.
    Current shipment price means, during the period in which two daily 
price quotations are available for the LFQ for the foreign growth, 
quoted C.I.F. northern Europe, the price quotation for cotton for 
shipment no later than August/September of the current calendar year.
    Forward shipment price means, during the period in which two daily 
price quotations are available for the LFQ for foreign growths, quoted 
C.I.F. northern Europe, the price quotation for cotton for shipment no 
earlier than October/November of the current calendar year.
    LFQ means, during the period in which only one daily price quotation 
is available for the growth, the lowest average for the preceding Friday 
through Thursday week of the price quotations for foreign growths of ELS 
cotton, quoted cost, insurance, and freight C.I.F. northern Europe, 
after each respective average is adjusted for quality differences 
between the respective foreign growth and U.S. Pima, of the base 
quality, provided that the lowest adjusted quotation becomes the LFQ 
after it is further adjusted to reflect the estimated cost of 
transportation between an average U.S. location and northern Europe.
    (1) Current LFQ means the preceding Friday through Thursday average 
of the current shipment prices for the lowest adjusted foreign growth, 
C.I.F. northern Europe.

Valley and Desert Southwest spot quotations are available, the U.S. 
quotation will be a weighted average of the two quotations, as 
determined by the Secretary. If only one quotation is available, that 
quotation will be used.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1207  Payment rate.

    (a) The payment rate for payments made under this subpart shall be 
determined as follows:
    (1) Beginning the Thursday following August 1 and ending the week in 
which the current LFQ and the forward LFQ may first become available, 
the payment rate shall be the difference between the U.S. Pima spot 
price and the LFQ in the fourth week of a consecutive 4-week period in 
which the U.S. Pima spot price exceeded the LFQ each week, and the LFQ 
was less than 134 percent of the current crop year loan level for U.S. 
base quality Pima cotton in all weeks of the 4-week period; and
    (2) Beginning the Friday through Thursday week after the week in 
which the current LFQ and the forward LFQ may first become available and 
ending the Thursday following July 31, the payment rate shall be the 
difference between the U.S. Pima spot price and the current LFQ in the 
fourth week of a consecutive 4-week period in which the U.S. Pima spot 
price exceeded the current LFQ each week, and the current LFQ was less 
than 134 percent of the current crop year loan level for base quality 
U.S. Pima in all weeks of the 4-week period. If the current LFQ is not 
available, the payment rate may be the difference between the U.S. Pima 
spot price and the forward LFQ.
    (b) Whenever a 4-week period under paragraph (a) of this section 
contains a combination of LFQ, current LFQ and forward LFQ for only one 
to three weeks, such as may occur in the spring when the LFQ price is 
succeeded by the current LFQ and the forward LFQ (Spring transition) and 
at the start of a new marketing year when the current LFQ and the 
forward LFQ are succeeded by the LFQ (marketing year transition), under 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, during both the spring 
transition and the marketing year transition periods, to the extent 
practicable, the current LFQ in combination with the LFQ shall be 
considered during such 4-week periods to determine whether a payment is 
to be issued. During both the spring transition and the marketing year 
transition periods, if the current LFQ is not available, the forward LFQ 
in combination with the LFQ shall be taken into consideration during 
such 4-week periods to determine whether a payment is to be issued.
    (c) For purposes of this subpart, regarding the determination of the 
U.S. Pima spot price, the LFQ, the current LFQ and the forward LFQ:
    (1) If daily quotations are not available for one or more days of 
the 5-day period, the available quotations during the period will be 
used;
    (2) If the U.S. Pima spot price is not available or if none of the 
LFQ, current LFQ or forward LFQ is available, the

[[Page 474]]

payment rate shall be zero and shall remain zero unless and until 
sufficient U.S. Pima spot prices and/or LFQ again become available, the 
U.S. Pima spot price exceeds the LFQ, the current LFQ or the forward 
LFQ, as the case may be, and the LFQ, the current LFQ, or the forward 
LFQ, as the case may be, is less than 134 percent of the current crop 
year loan rate for base quality U.S. Pima for 4 consecutive weeks.
    (d) Payment rates for loose, reginned motes and semi-processed motes 
that are of a quality suitable, without further processing, for 
spinning, papermaking or bleaching shall be based on a percentage of the 
basic rate for baled lint, as specified in the ELS Cotton Domestic User/
Exporter Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1208  Payment.

    (a) Payments under this subpart shall be determined by multiplying:
    (1) The payment rate, determined under Sec. 1427.127, by
    (2) The net weight (gross weight minus the weight of bagging and 
ties) determined under paragraph (b) of this section, of eligible ELS 
cotton bales that an eligible domestic user opens or an eligible 
exporter exports during the Friday through Thursday period following a 
week in which a payment rate is established.
    (b) For the purposes of this subpart, the net weight shall be based 
upon:
    (1) For domestic users, the weight on which settlement for payment 
of the ELS cotton was based (landed mill weight);
    (2) For reginned motes processed by an end user who converted such 
motes, without rebaling, to an end use in a continuous manufacturing 
process, the net weight of the reginned motes after final cleaning;
    (3) For exporters, the shipping warehouse weight or the gin weight 
if the ELS cotton was not placed in a warehouse, of the eligible cotton 
unless the exporter obtains and pays the cost of having all the bales in 
the shipment reweighed by a licensed weigher and furnishes a copy of the 
certified reweights.
    (c) For the purposes of this subpart, eligible ELS cotton will be 
considered:
    (1) Consumed by the domestic user on the date the bale is opened for 
consumption; and
    (2) Exported by the exporter on the date that CCC determines is the 
date on which the cotton is shipped for export.
    (d) Payments under this subpart shall be made available upon 
application for payment and submission of supporting documentation, as 
required by the CCC-issued provisions of the ELS Cotton Domestic User/
Exporter Agreement.

    (2) Dairy operations that desire payments to begin with the first 
month of the fiscal year will receive payments made by CCC consecutively 
on a monthly basis until the earlier of the following:
    (i) The maximum payment quantity is reached as determined in 
accordance with Sec. 1430.207; or
    (ii) The end of the applicable fiscal year.
    (e) All producers involved in the dairy operation must agree to the

ending on the last day of the month preceding the month the operation's 
MILC is executed.
    (b) Transition payments are subject to the following:
    (1) The maximum payment quantity on eligible production, as 
described in Sec. 1430.207;

in accordance with Sec. 1430.207; or
    (ii) The end of the applicable fiscal year.
    (c) With respect to the 2002 Fiscal Year, the dairy operation may 
elect to forgo their transition payment and choose to begin receiving 
payments in September, 2002 in accordance with Sec. 1430.205.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this subpart, dairy 
operations that go out of business after December 1, 2001, may enter 
into a MILC with CCC for a transition payment on the quantity of 
eligible production marketed by the dairy operation during the 
transition period while the dairy operation was in business.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.207  Dairy operation payment quantity.

    (a) The applicant's payment quantity of milk will be determined by 
CCC, based on the quantity of milk that was produced and commercially 
marketed by each dairy operation per fiscal year.
    (b) The maximum quantity of eligible production for which dairy 
operations are eligible for payment per any fiscal year, including any 
in the transition year, under this subpart shall be 2.4 million pounds 
(24,000 cwt.) per separate and distinct operation. In accordance with 
these regulations, the Deputy Administrator shall determine what is a 
separate and distinct operation and that decision shall be final.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.208  Payment rate and dairy operation payment.

    (a) Payments under this subpart may be made to dairy operations when 
the Boston Class I milk price under the applicable Federal milk 
marketing order is below $16.94 per cwt. No payments will be made to 
dairy operations for marketings during the months that the Boston Class 
I milk price under the applicable milk marketing order exceeds $16.94.

[[Page 479]]

    (b) A per-hundredweight payment rate will be determined for the 
applicable month by:
    (1) Subtracting from $16.94 the Class I milk price per cwt in 
Boston; and
    (2) Multiplying the difference, if positive, by 45 percent.
    (c) Each eligible dairy operation payment will be calculated, as 
determined by the Secretary, by:
    (1) Converting whole pounds of milk to hundredweight; and
    (2) Multiplying the payment rate determined in paragraph (b) of this 
section by the quantity of eligible production marketed by the operation 
during the applicable month as determined according to Sec. 1430.205 and 
other provisions of these regulations.
    (d) Payments under this subpart may be made to a dairy operation 
only up to the first 2.4 million pounds of eligible milk production per 
applicable fiscal year, including any year in the transition period.
    (e) Dairy operations receiving benefits under this subpart, will 
receive payments on a monthly basis according to the MILC, to the extent 
practicable, not later than 60 days after the production evidence and 
all supporting documents for the applicable month are received by CCC. 
Payments issued by CCC later than 60 days after all production evidence 
and supporting documentation are received by CCC will be subject to 
prompt payment interest as allowed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.209  Proof of marketings.

    (a) A dairy operation entering into an MILC must, based on 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide adequate proof 
of the dairy operation's eligible production during the months of each 
fiscal year designated in the MILC. The dairy operation must also 
provide proof that the eligible production was commercially marketed 
during the months beginning December 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 
2005. Evidence of milk production claimed for payment shall be provided 
to CCC with supporting documentation under paragraph (b) of this 
section. All information provided is subject to verification, spot 
check, and audit by FSA. Further verification information may be 
obtained from the dairy operation's milk handler or marketing 
cooperative if deemed necessary by CCC to verify provided information. 
Refusal to allow FSA or any other agency of the Department of 
Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a 
determination of ineligibility for benefits under this subpart.
    (b) Eligible dairy operations marketing milk during the period 
specified in the MILC shall provide any available supporting documents 
from all producers in the dairy operation to assist CCC in verifying 
that the dairy operation produced and marketed milk commercially from 
the designated starting month and thereafter. Examples of supporting 
documentation include, but are not limited to: milk marketing payment 
stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies 
of any payments received as compensation from other sources, or any 
other documents available to confirm the production and production 
history of the dairy operation. Producers may also be required to allow 
CCC to examine the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting 
documentation requested is not presented to CCC or FSA, the request for 
MILC benefits will be disapproved.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.210  MILC agents.

    (a) MILC benefits may be disbursed by a dairy marketing cooperative 
that serves special groups or communities, such as an Amish or Mennonite 
community. Producers in such groups in a dairy operation may authorize 
an agent of a dairy cooperative or milk handler affiliated with such 
cooperative to obtain and disburse MILC benefits to the dairy operation.

restructure such that the constitution or makeup of their operation is 
reconstituted in another organizational framework. However, any 
operation that changes after December 1, 2001, is subject to a review by 
FSA to determine if the operation was reorganized for the sole purpose 
of receiving multiple payments.

receive additional MILC payments will be in violation of its contract 
and dealt in accordance with Sec. 1430.214.
    (c) If during the contract period a change in the dairy operation 
occurs, the modification to the MILC will not take effect until the 
first day of the fiscal year following the month FSA received

producer affiliated with a dairy operation that has an approved MILC 
with CCC forming a new dairy operation that is not formed solely to 
receive additional MILC payments.
    (d) Changes resulting in the following will take effect immediately 
upon notification to CCC, in accordance with Sec. 1430.212:

not affiliated with an existing dairy operation that has an approved 
MILC with CCC.

Sec. 1430.214  Violations.

    (a) If producers in a dairy operation violates the MILC or the 
requirements of this subpart, CCC may:
    (1) Terminate the MILC for the remainder of the fiscal year in which 
the violation occurs, and allow the producer to retain any payments 
received under the contract; or

repay a portion of the payments received commensurate with the 
violation's severity, as CCC determines.
    (3) If the MILC is terminated under this section, the participant 
shall forfeit all rights to further MILC benefits and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received as CCC determines appropriate.
    (4) A producer or operation with a violation, as determined by CCC, 
shall refund all MILC funds disbursed under of this part. The remedies 
provided in this subpart shall be in addition to other civil, criminal,

    (1) Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the MILC and 
addendum;

Service Agency may terminate any MILC by mutual agreement upon request 
of the participant if DAFP determines that termination is in the best 
interest of the public.
    (d) The DAFP may determine that failure of the dairy operation to 
perform the MILC does not warrant termination and may require the 
participant to refund part of the payments received or accept 
adjustments in the payment as the DAFP determines to be appropriate.

the payment rate determined in paragraph (a) (3) of this section by the 
dairy operation's eligible production.

operation if CCC determines that payments or other assistance were 
provided to the producer was not eligible for such assistance. Such 
interest shall be charged at the rate of interest which the United 
States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date CCC made such 
benefits available. Such interest shall accrue from the date such 
benefits were made available to the date of repayment or the date 
interest increases as determined in accordance with applicable 
regulations. CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC determines

[[Page 486]]

that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any action 
of the dairy operation.
    (d) Interest determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section may be waived by CCC with respect to refunds required of the 
dairy operation because of unintentional misaction on the part of the 
dairy operation, as determined by CCC.

payment as of the date producers marketed or otherwise lost beneficial 
interest in the honey, as determined by the Secretary.
    (c) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the honey if the producer retains control, title, 
and risk of loss in the honey including the right to make all decisions 
regarding the tender of such honey to CCC for a loan, and the producer:
    (1) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, with respect to such 
honey if all other eligibility requirements are met and the option to 
purchase contains the following provision:

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the honey, as specified 
in 7 CFR part 1434, shall remain with the producer until the buyer 
exercises this option to purchase the honey. This option to purchase 
shall expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either the 
producer or the buyer, at the earlier of: (1) The maturity of any CCC 
loan which is secured by such honey; (2) the date the CCC claims title 
to such honey; or (3) such other date as provided in this option.''


or:

    (2) Enters into a contract to sell the honey if the producer retains

purchaser does not pay to the producer any advance payment amount or any 
incentive payment amount to enter into such contract except as provided 
in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (d) If loans are made available to producers through an approved CMA 
in accordance with part 1425 of this chapter, the beneficial interest in 
the honey must always have been in the producer-member who delivered the 
honey to the CMA or its member CMA's, except as otherwise provided in 
this section. Honey delivered to such a CMA shall not be eligible for 
loans if the producer-member who delivered the honey does not retain the 
right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of the honey as 
provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (e) A producer may, before the final date for obtaining a loan for 
honey, re-offer as loan honey any honey that has been previously pledged 
if the loan was repaid with principal plus interest, the loan on such 
re-offered honey shall have the same maturity date as the original loan.

<R05>
Sec. 1434.7  Approved storage.

    (a) Loans will be made only on honey in approved storage, which 
shall consist of a storage structure located on or off the farm that is 
determined by CCC to be under the control of the producer and affords 
safe storage for honey pledged as collateral for a loan. If the honey 
located in a farm storage structure is pledged as collateral that 
secures more than one loan, the honey must be segregated so as to 
preserve the identity of the honey securing such loan. Honey securing a 
loan must also be segregated from any honey not pledged as collateral 
for a loan that is stored in the same structure.
    (b) Producers may also obtain loans on honey packed in eligible 
containers and stored in facilities owned by third parties in which the 
honey of more than one person is stored if the honey that is to be 
pledged as collateral for a loan and that is stored identity preserved 
or is segregated from all other honey. Each container of the segregated 
quantity of honey shall be marked with the producer's name, loan number, 
and lot number so as to identify the honey from other honey stored in 
the structure.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.8  Containers and drums.

    (a)(1) The honey must be packed in plastic Intermediate Bulk 
Container (IBC) or metal containers of a capacity of not less than 5

protective cage with a 275 and 330 gallon capacity and is reusable. The 
metal containers must meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and regulations issued thereunder and must 
be generally fit for the purpose for which they are to be used;
    (2) The 5-gallon containers must hold approximately 60 pounds of 
honey, and must be new, clean, sound, uncased, and free from appreciable 
dents and rust. The handle of each container must be firm and strong 
enough to permit carrying the filled container. The cover and can 
opening must not be damaged in any way that will prevent a tight seal. 
Cans that are punctured or have been punctured and resealed by soldering 
will not be acceptable; and
    (3) The steel drums must be an open-end type and filled no closer 
than 2 inches from the top of the drums. Such drums must be new or must 
be used drums that have been reconditioned inside and outside. The steel 
drums must be clean, treated inside and outside to prevent rusting, 
fitted with gaskets that provide a tight seal and have an inside coating 
suitable for honey storage.
    (b) Honey shall not be eligible to be pledged as collateral for 
loans if such honey is stored in:
    (1) 55-gallon steel drums having a tare weight less than 38 pounds, 
30-gallon steel drums having a tare weight less than 26 pounds, or drums 
having removable liners of polyethylene or other materials;
    (2) Bung-type drums;
    (3) Bulk tanks;
    (4) Plastic buckets and containers;
    (5) Steel drums that are severely enough dented as to cause damage

    The amount of a marketing assistance loan and loan deficiency 
payment shall be based on 100 percent of the net weight in pounds of 
such quantity certified by the producer and verified by the county 
office representative for honey on Form CCC-633 (Honey) that is eligible 
to be pledged as security for the loan or LDP Estimates of the quantity 
of honey shall be made on the basis of 12 pounds for each gallon of 
rated capacity of the container.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.10  Application, availability, disbursement, and maturity.

    (a) A producer must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request 
loans and loan deficiency payments at the appropriate FSA county office 
responsible for administering the program as provided under part 718 of 
this title. To receive loans and loan deficiency payments for honey, a 
producer shall execute a note and security agreement or loan deficiency 
payment application on

[[Page 491]]

or before March 31 of the year following the year in which the honey was 
extracted.
    (b) A producer must request a loan at the county office of the 
county where the honey is stored if the honey is stored at the 
producer's farm. A producer who requests a loan on honey stored in 
eligible storage other than the producer's farm, may request loans at 
either the county office of the county where the storage facility is 
located or at the county office of the county where the producer's main 
place of business is located. A CMA must request loans at the county 
office for the county in which the principal office of the CMA is 
located unless the State committee designates another county office. If 
the CMA has operations in two or more States, the CMA must file its loan 
applications at the county office for the county in which its principal 
office for each State is located.
    (c) Loans will be made on the honey as declared and certified by the 
producer on Form CCC-633 (Honey), (Honey Loan Certification and 
Worksheet) at the time the honey is pledged as collateral for a loan. 
The producer is also required to declare and certify on Form CCC-633 
(Honey) the class (table or nontable) and floral source of the honey at 
the time the honey is pledged as collateral for a loan.
    (d) The request for a loan shall not be approved until all producers 
having an interest in the honey sign the note and security agreement and 
CCC approves such note and security agreement. The disbursement of loans 
will be made by county offices on behalf of CCC, for honey that:
    (1) Has been extracted;
    (2) Is in eligible storage; and
    (3) Has not been blended or mixed with ineligible honey.
    (e) Loans mature on demand but not later than the last day of the 
ninth calendar month following the month in which the note and security 
agreement was approved. When the final maturity date falls on a non-
workday for county offices, CCC shall extend the final date to the next 
workday. Before the date determined in paragraph (a) of this section, a 
producer may re-offer as loan collateral any eligible honey that has 
been offered previously for a CCC loan and the loan has been repaid at 
principal plus interest only.
    (f) If, after a loan is made, CCC determines that the producer or 
the honey collateral is not in compliance with any of the provisions of 
this part, the producer shall refund the total amount disbursed under 
loan and charges plus interest, including late payment interest as 
provided in part 1403 of this title.

storage structure over one.
    (b) Interest that accrues with respect to a loan shall be determined 
in accordance with part 1405 of this chapter.


<R05>

first and superior to all other security interests.
    (b) The county office shall file or record, as required by State 
law, all financing statements needed to perfect a security interest in 
honey pledged as collateral for a loan. The cost of filing and recording 
shall be for the account of CCC.
    (c) If there are any other security interests, liens, or 
encumbrances on the honey, CCC shall obtain waivers that fully protect 
the interest of CCC even though the security interests, liens, or 
encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional 
security interests, liens, or encumbrances shall be placed on the honey 
after the loan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.13  Transfer of producer's interest prohibited.

    Absent written approval from CCC, the producer shall not transfer 
either the remaining interest in, or right to redeem, the honey pledged 
as collateral for a loan on honey nor shall anyone acquire such interest 
or right. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1434.17, a producer who 
wishes to liquidate all or part of a loan by contracting for the sale of 
the honey must obtain written approval

[[Page 492]]

from the county office on a form prescribed by CCC to remove a specified 
quantity of the honey from storage. Any such approval shall be subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form, copies of 
which may be obtained by producers at the county office.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.14  Loss or damage.

    The producer is responsible for any loss in quantity or quality of 
the honey pledged as collateral for a loan. CCC shall not assume any

<R05>
Sec. 1434.15  Personal liability of the producer.

    (a) When applying for an individual or joint loan or loan deficiency 
payment, each producer agrees:
    (1) When signing Form CCC-633 (Honey), Honey Loan Certification and 
Worksheet and Form CCC-677, Farm Storage Note and Security Agreement, 
that the producer will:
    (i) Provide correct, accurate, and truthful certifications and 
representations of the loan quantity and all other matters of fact and 
interest; and
    (ii) Not remove or dispose of any amount of the loan quantity 
without prior written approval from CCC in accordance with this section.
    (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of this part and Form 
CCC-677 will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed 
to the producer for a loan quantity that is not actually in existence or 
for a quantity for which the producer is not eligible.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, violations include any failure 
to comply with this part or the loan agreement, including but not 
limited to any incorrect certification or:
    (1) Unauthorized removal of honey, which shall include, but is not 
limited to, the movement of any loan quantity of honey from the storage 
structure in the commodity was stored when the loan was approved to any 
other storage structure whether or not such structure is located on the 
producer's farm without prior written authorization from the county 
committee in accordance with Sec. 1434.14;
    (2) Any unauthorized disposition, which shall include, but is not 
limited to, the conversion of any loan quantity pledged as collateral 
for a loan without prior written authorization from the county committee 
in accordance with this section.
    (c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for conduct that is in 
violation of this section. Accordingly, if the county committee 
determines that the producer has engaged in any such violation, 
liquidated damages shall be assessed in addition to any loan refund and 
other charges that may be due. The amount of such damages shall be 
computed using the quantity of honey that is involved in the violation 
and the following formula. If CCC determines the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
first offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for 
cases other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note.
    (d) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan 
quantity involved in the violation plus charges and interest; and
    (2) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days 
from the date of notification, call the applicable loan for all of the 
honey under loan, plus charges and interest.
    (e) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, the county committee shall call the loan 
involved in the violation, and charges plus interest.
    (f) The county committee:

[[Page 493]]

    (1) May waive the administrative actions taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section if the county committee 
determines that:
    (i) The violation occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or 
unintentionally; or
    (ii) The producer acted to prevent spoilage of the commodity.
    (2) Shall not consider the following acts as inadvertent, 
accidental, or unintentional:
    (i) Movement of loan collateral off the farm;
    (ii) Movement of loan collateral from one storage structure to 
another on the farm; and (iii) Consumption of loan collateral.
    (g) If there is any violation of the loan agreement or this part, 
the loan may be terminated in which case there must be a full refund of 
the loan plus interest and costs.
    (h) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
violated this part or the loan agreement, the county committee shall 
notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to 
the county committee, and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section.
    (i)(1) If a producer:
    (i) Makes any fraudulent or misleading representation in obtaining a 
loan, maintaining, or settling a loan; or
    (ii) Disposes or moves the loan collateral without the approval of 
CCC, such loan shall become payable upon demand by CCC. The producer 
shall be liable for:
    (A) The amount of the loan;
    (B) Any additional amounts paid by CCC with respect to the loan;
    (C) All other costs that CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation, the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (D) Interest on such amounts;
    (E) Late payment interest as may be provided for in part 1403 of 
this title; and
    (F) Liquidated damages assessed under paragraph (c) of this section; 
and
    (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent or misleading 
representation to CCC or if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the 
loan collateral without prior written approval from CCC in accordance 
with this section, the value of the settlement for such collateral 
removed by CCC shall be determined by CCC according to this section.
    (j) A producer shall be personally liable for any damages resulting 
from honey removed by CCC, containing mercurial compounds or other 
substances poisonous to humans, animals, or food commodities that are 
contaminated.
    (k) If the amount disbursed under a loan or in settlement thereof 
exceeds the amount authorized under this part, the producer shall be 
personally liable for repayment of such excess and charges, plus 
interest, and for any other sanction as may be allowed by law.
    (l) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan is less than the amount required in accordance with this part, the 
producer shall be personally liable for repayment of the amount of such 
deficiency and charges, plus interest.
    (m) In the case of joint loans, the personal liability for the 
amounts specified in this section shall be joint and several on the part 
of each producer signing the loan note. Further, each producer who is a 
party to a joint loan will be jointly and severally liable for any 
violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security 
agreement, and the regulations set forth in this part. Each such 
producer shall also remain liable for repayment of the entire loan 
amount until the loan is fully repaid without regard to such producer's 
claimed share in the honey, or loan proceeds, after execution of the 
note and security agreement by CCC.
    (n) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section may be waived as 
determined by CCC.
    (o) Remedies set out in this section are in addition to remedies the 
CCC

[[Page 494]]

will have through its security interest on honey that secures the 
repayment of the loan made on the honey.
    (p) All remedies provided for in this section or part are in 
addition to any remedies as may otherwise be provided for in law.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.16  Release of the honey pledged as collateral for a loan.

    (3) When the proceeds of a sale of honey are needed to repay all or 
part of a loan, the producer must request and obtain prior written

remove a specified quantity of the honey from storage. Any such approval 
shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable 
form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the county office. 
Any such approval shall not constitute a release of CCC's security 
interest in the commodity or release the producer from liability for any 
amounts due and owing to CCC with respect to any loan indebtedness if

    (b) The note and security agreement shall not be released until all 
loan liability has been satisfied in full.
    (c) After satisfaction of a loan, CCC shall release CCC's security 
interest in the honey at the producer's request. The producer shall be 
responsible for payment of any fee for such release if such fee can be 
determined.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.17  Liquidation of loans.

    (a) The producer is required to repay the loan on or before maturity 
by payment of the amount of loan, plus any charges, plus interest.
    (b) If a producer fails to settle the loan in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section within 30 calendar days from the maturity 
date of such loan, or other reasonable time period as established by 
CCC, a claim for the loan amount, plus charges, plus interest shall be

<R05>
Sec. 1434.19  Settlement.

    The value of the settlement of loans shall be made by CCC on the 
following basis:
    (a) With respect to nonrecourse loans, the schedule of premiums and 
discounts for the commodity:
    (1) If the value of the collateral at settlement is less than the 
amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency 
and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or
    (2) If the value of the collateral at settlement is greater than the 
amount due, such excess shall be retained by CCC and CCC shall have no 
obligation to pay such amount to any party.
    (b) With respect to honey that is delivered from other than an 
approved warehouse, settlement shall be made by CCC on the basis of the 
basic loan rate that is in effect for the commodity at the producer's 
customary delivery point, as determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.20  Foreclosure.

    (a) Upon maturity and nonpayment of the loan, title to the 
unredeemed

[[Page 495]]

honey securing the loan shall vest in CCC.
    (b) If the total amount due on a loan or the unpaid amount of the 
note and charges, plus interest is not satisfied upon maturity, CCC may 
remove the honey from storage and assign, transfer, and deliver the 
honey or documents evidencing title thereto at such time, in such 
manner, and upon such terms as CCC may determine at public or private 
sale. Any such disposition may also be effected without removing the 
honey from storage. The honey may be processed before sale and CCC may 
become the purchaser of the whole or any part of the honey at either a 
public or private sale.
    (1) If the value of the collateral computed at settlement is less 
than the amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such 
deficiency and charges, plus interest on such deficiency and CCC may 
take any action against the producer to recover the deficiency; or
    (2) If the proceeds received from the sale of the honey so computed 
are greater than the sum of the amount due plus any cost incurred by CCC 
in conducting the sale of the honey, such excess shall be paid to the 
producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of the producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.21  Loan deficiency payments.

    (a) Loan deficiency payments shall be available for 2002-2007 crop 
honey.
    (b) In order to be eligible to receive loan deficiency payment for a 
crop of honey, the producer must:
    (1) Comply with all of the program requirements to be eligible to 
obtain loan in accordance with this part;
    (2) Agree to forego obtaining such loans;
    (3) Submitted a request for a honey Loan deficiency payment on the 
form as CCC prescribes.
    (4) Comply with Secs. 1434.7 and 1434.8 or provide evidence of 
production as determined by CCC for such quantity; and
    (5) Otherwise comply with all program requirements.
    (c) The loan deficiency payment rate for a crop shall be the amount 
by which the marketing assistance loan rate exceeds the rate at which 
CCC has announced that producers may repay their marketing assistance 
loan in accordance with Sec. 1434.18.
    (d) The loan deficiency payment applicable to a crop of honey shall 
be computed by multiplying the loan deficiency payment rate, as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, by the 
quantity of honey the producer is eligible to pledge as collateral for a 
price support loan for which a loan deficiency payment is required.
    (e) Notwithstanding any provisions in this section, loan deficiency 
payments may be based on 100 percent of the net quantity specified on 
acceptable evidence of disposition of the honey certified as eligible 
for a loan deficiency payment if CCC determines that such quantity 
represented the quantity for the number of containers of honey initially 
certified for the loan deficiency payment when the payment was made.
    (f) When applying for an individual loan deficiency payment, each 
producer agrees:
    (1) The producer will provide correct, accurate, and truthful 
certifications and representations of the loan quantity and all other 
matters of fact and interest when submitting a request for a honey loan 
deficiency payment; and
    (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of this part will 
cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the 
producer for a LDP quantity that is not actually in existence or for a 
quantity for which the producer is not eligible.
    (g) For the purposes of this section, violations include any failure 
to comply with this part or the loan agreement, including but not 
limited to any incorrect certification.

<R05>
Sec. 1434.22  Handling payments and collections not exceeding $9.99.

    In order to avoid administrative costs of making small payments and 
handling small accounts, amounts of $9.99 or less that are due the 
producer will be paid only upon the producer's request. Deficiencies of 
$9.99 or less, including interest, may be disregarded unless demand for 
payment is made by CCC.

[[Page 496]]


<R05>
Sec. 1434.23  Death, incompetency, or disappearance; appeals; other loan provisions.

    (a) In the case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any 
producer who is entitled to the payment of any sum in settlement of a 
loan, payment shall, upon proper application to the county office that 
made the loan, be made to the persons who would be entitled to such 
producer's share under the regulations contained in part 707 of this 
title. Applications for loans may be made upon application of a 
representative of the producer as allowed under standard practice for 
farm programs.
    (b) Appeals of adverse decisions made under this part shall be 
subject to the provisions of 7 CFR parts 11 and 780.

as CCC determines, that will be produced in the cane State or by the 
sugarcane processor, as appropriate, during the applicable crop year.
    Allocation means the division of the beet sugar allotment among the 
sugar beet processors in the United States and the division of each 
State's cane sugar allotment among the State's sugarcane processors.
    Beet sugar means sugar that is processed directly or indirectly from 
sugar beets or sugar beet molasses.
    Beet sugar allotment means that portion of the overall allotment 
quantity allocated to sugar beet processors.
    Cane sugar means sugar derived directly or indirectly from sugarcane 
produced in the United States, including sugar produced from sugarcane 
molasses.
    Cane sugar allotment means that portion of the overall allotment 
quantity allocated to sugarcane processors.
    Cane sugar refiner means a person who processes raw sugar into 
refined crystalline sugar or liquid sugar.
    Carry-in stocks means inventories of sugar owned by sugar beet 
processors, sugarcane processors, cane sugar refiners, and CCC and 
physically located in the United States at the beginning of the fiscal 
year.
    Crop year means the period from October 1 through September 30, 
inclusive, and is identified by the year in which the crop year begins. 
For example, the 2002 crop year begins on October 1, 2002. The 2002 crop 
of sugar beets or sugar cane means domestically grown sugar beets or 
sugar cane processed during the 2002 crop year. The 2002 crop of sugar 
means sugar processed from domestically-grown sugar beets or sugarcane 
during the 2002 crop year. Sugar from de-sugaring molasses is considered 
to be from the crop year the de-sugaring occurred.
    Deputy Administrator means the Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, 
FSA, or designee.
    Deficit means the quantity of sugar covered by an allocation of an 
allotment that CCC estimates a sugar beet processor or sugarcane 
processor will be unable to market during the crop year in which 
marketing allotments are in effect.
    Edible molasses means molasses that is not to be further refined or 
improved in quality and that is to be distributed for human consumption, 
either directly or in molasses-containing products.

consumption, either directly or in syrup-containing products.
    Executive Vice President, CCC, means the Executive Vice President, 
CCC, or designee.
    Farm means that entity as defined in Sec. 718 of this title, except 
that when a State is subject to proportionate shares, producers will not 
be allowed to have farms reconstituted across State lines even if the 
farm land is adjoining.
    Fiscal year means that year beginning October 1 and ending the 
following September 30.
    FSA means Farm Service Agency.
    Imports means sugar originating in foreign countries or areas and 
entered, or to be entered, into the United States customs territory.
    In-process sugar means the intermediate sugar containing products, 
as CCC determines, produced in the processing of domestic sugar beets 
and sugarcane. It does not include raw sugar, liquid sugar, invert 
sugar, invert syrup, or other finished products that are otherwise 
eligible for a loan.
    Market or marketing means the transfer of title associated with the 
sale or other disposition of sugar in United States commerce, including 
the forfeiture of sugar loan collateral under Subpart B, and for any 
integrated processor and refiner, the movement of raw cane sugar into 
the refining process. Marketings do not include sales for nondomestic or 
nonhuman consumption, or sales of sugar to enable another processor to 
fulfill an allocation established for such processor.
    Nonrecourse loan means a loan for which eligible sugar offered as 
loan collateral may be forfeited to CCC, at loan

[[Page 498]]

maturity, in satisfaction of loan indebtedness.

sugarcane or domestically produced sugar from sugar beets, and the raw 
value equivalent of sugar in sugar products, that is permitted to be 
marketed by processors, during a crop year or other period in which 
marketing allotments are in effect.
    Past marketings means, for purposes of determining State cane sugar 
allotments and sugarcane processor allocations for States other than 
Louisiana, the average of the 2 highest years of sugar production during 
the 1996 through 2000 crop years; for Louisiana sugarcane processor 
allocations, the average of the 2 highest years of sugar production 
during the 1997 through 2001 crop years.
    Past processing means, for determining Hawaii and Puerto Rico's 
allotments, the 3-year average of the 1998 through 2000 crop years; and 
for determining the remaining cane State allotments, the 3 crop years 
with the greatest production (in the States collectively) during the 
1991 through 2000 crop years. Past processing, for determining the 
sugarcane processor allocation for States other than Louisiana, means 
the average of the 3 highest years of production during the 1996 through 
2000 crop years; and, for determining sugarcane processor allocations in 
Louisiana, the average of the 2 highest years of sugar production during 
the 1997 through 2001 crop years.
    Per-acre yield goal means a State's yield level that is established 
at not less than the State's two highest average per-acre yield years 
from among the 1999 through 2001 crop years as CCC determines to ensure 
an adequate net return per pound to State producers.
    Proportionate share means the total acreage from which a producer 
may harvest sugarcane for sugar or seed during any crop year or other 
period in which marketing allotments are in effect.
    Raw sugar means any sugar that is to be further refined or improved 
in quality other than in-process sugar.
    Raw value of any quantity of sugar means its equivalent in terms of 
raw sugar testing 96 sugar degrees, as determined by a polarimetric test 
performed under procedures recognized by the International Commission 
for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA). Direct-consumption sugar 
derived from sugar beets and testing 92 or more sugar degrees by the 
polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value by multiplying 
the actual number of pounds of such sugar by 1.07. Sugar derived from 
sugarcane and testing 92 sugar degrees or more by the polariscope shall 
be translated into terms of raw value in the following manner:raw value 
= {[lsqb](actual degree of polarization - 92) x 0.0175[rsqb] + 
0.93{time}  x actual weight.For sugar testing less than 92 sugar degrees 
by the polariscope, derive raw value by dividing the number of pounds of 
the ``total sugar content'' (i.e., the sum of the sucrose and invert 
sugars) thereof by 0.972.
    Reasonable carryover stocks means desirable inventories of sugar 
owned by sugar beet processors, sugarcane processors, cane sugar 
refiners, and CCC and on hand in the United States at the end of the 
fiscal year, as CCC determines.
    State means any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    Sugar means any grade or type of saccharine product derived, 
directly or indirectly, from sugarcane or sugar beets and consisting of, 
or containing, sucrose or invert sugar, including raw sugar, refined 
crystalline sugar, liquid sugar, edible molasses, and edible cane syrup. 
For allotments, sugar means any grade or type of saccharine product 
processed, directly or indirectly, from sugarcane or sugar beets 
(including sugar produced from sugar beet or sugarcane molasses), 
produced for human consumption, and consisting of, or containing, 
sucrose or invert sugar, including raw sugar, refined crystalline sugar, 
edible molasses, edible cane syrup, and liquid sugar.
    Sugar beet processor means a person who commercially produces sugar, 
directly or indirectly, from sugar beets (including sugar produced from 
sugar beet molasses), has a viable processing

[[Page 499]]

facility, and a supply of sugar beets for the applicable allotment year.
    Sugar products means products for human consumption, other than 
sugar, that contain 50 percent or more of sucrose, on a dry weight 
basis, and that are marketed by a sugar beet processor or sugarcane 
processor. In determining sugar subject to marketing allocations, only 
the sugar content of such products will be counted against the 
allocation.
    Sugarcane processor means a person who commercially produces sugar, 
directly or indirectly, from sugarcane, has a viable processing 
facility, and a supply of sugarcane for the applicable allotment year.
    Ton means a short ton or 2,000 pounds.
    United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    U.S. market value means, for sugarcane, the daily New York Board of 
Trade No. 14 contract price for raw sugar, or other price, as determined 
by CCC; for sugar beets, the Midwest refined beet sugar price published 
in Milling and Baking News, or other price, as determined by CCC.
    USDA means the United States Department of Agriculture.

processor, cane sugar refiner, importer of sugars, syrups, and molasses, 
or of any other person having custody of records that the examining 
agency deems necessary to verify compliance with this part's 
requirements. The examining agency has the right to inspect, examine, 
and make copies of such books, records, accounts, and other written or 
electronic data as the examining agency deems relevant.
    (b) Each sugar beet processor, sugarcane processor, importer of 
sugars, syrups and molasses, and cane sugar refiner or any person having 
custody of the records shall retain such books, records, accounts, and 
other written or electronic data for not less than 3 years from the 
date:
    (1) A loan is disbursed under subpart B;
    (2) Market data are reported to CCC under subpart C of this part; 
and
    (3) Marketings are conducted under marketing allotments under 
subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.4  Administration.

    (a) This program shall be administered under the general supervision 
of the Executive Vice President, CCC, and may be carried out in the 
field by FSA State and county committees.

committees to waive or modify deadlines and other program requirements 
in cases where lateness or failure to meet such requirements do not 
adversely affect program operation.
    (f) A CCC representative may execute loans and related documents 
only under the terms and conditions CCC determines and announces. Any 
such document not executed under such terms and conditions, including 
any purported execution before the CCC-authorized date, shall be null 
and void.

eligible to be pledged as loan collateral.
    (c)(1) A processor may, within the loan availability period, 
repledge as collateral sugar that previously served as loan collateral 
for a repaid loan. In making application for such a loan, the processor 
shall:
    (i) Specify that the loan collateral should be treated as a quantity 
of eligible sugar that previously served as loan collateral for a repaid 
loan; and
    (ii) Designate the loan to which the reoffered loan collateral was 
originally pledged.
    (2) The subsequent loan shall have the same maturity date as the 
original loan.
    (3) Loan collateral repledged that was previously redeemed from CCC 
is not included in determining the total quantity of sugar on which 
loans have been obtained for purposes of Sec. 1435.102.
    (d) Raw cane sugar loan disbursements shall be made without regard 
to the actual polarity or quality factors of the sugar pledged as loan 
collateral but shall be made on the assumption that the polarity of such 
sugar is 96 degrees by the polariscope.
    (e)(1) Loans will mature at the earlier of:
    (i) the end of the 9-month period beginning on the 1st day of the 
first month after the month in which the loan is made; or
    (ii) September 30 following disbursement of the loan.
    (2) CCC may accelerate loan maturity dates under Sec. 1435.105(h).
    (f) Processors receiving loans in July, August, or September may 
repledge the sugar as collateral for a supplemental loan. Such 
supplemental loan shall:
    (1) Be requested by the processor during the following October;
    (2) Be made at the loan rate in effect at the time the supplemental 
loan is made; and
    (3) Mature in 9 months minus the number of whole months that the 
initial loan was in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.104  Loan maintenance.

    (a) All processors receiving loans shall:
    (1) Abide by the terms and conditions of the loan application, note 
and security agreement and storage agreement;
    (2) Pay interest on the principal at a rate determined in part 1405 
of this chapter.
    (b) The security interests CCC obtains as a result of the execution 
of security agreements by sugarcane and sugar beet processors shall be 
superior to all statutory and common law liens

[[Page 502]]

on raw cane sugar, refined beet sugar, and in-process sugar for the 
producers of sugarcane and sugar beets and all prior recorded and 
unrecorded liens on the crops of sugarcane and sugar beets from which 
the sugar was derived.
    (c) A processor receiving a loan under this part shall pay all 
eligible producers who have delivered or will deliver sugar beets or 
sugarcane to such processors for processing not less than the minimum 
payment levels CCC specifies for the applicable crop year.
    (1) In the case of sugar beets, the minimum payment shall not exceed 
the rate of payment provided for under the applicable contract between a 
sugar beet producer and a sugar beet processor.
    (2) CCC will not reject a loan application from a beet sugar 
processor from eligibility to obtain a loan under this section solely 
because of the failure of the processor to provide the appropriate 
minimum payment established under this subsection if the failure:
    (i) Occurred during a crop year before the date of enactment of the 
Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002; and
    (ii) Was related, at least in part, to the effects of a natural 
disaster, including freeze damage.
    (3) In the case of sugarcane, CCC will annually determine and 
announce the annual grower minimum payment.
    (4) Processors are ineligible for loans for the crop year following 
their failure to meet the required minimum grower payment.
    (d)(1) A processor shall maintain eligible sugar or in-process sugar 
of sufficient quality and quantity as collateral to satisfy the 
processor's loan indebtedness to CCC. CCC shall not assume any loss in 
quantity or quality of the loan collateral.
    (2) The processor is responsible for storage costs through the loan 
maturity date or title transfer to CCC, whichever occurs later.
    (3) Sugar and in-process sugar pledged as loan collateral need not 
be stored identity preserved.
    (4) When the proceeds of the sale of loan collateral are needed to 
repay all or part of a sugar loan, the processor may request and obtain 
prior written approval from the loan making office by executing a loan 
collateral release request, as prescribed by CCC, to remove a specified 
quantity of the loan collateral from storage for the purpose of 
delivering it to a buyer before loan repayment. Any such approval shall 
be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form. 
The loan making office shall not approve such a request unless the buyer 
of the sugar agrees to pay CCC an amount necessary to satisfy the 
processor's loan indebtedness regarding collateral being sold. Any such 
approval shall not:
    (i) Constitute a release of CCC's security interest in the loan 
collateral; or
    (ii) Relieve the processor of liability for the full amount of the 
loan indebtedness, including interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.105  Loan settlement and foreclosure.

    (a) A processor may, any time before loan maturity, redeem all or 
any part of the loan collateral by paying CCC the applicable principal 
and interest.
    (b) Forfeiture of sugar loan collateral will be accepted as payment 
in full of the principal and interest due under a nonrecourse loan, 
applicable to the quality and quantity of sugar delivered, subject to 
applicable premiums and discounts.
    (c)(1) Forfeiture of in-process sugar serving as loan collateral 
will be accepted as payment in full of principal and interest if the 
processor converts the in-process sugar into raw cane sugar or refined 
beet sugar of acceptable grade and quality for sugar eligible for loans 
within 1 month of loan maturity.
    (2) The in-process sugar must be fully processed into raw cane sugar 
or refined beet sugar, the processor shall transfer the sugar to CCC.
    (3) On transfer of the sugar, CCC shall make a payment to the 
processor in an amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the 
difference between the loan rate for raw cane sugar or refined beet 
sugar, as appropriate, and the in-process loan rate the processor 
received by the quantity of sugar transferred to CCC. The loan agreement 
shall specify the quantity of sugar that can be forfeited to CCC.

[[Page 503]]

    (d) If the processor does not forfeit the collateral, but instead 
further processes the in-process sugar into raw cane sugar or refined 
beet sugar and repays the loan on the in-process sugar;
    (1) the processor may obtain a loan for the raw cane sugar or 
refined beet sugar, as appropriate, and
    (2) the term of a loan made under this subsection for a quantity of 
in-process sugar, when combined with the term of a loan made for the raw 
cane sugar or refined beet sugar derived from the in-process sugar, may 
not exceed 9 months.
    (e) CCC shall not accept delivery of sugar in settlement of a 
nonrecourse loan in excess of the quantity of sugar that is shown on the 
note and security agreement minus any quantity that was redeemed or 
released for removal under this section.
    (f) If the processor does not redeem any of the nonrecourse loan 
collateral, title to the unredeemed nonrecourse loan collateral as 
described in the note and security agreement will, without further CCC 
or processor action transfer to CCC in-store at the CCC-approved 
warehouse at 12 a.m. the day following the maturity date of the loan. 
Title, all rights, and interest to such sugar shall immediately vest in 
CCC.
    (g) The value of the settlement of loans shall be made by CCC 
according to the CCC schedule of premiums and discounts.
    (h) CCC may, at any time, accelerate the date for loan repayment 
including interest. CCC will give the processor notice of such 
acceleration at least 15 days in advance of the accelerated loan 
maturity date.
    (i) If a processor's nonrecourse loan indebtedness is not satisfied 
under the provisions of this section or if forfeited in-process sugar is 
not converted to raw or refined sugar within the prescribed time:
    (1) Interest on the processor's indebtedness shall accrue as 
specified in part 1403 of this title and shall accrue until the debt is 
paid;
    (2) CCC may, upon notice, with or without removing the collateral 
from storage, sell such collateral at either a public or private sale;
    (3) The processor shall be liable for the deficiency if the net 
proceeds are less than the amount of principal, interest, and any other 
charges CCC incurs; and
    (4) If the processor forfeits the in-process sugar loan collateral 
but does not transfer raw or refined sugar of suitable quality to CCC 
within 1 month, CCC will charge liquidated damages, as provided in the 
loan agreement.

Rico.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.301  Annual estimates and quarterly re-estimates.

    (a) Not later than August 1 before the beginning of the crop year, 
CCC will estimate, and make re-estimates as necessary but not later than 
the beginning of each quarter of such crop year, the:
    (1) Quantity of sugar that will be consumed in the United States 
(other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or 
to be refined and re-exported in refined form or in sugar-containing 
products);
    (2) Quantity of sugar that will provide for reasonable carryover 
stocks;
    (3) Quantity of sugar that will be available for consumption from 
carry-in stocks;
    (4) Quantity of sugar that will be available for consumption from 
domestic processing of sugarcane and sugar beets; and
    (5) Quantity of sugars, syrups, and molasses that will be imported 
for human consumption or for the extraction of sugar for human

[[Page 505]]

whether such articles are included in a tariff-rate quota or not.
    (b) Calculation of all allotments, allocations, estimates, and re-
estimates in this subpart will use available USDA statistics and 
estimates of production, consumption, and stocks, taking into account, 
where appropriate, data supplied in reports submitted pursuant to the 
reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 1435.200.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.302  Establishment and suspension of allotments.

    (a) By the beginning of the crop year, CCC will establish the 
overall allotment quantity, beet sugar and cane sugar allotments, State 
cane sugar allotments, and allocations for processors marketing sugar 
domestically processed from sugar beets and domestically produced 
sugarcane at a level estimated to result in no sugar loan collateral 
forfeitures to CCC.
    (b) Marketing allotments will be suspended whenever CCC determines 
that imports of sugars, syrups, and molasses for domestic human 
consumption or to be used for the extraction of sugar for domestic human 
consumption, whether under a tariff-rate quota or not, will exceed 
1,532,000 short tons, raw value, excluding any imports attributable to a 
reassignment of allotments, and that the imports would lead to a 
reduction in the overall allotment quantity. The suspension of marketing 
allotments will be lifted if CCC subsequently determines that imports 
are estimated to be no higher than 1,532,000 short tons, raw value.
    (c) Each determination under this section to establish or suspend 
marketing allotments will be published in the Federal Register and 
accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the determination.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.303  Overall allotment quantity.

    The overall allotment quantity for the crop year will be calculated 
by deducting from the sum of estimated sugar consumption and reasonable 
carryover stocks:
    (a) 1,532,000 short tons, raw value; and
    (b) Carry-in stocks.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.304  Adjustment of the overall allotment quantity.

    (a) The overall allotment quantity will be adjusted, as CCC 
determines appropriate,
    (1) To avoid forfeiture of sugar loan collateral to CCC, and
    (2) To reflect changes in estimated consumption, stocks, production, 
or imports based on re-estimates under Sec. 1435.301.
    (b) Each determination to adjust the overall allotment quantity will 
be published in the Federal Register and accompanied by a statement of 
the reasons for the determination.
    (c) The beet sugar allotment, cane sugar allotment, State cane sugar 
allotments, proportionate shares, and allocations to each sugar beet 
processor and sugarcane processor will be increased or decreased, as 
appropriate, to reflect an overall allotment quantity adjustment.
    (d) If the overall allotment quantity is reduced under paragraph (a) 
of this section and the quantity of sugar and sugar products any 
individual processor marketed by the time of the reduction exceeds the 
processor's reduced allocation, the quantity of excess sugar or sugar 
products marketed will be deducted from the processor's allocation under 
an allotment next established.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.305  Beet and cane sugar allotments.

    (a) The allotment for beet sugar will be 54.35 percent of the 
overall allotment quantity.
    (b) The allotment for cane sugar will be 45.65 percent of the 
overall allotment quantity.
    (c) A sugar beet processor allocated a share of the beet sugar 
allotment may use only beet sugar to fill such allocation. A sugarcane 
processor allocated a share of the cane sugar allotment may use only 
cane sugar to fill such allocation.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.306  State cane sugar allotments.

    (a) Hawaii and Puerto Rico will be allotted a total of 325,000 short 
tons, raw value, of the cane sugar allotment.
    (b) A new entrant cane State will receive an allotment to 
accommodate a new processor's allocation under 1435.308(f).

[[Page 506]]

    (c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the remaining 
cane States will be allotted, in aggregate, the remaining cane sugar 
allotment.
    (d) The individual cane State allotments, other than a new entrant 
cane State, will be based on:
    (1) Past marketings of cane sugar,
    (2) Past processing of cane sugar, and
    (3) The ability to market the sugar covered under the allotment 
assigned to the State.
    (e) Past marketings and past processings will each be weighted by 
0.25 and the ability to market will be weighted by 0.50 in determining 
the States' respective cane sugar allotments. The weights may be 
adjusted, as CCC deems appropriate, for the crop year.
    (f) Except when deficits are reassigned as provided in 
Sec. 1435.309, a processor may fill an allocation of a cane sugar 
allotment only with sugar processed from sugarcane grown in the State 
for which the allotment was established.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.307  Allocation of marketing allotments to processors.

    (a) Each sugar beet processor's allocation of the beet allotment 
will be calculated as the beet processor's share times the beet sector 
allotment:
    (1) A beet processor's share is calculated as the beet processor's 
adjusted weighted average sugar production divided by the sum of all 
beet processors' adjusted weighted average sugar production.
    (2) A beet processor's weighted average sugar production equals 0.25 
times its 1998-crop sugar production plus 0.35 times its 1999-crop sugar 
production plus 0.40 times its 2000-crop sugar production, with the 2000 
sugar PIK payments added to its 2000-crop sugar production.
    (3) A beet processor's weighted average sugar production shall be 
adjusted by the following, as CCC determines:
    (i) Increased 1.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' 
weighted average sugar production for opening a sugar factory during the 
1996 through 2000 crop years;
    (ii) Decreased 1.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' 
weighted average sugar production for closing a sugar factory during the 
1998 through 2000 crops years;
    (iii) Increased 0.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' 
weighted average sugar production for opening a molasses desugarization 
facility during the 1998 through 2000 crop years; and
    (iv) Increased 1.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' 
weighted average sugar production for suffering a substantial quality 
loss on stored beets, as CCC determines, during the 1998 through 2000 
crop years.
    (b) Each sugarcane processors' allocation from a State cane sugar 
allotment will be calculated as the cane processor's share times the 
State cane sector allotment.
    (1) Each cane processor's share, other than a new entrant, will be 
calculated as the processor's production base divided by the sum of the 
State's processor production bases.
    (2) A processor's production base, other than a new entrants, is the 
sum of 0.50 times its ability to market plus 0.25 times its past 
processings plus 0.25 times its past marketings. These weights may be 
adjusted as CCC deems appropriate for the crop year.
    (3) CCC will calculate an allocation for the Talisman processing 
facility, based on paragraph (b)(2) of this section and distribute the 
allocation among Florida processors according to the agreements between 
cane processors and the Secretary of the Interior dated March 25, and 
March 26, 1999.
    (c) An informal hearing will be held in August of each year, if 
requested by affected sugarcane processors and growers by July 15th, to 
afford all interested persons the opportunity to comment on the next 
crop year's marketing allotments and allocations. After consideration of 
comments obtained at the hearing, a final determination on cane State 
allotments and processor allocations will be announced.
    (d) During any crop year in which marketing allotments are in effect 
and allocated to processors, the quantity of sugar and sugar products 
that a processor markets shall not exceed the quantity of the 
processor's allocation.
    (e) Paragraph (d) of this section shall not apply to:

[[Page 507]]

    (1) Any sugar marketings to facilitate the export of sugar or sugar-
containing products,
    (2) Any sugar marketings for nonhuman consumption, and
    (3) Any processor marketings of sugar to another processor made to 
enable the purchasing processor to fulfill its allocation if such sales:
    (i) Are made before May 1, and
    (ii) Reported to CCC within 5 days of the date of sale.
    (f) CCC may charge liquidated damages as specified in a surplus 
allocation survey and agreement on such sales made after May 1 if the 
purchasing processor had surplus allocation after May 1 because the 
purchasing processor provided incomplete or erroneous information to 
CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.308  Transfer of allocation, new entrants

    (a) If a sugar beet or sugarcane processing facility is closed and 
the growers that delivered their crops to the closed facility elect to 
deliver their crops to another processor, the growers may petition the 
Executive Vice President, CCC, to transfer the share of allocation 
commensurate with the growers' production history from the processor 
that closed the facility to their new processor. CCC may grant the 
request to transfer the allocation upon:
    (1) Written approval of the processing company that will accept the 
additional deliveries, and
    (2) Evidence satisfactory to CCC that the new processor has the 
capacity to accommodate the production of petitioning growers.
    (b) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, CCC will eliminate the 
allocation of the processor who has been dissolved or liquidated in a 
bankruptcy proceeding and the allocation will be distributed to all 
other processors on a pro-rata basis.
    (c) If the purchasing processor is not a new entrant, then the 
purchased plants must operate for the initial season and the following 
crop year for the purchasing processor to permanently obtain the 
allocation. CCC shall reassign the allocation on a pro rata basis if the 
purchased plants do not operate for the required 2 crop years.
    (d) If the purchasing processor is a new entrant, then CCC shall 
immediately transfer allocation commensurate with the purchased 
factories' production history with no requirement on operating the 
facility for 2 crop years.
    (e) Allocations, equal to the number of acres of proportionate 
shares being transferred times the State's per-acre yield goal, will be 
transferred between mills in proportionate share States, if the 
transfers are based on:
    (1) Written consent of the crop-share owners, or their 
representative representatives,
    (2) Written consent of the processing company holding the allocation 
for the subject proportionate shares,
    (3) Written consent of the processing company that will accept the 
additional sugarcane deliveries, and
    (4) Evidence, satisfactory to CCC, that the additional sugarcane 
deliveries will not exceed the processing capacity of the receiving 
company.
    (f) New entrants, not acquiring existing facilities, may apply to 
the Executive Vice President, CCC, for an allocation.
    (1) Applicants must demonstrate their ability to process, produce, 
and market sugar for the applicable crop year.
    (2) CCC will consider adverse effects of the allocation upon 
existing processors and producers.
    (3) New entrant cane processors are limited to 50,000 short tons, 
raw value, the first crop year.
    (4) New entrant cane processors will be provided, as determined by 
CCC,
    (i) A share of their State's cane allotment if the processor is 
located in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, or Texas, or
    (ii) A share of the overall cane allotment if the processor is 
located in any state not listed in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) If a new entrant acquires and reopens a factory that previously 
produced beet sugar from sugar beets and sugar beet molasses, but the 
factory last operated during the 1997 crop year, CCC will:
    (i) Assign an allocation to the new entrant not less than the 
greater of 1.67

[[Page 508]]

percent of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar 
produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years, as 
determined under Sec. 1435.307, or 1,500,000 hundredweight.
    (ii) Reduce all other beet processor allocations on a pro rata 
basis.

<R05>
Sec. 1435.309  Reassignment of deficits.

    (a) CCC will determine, by May 1, whether sugar beet or sugarcane 
processors will be able to market their respective allocations.
    (b) Sugarbeet and sugarcane processors will report to CCC, by April 
15, current inventories, estimated production, expected marketings, and 
any other pertinent factors CCC deems appropriate to determine a 
processor's ability to market its allocation.
    (c) If CCC determines a sugarcane processor will be unable to market 
its full allocation for the crop year in which an allotment is in 
effect, the deficit will:
    (1) First, be reassigned proportionately to allocations of other 
sugarcane processors within that State, depending on the capacity of 
each other processor to fill the portion of the deficit to be reassigned 
to it, and accounting for interests of associated producers;
    (2) If the deficit cannot be eliminated after reassignment within 
the same State, be reassigned to the other cane States based on the 
ability of processors in such States to market the deficit to be 
reassigned to such States, with the reassigned quantity to each State 
being allocated among its processors in proportion to initial processor 
allocations;
    (3) If the deficit cannot be eliminated by paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(c)(2) of this section, be reassigned to CCC. CCC shall sell such 
quantity from inventory unless CCC determines such sales would have a 
significant effect on the sugar price.
    (4) If any portion of the deficit remains after paragraphs (c)(1), 
(c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section have been implemented, be reassigned 
to imports.
    (d) If CCC determines that a sugar beet processor is unable to 
market its full allocation for the crop year in which an allotment is in 
effect, the deficit will:
    (1) First, be reassigned proportionately to allocations of other 
sugar beet processors, depending on the capacity of other processors to 
fill the portion of the deficit to be reassigned to them, accounting for 
the interests of associated producers.
    (2) If the deficit cannot be eliminated by paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, be reassigned to CCC. CCC shall sell such quantity from 
inventory unless CCC determines such sales would have a significant 
effect on the sugar price.
    (3) If any portion of the deficit remains after paragraphs (d)(1) 
and (d)(2) of this section have been implemented, be reassigned to 
imports.
    (e) The crop year allocation of each sugar beet or sugarcane 
processor who receives a reassignment will be increased accordingly for 
that year.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.310  Sharing processors' allocations with producers.

    (a) Every sugar beet and sugarcane processor must provide CCC a 
certification that:
    (1) The processor intends to share its allocation among its 
producers fairly and equitably, and in a manner adequately reflecting 
each producer's production history, and
    (2) The processor has, in the previous allotment year, shared its 
allocation among producers fairly and equitably, reflecting each 
producer's production history. If a processor is unable to provide such 
certification, CCC may reduce or eliminate its marketing allocation.
    (b) Any producer or processor may request arbitration of a dispute 
regarding the sharing of the processor's allocation among the producers. 
Arbitration will be available on behalf of CCC at the State FSA office 
for the State in which the processor is located. Subsequent review of 
the arbitration decision is available at the discretion of the Executive 
Vice President, CCC. Any arbitration is subject to appeal to the Office 
of the Administrative Law Judge, USDA.

Sec. 1435.311  Proportionate shares for sugarcane producers.

    (a) Proportionate shares and the provisions of this section and 
Secs. 1435.312 through 1435.316 apply only to Louisiana sugarcane farms.
    (b) CCC will determine whether Louisiana sugar production, in the 
absence of proportionate shares, will exceed the quantity needed to 
enable processors to fill the State cane sugar allotment and provide a 
normal carryover inventory. If the determination is made that the 
quantity of sugar produced in Louisiana, plus a normal carryover 
inventory, will exceed the State's allotment, CCC will establish for 
each sugarcane producing farm a proportionate share that limits the 
sugarcane acreage that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed.
    (c) For purposes of determining proportionate shares CCC will:
    (1) Establish the State's per-acre yield goal at a level not less 
than the average per-acre yield in the State for the 2 highest years 
from among the 1999 through 2001 crop years;
    (2) Adjust the per-acre yield goal by the State average recovery 
rate;
    (3) Convert the State cane sugar allotment into a State acreage 
allotment by dividing the State allotment by the adjusted per-acre yield 
goal;
    (4) Establish a uniform reduction percentage for the crop by 
dividing the State acreage allotment by the sum of all adjusted acreage 
bases in the State as determined under Sec. 1435.312; and
    (5) Apply the uniform reduction percentage to the acreage base 
established for each sugarcane producing farm in the State to determine 
the farm's proportionate share of sugarcane acreage that may be 
harvested for sugar or seed.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.312  Establishment of acreage bases under proportionate shares.

    (a) CCC will establish a sugarcane crop acreage base for each farm 
subject to proportionate shares as the simple average of the acreage 
planted and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed on the farm 
in the 2 highest of the 1999 through 2001 crop years. Acreage considered 
planted shall be determined under Sec. 1435.315.
    (b) In establishing crop acreage bases, CCC will:
    (1) Not consider acreage prevented from planting, and
    (2) Consider acreage planted to sugarcane that fails.
    (c) In establishing crop acreage bases, CCC will allow producers who 
have not previously reported their sugarcane acreage to do so by a date 
CCC determines and announces. Late-filed acreage reports will be 
accepted as the Deputy Administrator determines appropriate.
    (d) The farm's crop acreage base shall be used to determine the 
farm's proportionate share.
    (e) The regulations at part 718 of this title shall apply to this 
subpart, except reconstitution of farms with a sugar crop acreage base 
shall not be allowed across State lines.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.313  Permanent transfer of acreage base histories under proportionate shares.

    (a) A sugarcane producer on a farm may transfer all or a portion of 
the producer's acreage base history of land owned, operated, or 
controlled to any other farm in the State that the producer owns, 
operates, or controls under the Deputy Administrator-issued 
instructions. The transfer will reduce permanently the transferring 
farm's sugarcane acreage base history and increase the receiving farm's 
crop acreage base.
    (b) All farm owners must agree in writing to the transfer.
    (c) Producers may transfer sugarcane acreage base histories under 
this section by the date the State FSA committee establishes annually.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.314  Temporary transfer of proportionate share due to disasters.

    (a) If, for reasons beyond the control of a producer on a farm, such 
producer is unable to harvest sugarcane acreage relative to all or a 
portion of the proportionate share established for the farm, the 
Secretary may preserve, on producer application and written consent of 
all owners of the farm, for a period of not more than 5 consecutive 
years, the acreage base history of the farm to the extent of the 
proportionate share involved.

[[Page 510]]

    (b) Such proportionate share may be transferred, with the written 
consent of all owners of the farm, for 1 crop year to other farm owners 
or operators subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The acreage base history of the transferring farm will be 
preserved for a period from 1 to 5 years; and
    (2) Acreage base history will not be increased on the receiving 
farm.
    (c) Producers who transfer a proportionate share under this section 
will be required to:
    (1) Initiate the transfer in the county FSA office where the 
proportionate shares are established; and
    (2) Obtain approval from the transferring county FSA committee.
    (d) All transfers made under this section must be completed by the 
date the State FSA committee establishes.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.315  Adjustments to proportionate shares.

    Whenever CCC determines that, because of a natural disaster or other 
condition beyond the control of producers adversely affecting a 
sugarcane crop, the amount of sugarcane produced by producers subject to 
proportionate shares will not be sufficient to enable state processors 
to produce sufficient sugar to meet the State's cane sugar allotment and 
provide a normal carryover of sugar, CCC may uniformly allow producers 
to harvest sugarcane in excess of their proportionate shares, or suspend 
proportionate shares entirely.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.316  Acreage reports for purposes of proportionate shares.

    (a) A report of planted and failed acreage shall be required on 
farms that produce sugarcane for sugar or seed. Such report shall also 
specify the total acreage intended for harvest for sugar and seed.
    (b) The reports required under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
be on forms prescribed by CCC and shall be filed annually with the 
county FSA committee by the applicable final reporting date CCC 
establishes. The farm operator or farm owner shall file such reports.
    (c) Acreage reports will be used to determine compliance with 
proportionate shares and acreage bases for future proportionate shares.
    (d) An acreage report may be accepted after the established date for 
reporting if physical evidence is still available for inspection that 
may be used to make a determination relative to:
    (1) Existence of the crop;
    (2) Use made of the crop;
    (3) Lack of crop; or
    (4) Disaster condition affecting the crop.
    (e) The farm operator shall pay the cost of a farm visit by an 
authorized FSA employee unless the county FSA committee has determined 
that failure to report in a timely manner was beyond the producer's 
control.
    (f) The farm operator may revise an acreage report. Revised reports 
shall be filed in accordance with CCC instructions and shall be accepted 
at any time if:
    (1) Evidence exists for inspection and determination of:
    (i) Existence of the crop;
    (ii) Use made of the crop;
    (iii) Lack of crop; or
    (iv) Disaster condition affecting the crops.
    (2) The farm has not already been inspected and the acreage already 
determined or harvesting of sugarcane already begun.
    (g) Provisions of part 718 of this chapter will apply for field 
inspections, tolerance, and variance. Assessments for false acreage 
reporting will be applied under Sec. 1435.318.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.317  Revisions of allocations and proportionate shares.

    The Executive Vice President, CCC, may modify any processor's 
allocation or any producer's proportionate share on the same basis as 
the initial allocation or proportionate share was required to be 
established.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.318  Penalties and assessments.

    (a) Under Sec. 359b(c)(3) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, as amended, any sugar beet or sugarcane processor who knowingly 
markets sugar or sugar products in excess of the processor's allocation 
in violation of Sec. 1435.307 shall be liable to CCC for a civil penalty 
in an amount equal to 3 times the U.S. market value, at the

[[Page 511]]

time the violation was committed, of that quantity of sugar involved in 
the violation.
    (b) Under Sec. 359f(c)(5) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, as amended, any producer of sugarcane whose farm has a 
proportionate share, and who knowingly harvests or allows to be 
harvested an acreage of sugarcane for sugar or seed in excess of the 
farm's proportionate share shall pay to CCC a civil penalty in an amount 
equal to 1.5 times the U.S. market value of the quantity of sugar that 
is marketed by the processor of such sugarcane in excess of the 
allocation of such processor, for the year in which the violation was 
committed. However, civil penalties will not be assessed when the 
producer harvests acreage for sugar or seed in excess of the farm's 
proportionate share, if the excess sugarcane harvested is:
    (1) Processed by a sugarcane processor that does not exceed its 
marketing allocation; or
    (2) Diverted to a use other than sugar or seed if:
    (i) The sugarcane producer requests and pays for a CCC field 
inspection, and
    (ii) CCC verifies the disposition of the excess harvest is not for 
sugar or seed.
    (c) Any penalty assessed under paragraph (b) of this section shall 
be prorated among the producers of all sugarcane acquired by the 
processor from excess acres.
    (d) Any person filing a false acreage report that exceeds tolerance 
will be subject to an assessment not to exceed $10,000. Whenever the 
failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions 
applicable to proportionate shares would result in an assessment, the 
Deputy Administrator may authorize the waiver or reduction of the 
assessment in such amounts as determined to be equitable about the 
seriousness of the failure, the producer's good-faith effort to comply 
fully with such terms and conditions, and the producer's substantial 
performance.
    (e) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this subpart 
other than paragraph (d) of this section is subject to the assessment of 
a civil penalty by CCC of not more than $5,000 for each violation.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.319  Appeals and arbitration.

    (a) A person adversely affected by any determination made under this 
subpart may request reconsideration of such determination by filing a 
written request with the Executive Vice President, CCC, detailing the 
basis of the request within 10 days of such determination. Such a 
request must be submitted at: Executive Vice President, CCC, Stop 0501, 
1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250-0501.
    (b) For issues arising under Secs. 359d, 359f(b) and (c), and 359(i) 
of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, after completion 
of the process provided in paragraph (a) of this section, a person 
adversely affected by a reconsidered determination may appeal such 
determination by filing a written notice of appeal within 20 days of the 
issuance of the reconsidered determination with the Hearing Clerk, USDA. 
The notice of appeal must be submitted at: Hearing Clerk, USDA, Room 
1081, South Building, 1400 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC, 
20250-9200. Any hearing conducted under this paragraph shall be by the 
Judicial Officer.
    (c) For issues arising under Secs. 359a-359c, 359e, and 359g of the 
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, after completion of the 
process provided in paragraph (a) of this section, a person adversely 
affected by the reconsidered determination may appeal such determination 
by filing a written notice of appeal with the Director, National Appeals 
Division, USDA, as provided in part 11 of this title. For issues arising 
under Sec. 359f(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as 
amended, such disputes shall be resolved through arbitration under the 
direction of the Executive Vice President, CCC. A request for 
arbitration must be filed in writing at the address specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

        Subpart E--Processor Sugar Payment-In-Kind (PIK) Program


<R05>
Sec. 1435.400  General statement.

    This subpart shall be applicable to sugar beet and sugarcane 
processors

[[Page 512]]

throughout the United States who, acting in conjunction with the 
producers of the sugarcane or sugar beets processed by the processors, 
reduce sugar production in return for a payment of sugar from CCC when 
CCC determines that such action will reduce forfeitures of sugar pledged 
as collateral for a CCC loan.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.401  Bid submission procedures.

    (a) After announcement by CCC that a program authorized by this 
subpart is in effect, processors who desire to participate in the 
program must submit a bid to CCC, on a form prescribed by CCC, that 
specifies:
    (1) For a program involving acreage diversion, the amount of acreage 
to be reduced by producers who have contracts for delivery of sugar 
beets or sugar cane to the processor and contains the information CCC 
determines necessary to conduct the program and includes but is not 
limited to:
    (i) The number of acres that the processor, acting in conjunction 
with the producers, will divert;
    (ii) The previous consecutive 3-year simple average sugar beet or 
sugarcane yield on that acreage while under contract (years with no 
production contracted with a producer will not be considered (for first-
time producers, however, the previous consecutive 3-year simple average 
sugar beet or sugarcane yield for all the producers under contract who 
delivered to the applicable factory will be used);
    (iii) The previous 3-year simple average sugar content of the 
producer's beets or sugarcane (for first-time producers, the previous 3-
year simple average sugar content for all beets or cane delivered to 
that factory will be used);
    (iv) The processor's previous 3-year simple average recovery rate 
(for processors that have not been fully operational during the last 3 
years, the simple average for those years that they were fully 
operational);
    (v) The value of CCC sugar to be received as payment; and
    (vi) Other information CCC deems necessary for program 
administration; or
    (2) The sugar production capacity to be removed from production by 
the processor.
    (b) The following acreage is ineligible for enrollment in the PIK 
program:
    (1) If planted, acreage not currently under contract for delivery of 
sugar beets to a sugar beet processor or sugarcane to a sugarcane 
processor for sugar production.
    (2) If planted, acreage that is not harvestable,
    (3) Acreage devoted to roads or other non-producing areas, or
    (4) If planted, acreage on which a crop insurance indemnity or 
replant payment was received for the current crop or for which a claim 
has been, or will be, filed to receive a crop insurance indemnity or 
replant payment for the current crop, except for replant payments for 
acreage actually replanted before the end of the normal planting period.
    (c) If planted, the diverted acres cannot be grazed until after the 
sugar beets or sugarcane are destroyed by disking, plowing, or other 
means of mechanical destruction. In addition, the sugar beets or 
sugarcane on the diverted acres may not be used for any commercial 
purpose.
    (d) The acreage offered must meet the following requirements:
    (1) If less than or equal to 15 acres, then the acreage bid must 
consist of one of the following:
    (i) One contiguous area of land,
    (ii) One or more entire permanent fields, or
    (iii) One or more entire permanent fields and one contiguous area of 
land to complete the balance;
    (2) If more than 15 acres, then the acreage bid must consist of one 
of the following:
    (i) One or more areas of land of at least 15 contiguous acres each 
with one remaining area of land of less than 15 contiguous acres to 
complete the balance,
    (ii) One or more entire permanent fields, or
    (iii) One or more entire permanent fields and one area of contiguous 
land to complete the balance.
    (3) Contiguous areas of land must have a minimum width of 3 chains 
(198 feet).
    (e) For a program involving desugaring capacity, or other measures 
of sugar production, not involving

[[Page 513]]

acreage diversion, the bid must contain the information CCC determine 
necessary to conduct the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.402  Bid selection procedures.

    (a) For bids in which the processor offers to remove acreage of 
sugar beets or sugarcane from production, CCC will rank bids on the 
basis of the bid amount as a percentage of the expected sugar produced 
from the retired acreage. Bids with the lowest of such percentages will 
be selected first. In the case of identical bids, selection may be based 
on random selection or pro rata shares, as CCC deems appropriate.
    (b) CCC will reject bids for which the bid amounts exceed the 
expected sugar produced from the retired acreage.
    (c) For bids in which the processor offers to remove sugar 
production capacity from production, CCC will rank the bids on the basis 
of the capacity to be removed from production.
    (d) All acceptable bids specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
section will be further reviewed by CCC and ranked in order of the 
greatest reduction in sugar program that can be achieved at the lowest 
cost to CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.403  In-kind payments.

    (a) CCC will, through such methods as CCC deems appropriate, make 
payments in the form of sugar held in CCC inventory.
    (b) To the maximum extent practicable, CCC will use its inventory in 
making an in-kind payment based on the following priority:
    (1) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by the processor;
    (2) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by any other processor in the 
same region as the producer;
    (3) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by any other processor that is 
not in the same region as the producer; and
    (4) CCC-owned sugar held in storage anywhere in the United States, 
if CCC determines that such sugar is eligible to be used for in-kind 
payments.
    (c) The value of CCC-owned inventory is dependent upon the storage 
location of the sugar and the type of sugar (raw or refined). CCC will 
announce the value of its inventory before bid solicitation. 
Accordingly, the quantity of sugar CCC will provide in terms of an in-
kind payment to a processor will be determined by dividing:
    (1) The total of the processor's bid amount that CCC accepts, by
    (2) The value of CCC's inventory at the storage location at which 
title will transfer from CCC to the processor.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.404  Timing of distribution of CCC-owned sugar.

    Distribution of sugar from CCC inventory will occur in such manner 
as CCC determines appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.405  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) CCC may permit processors to bid, in lieu of acreage, 
desugarizing capacity or other measures of sugar production as CCC 
determines.
    (b) The contract shall provide for the payment of liquidated damages 
if a processor fails to comply with the obligations specified in the CCC 
production diversion contract.
    (c) CCC will transfer title of the sugar to the processor by 
notifying the processor or assignee that the sugar is available. CCC 
will stop storage payments on this sugar on the date of transfer.

<R05>
Sec. 1436.1  Applicability.

    The regulations of this part provide the terms and conditions under 
which CCC may provide low-cost financing for producers to build or 
upgrade on-farm storage and handling facilities. Because liens and 
security interests related to this activity may be governed by state 
law, CCC may adapt certain procedures relating to those issues that may 
vary between States.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.2  Administration.

    (a) The Farm Storage Facility Loan Program shall be administered 
under the general supervision of the Executive Vice President, CCC or 
designee and shall be carried out in the field by FSA State committees, 
FSA county committees and FSA employees.
    (b) FSA State committees, FSA county committees and FSA employees, 
do not have the authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of 
the regulations of this part.
    (c) The FSA State committee shall take any action required by these 
regulations that has not been taken by the county committee. The FSA 
State committee shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require the FSA county committee to correct, any 
action taken by such FSA county committee that is not in accordance with 
the regulations of this part; and
    (2) Require the FSA county committee to withhold taking any action 
that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part.
    (d) No provision or delegation herein to a State or FSA county 
committee shall preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a 
designee, or the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining any 
question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any 
determination made by the State or FSA county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize 
State and FSA county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other 
program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such 
other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the Farm 
Storage Facility Loan Program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute Farm Storage Facility Loan 
Program applications and related documents only under the terms and 
conditions determined and announced by CCC. Any such document that is 
not executed in accordance with such terms and conditions, including any 
purported execution prior to the date authorized by CCC, shall be void.
    (g) The Deputy Administrator may suspend this program at any time 
when it appears that there is no shortage of storage that needs to be 
addressed or where some other reason shall arise for which it appears 
that the program goals can be achieved more efficiently in a manner 
different from that provided for in this rule.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.3  Definitions.

    The following definitions shall be applicable to the program 
authorized by this part and will be used in all aspects of administering 
this program:
    Aggregate outstanding balance means the sum of the outstanding 
balances of all loans disbursed under this part to each borrower signing 
the note and security agreement.
    Assumption means the act or agreement by which one borrower takes

shall not be economically significant.
    Facility loan commodity means wheat, rice, raw or refined sugar, 
soybeans, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, safflower, flaxseed, mustard 
seed, other oilseeds as determined and announced by CCC, dry peas, 
lentils, small chickpeas, harvested as whole grain and including 
peanuts, except that corn, grain sorghum, oats, wheat, or barley

[[Page 515]]

shall be included whether harvested as whole grain or other than whole 
grain.
    Financing statement means the appropriate document that gives legal 
notice of a security interest in personal property when properly filed 
or recorded.

applicant's share of the acres farmed for each facility loan commodity 
requiring storage at the proposed facility multiplied by a yield 
determined reasonable by the county committee, multiplied by two, less 
existing storage capacity. If acreage data is not available, including 
prevented planted acres, or the data is not applicable to the storage 
need, a reasonable acreage projection may be made for newly acquired 
farms, changes in cropping operations, or for facility loan commodity 
crops being grown for the first time.
    (2) For sugar-related loans, a projection from the processor of the 
processing volume, available storage capacity, volume not to be marketed 
due to marketing allotments, and other factors affecting the processor's 
storage need, as appropriate. CCC shall determine if the storage need is 
reasonable using data such as past processing volume and marketing 
allotments.
    Subordination agreement means any agreement under which a party may 
subordinate a security interest in property to the interest of another 
party.
    Uniform Commercial Code means the laws generally known by that name

Sec. 1436.7  Loan term.

    The maximum term of the loan shall be 7 years from the date a 
promissory note and security agreement are executed, except in the case 
of a sugar-related loan in which case CCC, at its discretion, may 
authorize a loan of 15 years. The minimum term of a sugar-related loan 
is 7 years. No extensions of the loan term will be granted. The loan 
balance and all related costs are due 7 years from the date of the

<R05>
Sec. 1436.8  Security for loan.

    (a) Except as agreed to by CCC, all loans shall be secured by a 
promissory note and security agreement covering the farm storage 
facility. The promissory note and security agreement shall grant CCC a 
security interest in the collateral and shall be perfected in the manner 
specified in the laws of the state where the collateral is located. 
CCC's security interest in the collateral shall constitute the sole 
security interest in such collateral except for prior liens on the 
underlying realty that by operation of law attach to the collateral if 
it is or will become a fixture. If any such prior lien on the realty 
will attach to the collateral, a severance agreement must be obtained in 
writing from each holder of such a lien, including all government or 
USDA agencies. No additional liens or encumbrances may be placed on the 
storage facility after the loan is approved unless CCC approves 
otherwise in writing.
    (b) For loan amounts exceeding $50,000, or where the aggregate 
outstanding loan balance will exceed $50,000 or for loans where the 
approving committee determines as a result of financial analysis that 
additional security is required, a lien on the real estate parcel on 
which the farm storage facility is located will be required in the form 
of a real estate mortgage, deed of trust, or other security instrument 
approved by the United States Department of Agriculture's Office of 
General Counsel. CCC's interest in the real estate shall be superior to 
all other liens and is the first lien that secures the amount of the 
loan. A loan will be considered to be adequately secured when the real 
estate security for the loan is at least equal to the loan amount. If 
the real estate is covered by a prior lien, a lien waiver may be 
obtained by means of a subordination agreement approved for use in the 
State by USDA's Office of General Counsel. CCC will not require such an 
agreement from any agency of the Department of Agriculture. Loans may be 
secured by a junior lien on real estate when the loan is adequately 
secured and a severance agreement is obtained from prior lien holders.
    (c) Title insurance or a title opinion is required for loans secured 
by real estate.
    (d) Real estate liens may cover land separate from the collateral if 
a lien on the underlying real estate is not feasible and if:
    (1) The borrower owns the separate acreage; and
    (2) the acreage has sufficient value based on the fair market value 
of the acreage at the time of the application as determined by the 
county committee, to insure repayment of the loan.
    (e) Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this section, a 
borrower, in lieu of such liens as are otherwise required by those 
subsections, may provide a letter of credit, bond, or other form of 
security, as approved by CCC.
    (f) If an existing structure is remodeled and an addition becomes an 
attached, integral part of the existing

[[Page 519]]

storage structure, CCC's security interest shall include the existing 
storage structure.
    (g) The cost of loan closings by attorneys, title opinions, title 
insurance, title searches, filing and recording all real estate liens, 
fixture filings and later subordinations will be paid by the borrower. 
CCC shall pay such costs relating to credit reports, collateral lien 
searches, and filing and recording financing statements for the 
collateral.
    (h) For sugar-related facility loans, in addition to the above 
requirements, additional security, including real estate, chattels, 
crops in storage, and other assets owned by the applicant, is required 
if necessary to adequately secure the loan. A sugar-related loan will be 
considered to be adequately secured when the CCC determined value of 
security for the loan is at least equal to 125 percent of the loan 
amount.
    (i) For sugar-related facility loans, paragraph (g) is not 
applicable. The borrower shall pay all loan making fees and closing 
costs. This includes, but is not limited to, attorney fees for loan 
closings, environmental assessments and studies, chattel and real estate 
appraisals, title opinions, title insurance, title searches, filing and 
recording all real estate liens, fixture filings, subordinations, credit 
reports, collateral lien searches, and filing and recording financing 
statements for the collateral.

Sec. 1436.9  Loan amount and loan application approvals.

    (a) The cost on which the loan shall be based is the net cost of the 
eligible facility, accessories, and services to the applicant after 
discounts and rebates, not to exceed a maximum per-bushel cost 
established by the FSA State committee.
    (b) The net cost for storage facilities and handling equipment may 
include the following: all real estate lien related fees paid by the 
borrower, including attorney fees, except for filing fees, environmental 
and historic review fees including archaeological study fees, the 
facility purchase price, sales tax, shipping, delivery charges, site 
preparation costs, installation cost, material and labor for concrete 
pads and foundations, material and labor for electrical wiring, 
electrical motors, off-farm paid labor, on farm site preparation and 
construction equipment costs not to exceed commercial rates approved by 
the county committee, and new on-farm material approved by the county 
committee. The net cost shall not include secondhand material or any 
other item that is determined by the approving authority to be 
ineligible for loan.
    (c) The maximum principal amount of any farm storage facility loan 
shall be 85 percent of the net cost of the applicant's needed storage or 
handling equipment not to exceed $100,000 for each borrower signing the 
note and security agreement. Unless otherwise approved by CCC, borrowers 
shall be considered to be separate persons or borrowers for purposes of 
applying the preceding sentence only to the extent that they would 
normally be considered a separate person under the rules set out in 7 
CFR part 1400.
    (d) The aggregate outstanding balance of all facility loans for any 
one borrower signing the note and security agreement may not exceed 
$100,000.
    (e) When a storage structure has a larger capacity than the 
applicant's needed capacity, as determined by CCC, the net cost eligible 
for a loan shall be prorated. Only costs associated with the applicant's 
needed storage capacity will be considered eligible for loan under this 
part.
    (f) When a flat storage structure has space that is not used 
primarily for facility loan commodity storage, such as office space, the 
loan amount shall be adjusted for the ineligible space as determined by 
CCC.
    (g) The FSA county committee may approve applications, if loan funds 
are available, up to the maximum approval amount unless the FSA State 
committee establishes a lower limit for county committee approval 
authority.
    (h) Farm storage facility loan approvals will expire in 4 months 
after the date of approval unless extended in writing for an additional 
4 months by the FSA State Committee. Sugar storage facility loan 
approvals will expire in 8 months after the date of approval

[[Page 520]]

unless extended in writing for an additional 4 months by the FSA State 
Committee.
    (i) CCC may at any time refuse to make new loans.
    (j) For sugar-related facility loans, paragraphs (c) and (d) and (g) 
do not apply.
    (k) For sugar-related facility loans, the Agency approval officials 
may only approve loans, subject to available funds.

Sec. 1436.10  Down payment.

    (a) A minimum down payment representing the difference between the 
net cost of the storage facility and the amount of the loan determined 
in accordance with Sec. 1436.9 shall be made by the loan applicant to 
the supplier or contractor before the loan is disbursed.
    (b) The down payment shall be in cash unless some other form of 
payment is approved by CCC. The down payment may be obtained by the 
borrower from another lending source.
    (c) The down payment may not include any trade-in, discount, rebate, 
credit, deferred payment, post-dated check, or promissory note to the 
supplier or contractor.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.11  Disbursement and assignments.

    (a) Disbursement of the loan by CCC will be made after the farm 
storage facility has been delivered, erected, constructed, assembled, or 
installed and a CCC representative has inspected and approved such 
facility.
    (b) Disbursement will be made only if the borrower furnishes 
satisfactory evidence of the total cost of the facility and payment of 
all debts on the facility in excess of the amount of the loan.
    (c) Disbursement may be made jointly to the borrower and the 
contractor or supplier, except disbursement may be made to the borrower 
only if CCC determines the borrower has paid the contractor or supplier 
all amounts that are due and owing with respect to the facility and that 
all applicable liens, security interests, or other encumbrances have 
been released.
    (d) A release of liability will be required from contractors and 
suppliers providing goods and services to the loan applicant.
    (e) Loan proceeds cannot be assigned.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.12  Interest and fees.

    (a) Loans shall bear interest at the rate equivalent, as determined 
by CCC, to the rate of interest charged on Treasury securities of 
comparable maturity on the date the loan is approved.
    (b) The interest rate for each loan will remain in effect for the 
term of the loan.
    (c) The loan applicant shall pay a non-refundable application fee in 
such amount determined appropriate by CCC, which fee may not in any case

<R05>
Sec. 1436.13  Loan installments, delinquency, and acceleration of maturity date.

    (a) Equal installments of principal plus interest will be amortized 
over the loan term for purposes of setting a payment schedule. 
Installments are due and payable not later than the last day of each 12-
month period of the loan, until the principal plus interest has been 
paid in full.
    (b) Each installment may be paid in cash, money order, wire 
transfer, or by personal, certified, or cashier's check. Repayment shall 
be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal.
    (c) The following actions will be taken when installments are not 
paid on the due date: A demand for payment shall be mailed to the debtor 
after the due date has passed. If the installment is not paid within 30 
days of the due date or if a new due date acceptable to CCC has not been 
established based on a financial plan submitted by the debtor, the 
initial demand may be followed by two subsequent written demands at 
approximately 30-day intervals unless other action is needed to protect 
the interests of CCC. If the debtor files an appeal according to 
Sec. 1436.18 of this part, collection action shall cease until the 
appeal process is complete, however, any payments due the debtor may be 
withheld and, depending on the outcome of the appeal, may later be 
offset

[[Page 521]]

and applied to reduce the indebtedness. In lieu of a foreclosure on the 
collateral in the case of a delinquency, CCC may permit a rescheduling 
of the debt or other measures consistent with the collection of other 
debts under the provisions of Part 1403. Alternately, CCC may implement 
such other collection procedures as it deems appropriate.
    (d) A claim shall be established against a borrower for any amounts 
remaining due after liquidation of the loan.
    (e) CCC may declare the entire indebtedness immediately due and 
payable if the borrower violates any of the terms and conditions of this 
part, fails to pay any installment on time, or breaches any of the terms 
and conditions of any of the instruments executed in connection with the 
loan, or if , during the life of the loan, the collateral is used in 
connection with or by any unauthorized commercial operation including, 
but not limited to, elevators, warehouses, dryers or processing plants.
    (f) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be 
taken:
    (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity 
that the borrower participates in, either directly or indirectly, as 
determined by CCC.
    (2) Against related persons or entities, irrespective of the debtors 
share, when CCC determines that the debtor has established an entity, or 
reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other manner, 
their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the debt.
    (g) The loan may be paid in full or in part without penalty at any 
time before maturity.
    (h) Upon payment of a loan, CCC shall release CCC's security 
interest in the collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.14  Taxes.

    The borrower must pay, when due, all real and personal property 
taxes that may affect CCC's security interest in all collateral securing 
the note evidencing the loan. To protect its interests, CCC may pay any 
unpaid taxes with respect to the collateral securing a loan made in 
accordance with this part, and if CCC does so, the borrower shall 
reimburse CCC for such payment, and if unpaid by the borrower, such debt 
shall become due immediately.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.15  Maintenance, liability, insurance, and inspections.

    (a) The borrower must maintain the loan collateral in a condition 
suitable for the storage of one or more of the facility loan 
commodities. For purpose of this section the term ``loan collateral'' 
shall mean any property of any kind that was built or improved, or 
acquired using a loan made under this part.
    (b) Until the loan has been repaid, the borrower shall be liable for 
all damages to or destruction of the loan collateral. CCC shall not 
assume any loss of the loan collateral.
    (c) CCC may conduct annual collateral inspections to insure 
compliance with this part. The borrower must consent to such inspection 
as a term of the loan and failure to supply such access shall put the 
borrower into default.
    (d) Structures must be insured against all perils in all cases and 
must also be insured against flooding if the structure is located in a 
flood plain, as determined by CCC. Proof of flood insurance, if 
required, and proof of all peril structural insurance, must be provided 
to CCC annually. CCC must be listed as a loss payee on all peril and 
flood insurance policies.
    (e) CCC shall have rights of ingress and egress where the facility 
is located. Failure of the borrower to secure such access will render a 
borrower ineligible for the loan and, if a loan has already been made 
shall constitute a loan default for which the remaining balance of the 
loan shall become immediately due and payable.
    (f) For sugar-related loans, in addition to the requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section, sugar processors shall also insure the 
contents of storage structures used as collateral for a sugar-related 
facility loan against all perils.

acceptable to CCC, CCC may call the loan and initiate foreclosure 
proceedings by issuing a liquidation letter to the borrower.
    (2) The debtor may voluntarily agree to allow removal of the 
collateral to facilitate sale by signing an agreement for sale. If the 
debtor objects to removal of collateral, the law of the state where the 
collateral exists will be used to foreclose on the property.
    (3) For loans with movable collateral and no real estate lien, CCC 
may sell the collateral for the best price obtainable. Sales proceeds 
shall be distributed in the following order:
    (i) To CCC to satisfy the debtor's indebtedness including all costs 
associated with selling the collateral.
    (ii) Payment to junior lien holders if approved by USDA's Office of 
the General Counsel and then to the borrower or other persons as 
determined appropriate by that office.
    (4) For loans with nonmovable collateral, as determined by CCC, and 
no real estate lien, CCC may establish a claim according to 7 CFR part 
1403.
    (5) For loans secured with a real estate lien, CCC may obtain an 
appraisal of the property. Sales proceeds shall be distributed in the 
following order:
    (i) To CCC to satisfy the debtor's indebtedness including all costs 
associated with selling the collateral and the appraisal.
    (ii) To junior lien holders if approved by USDA's Office of the 
General Counsel; or
    (iii) To the borrower or other persons as determined appropriate by 
that office.
    (b) Assumption by another borrower of a farm storage facility loan 
is permitted subject to county committee approval and the subsequent 
borrower's ability to show a satisfactory credit history. An assumption 
of the loan may be approved when the collateral is sold by CCC to an 
otherwise eligible borrower, the current borrower will convey the 
collateral or property securing the loan to another eligible borrower, 
or the borrower is dead, incompetent, or missing and an eligible 
borrower wants to assume the loan.
    (1) Requests for approval of assumptions shall be made to the county 
committee by the borrower, the borrower's successors, or representatives 
of the borrower. If approval is granted, the borrower's successors or 
representatives shall execute a new farm storage facility note and 
security agreement for the balance of the term of the loan.
    (2) The principal amount of the loan shall include the unpaid amount 
of the loan, interest computed to the date of assumption, all past due 
installments, and any other charges that may be required.
    (c) The borrower may voluntarily convey the collateral to CCC before 
repaying the loan. Before a borrower sells or conveys the facilities or 
other property securing a loan without repaying the loan in full, the 
borrower shall obtain approval for the sale or conveyance from the FSA 
county committee with the understanding that sale proceeds shall be paid 
to satisfy the borrowers indebtedness to CCC.
    (d) Remedies provided for in this section shall, unless CCC 
determines otherwise, be subject to the administrative appeals provided 
for elsewhere in this part, including those that are found at 
Sec. 1436.13.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.17  Environmental compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise specified in this section, prior to approval 
of any farm storage facility loan, an environmental evaluation will be 
completed to determine if the proposed action will have any adverse 
impacts on the environment and cultural resources.
    (b) If it is determined that a proposed action or group of proposed 
actions will not result in any adverse impact, the action will be 
considered as being categorically excluded for the purpose of compliance 
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 40 CFR parts 1500-
1508.
    (c)(1) If adverse environmental impacts (either direct or indirect) 
are identified, an environmental assessment will be completed in 
accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's Regulations for 
Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA.

[[Page 523]]

    (2) The environmental assessment will be used to develop an action 
that results in no significant environmental impact on the human 
environment or cultural resources.
    (3) No action will be approved that has been determined to have 
significant impacts on the human environment or cultural resources.
    (d)(1) In order to minimize the exposure to environmental 
liabilities from the presence of contamination on real estate 
collateral, an evaluation will be made of the economic and environmental 
risks to the real estate collateral posed by the presence of hazardous 
substances and petroleum products.
    (2) If the evaluation made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
reveals that the collateral is or may be contaminated, then the 
applicant will be notified and given an option of offering as collateral 
other real estate that is free from contamination or remediating the 
contamination on the original site offered as collateral.

any person to be subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, 
religion, color, national origin, gender, or other prohibited basis. 
Borrowers must comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations 
regarding equal opportunity in hiring, procurement, and related matters.
    (b) With respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, CCC will not 
discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, color,

basis of whether all or a part of the applicant's income derives from 
any public assistance program, or whether the applicant in good faith, 
exercises any rights under the Consumer Protection Act.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1437.1  Applicability.

    (a) The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) is 
intended to provide eligible producers of eligible crops coverage 
equivalent to the catastrophic risk protection level of crop insurance. 
NAP is designed to help reduce production risks faced by producers of 
commercial crops or other agricultural commodities. NAP will reduce 
financial losses that occur when natural disasters cause a catastrophic 
loss of production or where producers are prevented from planting an 
eligible crop.
    (b) The provisions contained in this part are applicable to eligible 
producers and eligible crops for which catastrophic coverage under 
section 508(b) the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(b)), as 
amended, or its successors, is not available.
    (c) The regulations of this part are applicable to the 2001 and 
subsequent crop years.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.2  Administration.

    (a) NAP is administered under the general supervision of the 
Executive Vice-President, CCC (who also serves as Administrator, Farm 
Service Agency), and shall be carried out by State and county FSA 
committees (State and county committees).
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and their 
employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any of the 
provisions of the regulations of this part.
    (c) The State committee shall take any action required by the 
regulations of this part that the county committee has not taken. The 
State committee shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the 
regulations of this part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice-President, CCC, or a designee, from 
determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or 
modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines (except statutory deadlines) in 
cases where lateness to file does not adversely affect operation of the 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.3  Definitions.

    The definitions and program parameters set out in this section shall 
be applicable for all purposes of administering the Noninsured Crop 
Disaster Assistance Program provided for in this part. Although the 
terms defined in part 718 of this title and part 1400 of this chapter 
shall also be applicable, the definitions set forth in this section 
shall govern for all purposes of administering the Program.
    Actual Production History (APH) means the farm's operative 
production history established in accordance with subpart B of this 
part.
    Administrative county office means the county FSA office designated 
to make determinations, handle official records, and issue payments for 
the producer in accordance with 7 CFR part 718.
    Animal Unit Days (AUD) means an expression of expected or actual 
stocking rate for pasture or forage.
    Application Closing Date means the last date, as determined by CCC, 
producers can submit an application for coverage for noninsured crops 
for the specified crop year.
    Catastrophic coverage means a catastrophic risk protection (CAT) 
level of crop insurance available in accordance

[[Page 525]]

with section 508(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended.
    Catastrophic loss means--
    (1) Loss, as the result of an eligible cause of loss, that entails 
as determined by CCC:
    (i) Prevented planting of greater than 35 percent of the intended 
crop acreage; a yield loss of greater than 50 percent of the approved 
yield; or value loss of greater than 50 percent of the pre-disaster 
value; or
    (ii) AUD loss of greater than 50 percent of the expected AUD.
    (2)The quantity will not be reduced for any quality consideration 
unless a zero value is established.
    Controlled environment means, with respect to those crops for which 
a controlled environment is expected to be provided, including but not 
limited to ornamental nursery, aquaculture (including ornamental fish), 
and floriculture, an environment in which everything that can 
practicably be controlled with structures, facilities, growing media 
(including but not limited to water, soil, or nutrients) by the 
producer, is in fact controlled by the producer.
    Crop year means the calendar year in which the crop is normally 
harvested or in which the majority of the crop would have been 
harvested. For value loss and other specific commodities, see the 
applicable subpart and section of this part. For crops for which 
catastrophic coverage is available, the crop year will be as defined by 
such coverage.
    Fiber means a slender and greatly elongated natural plant filament, 
e.g. cotton, flax, etc. used in manufacturing, as determined by CCC.
    Final planting date means the date which marks the end of the 
planting period for the crop and in particular the last day, as 
determined by CCC, the crop can be planted to reasonably expect to 
achieve 100 percent of the expected yield in the intended harvest year 
or planting period.
    Food means a material consisting essentially of protein, 
carbohydrates, and fat used in the body to sustain growth, repair, and 
vital processes including the crops used for the preparation of food, as 
determined by CCC.
    Good farming practices means the cultural practices generally used 
for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and produce at 
least the individual unit approved yield. These practices are normally 
those recognized by Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension 
Service as compatible with agronomic and weather conditions.
    Harvested means the producer has removed the crop from the field by 
hand, mechanically, or by grazing of livestock. The crop is considered 
harvested once it is removed from the field and placed in a truck or 
other conveyance or is consumed through the act of grazing. Crops 
normally placed in a truck or other conveyance and taken off the crop 
acreage, such as hay are considered harvested when in the bale, whether 
removed from the field or not.
    Industrial crop means a commercial crop, or other agricultural 
commodity utilized in manufacturing. Industrial crops include caster 
beans, chia, crambe, crotalaria, cuphea, guar, guayule, hesperaloe, 
kenaf, lesquerella, meadowfoam, milkweed, plantago, ovato, sesame and 
other crops specifically designated by CCC.
    Intended Use means for a crop or a commodity, the end use for which 
it is grown and produced.
    Multiple planted means the same crop is planted and harvested during 
two or more distinct planting periods in the same crop year, as 
determined by CCC.
    Normal harvest date means the date harvest of the crop is normally 
completed in the administrative county, as determined by CCC.
    Seed crop means propagation stock commercially produced for sale as 
seed stock for eligible crops.
    Seeded forage means forage on acreage mechanically seeded with 
forage vegetation at regular intervals, at least every 7 years, in 
accordance with good farming practices.
    T-Yield means the yield which is based on the county expected yield 
of the crop for the crop year and is used on an adjusted or unadjusted 
basis to calculate the approved yield for crops covered under the NAP 
when less than four years of actual, assigned, or appraised yields are 
available in the APH data base.

[[Page 526]]

    Transitional yield means an estimated yield of that name provided in 
the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) actuarial table which is 
used to calculate an average/approved APH yield for crops insured under 
the Federal Crop Insurance Act when less than four years of actual, 
temporary, and/or assigned yields are available on a crop by county 
basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.4  Eligibility.

    (a) Noninsured crop disaster assistance for low yield or prevented 
planting is available to producers of eligible commercial crops or other 
agricultural commodities, as determined by CCC, for which:
    (1) Catastrophic coverage is not available; or
    (2) Catastrophic coverage is available in the administrative county, 
however, the eligible commercial crop or other agricultural commodity is 
affected by an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC, that is not 
covered by the catastrophic coverage.
    (b) Noninsured crop disaster assistance for low yields or prevented 
planting is available only when loss of the crop occurs as a result of 
an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC.

State-owned lands is available only for seeded forage.
    (3) Any commercial crop grown for fiber, excluding trees grown for 
wood, paper, or pulp products; and
    (4) Any commercial production of:
    (i) Aquacultural species (including ornamental fish);
    (ii) Floricultural crops;
    (iii) Ornamental nursery plants;

[67 FR 12448, Mar. 19, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 62324, Oct. 7, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1437.5  Coverage period.

    (a) The coverage period is the time during which coverage is 
available against loss of production of the eligible crop as a result of 
natural disaster.
    (b) The coverage period for annual crops, including annual forage 
crops, begins the later of 30 calendar days after the date the 
application for coverage is filed; or the date the crop is planted, not 
to exceed the final planting date; and ends on the earlier of the date 
harvest is complete; the normal harvest date of the crop in the area; 
the date the crop is abandoned; or the date the crop is destroyed.
    (c) Except as otherwise specified in this part, the coverage period 
for biennial and perennial crops begins 30 calendar days after the 
application closing date; and ends as determined by CCC.
    (d) Except as otherwise specified in this part, the coverage period 
for value loss crops, including ornamental nursery, aquaculture, 
Christmas tree crops, ginseng, and turfgrass sod; and other eligible 
crops, including floriculture and mushrooms begins 30 calendar days 
after the application closing date; and ends the last day of the crop 
year, as determined by CCC.
    (e) The coverage period for honey begins 30 calendar days after the 
application closing date and ends the last day of the crop year, as 
determined by CCC.
    (f) The coverage period for maple sap begins 30 calendar days after 
the application closing date and ends on the earlier of the date harvest 
is complete; or the normal harvest date.
    (g) For biennial and perennial forage crops the coverage period 
begins the later of 30 calendar days after the application closing date; 
for first year seedings, the date the crop was planted; or the date 
following the normal harvest date. The coverage ends on the normal 
harvest date of the subsequent year.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.6  Application for coverage and service fee.

    (a) With respect to each crop, commodity or acreage, producers must 
file

[[Page 527]]

an application for coverage under this part no later than the 
application closing date.
    (b) The service fee must be paid at the time of the application. The 
service fee is $100 per crop per administrative county, up to $300 per 
producer per administrative county, but not to exceed $900 per producer.
    (c) The service fee will be applied per administrative county by 
crop definition and planting period, as determined by CCC.
    (d) Limited resource farmers may request that the service fee be 
waived and must request such a waiver prior to, or at the same time the 
application for coverage is filed. For this purpose, a ``limited 
resource farmer'' shall be given the meaning assigned by 7 CFR 457.8.
    (e) For 2001 and 2002 crops for which the application closing date 
would normally have been established prior to March 19, 2002, or 
established within 60 calendar days after March 19, 2002, producers must 
within 30 calendar days after March 19, 2002:
    (1) Submit a 2001 or 2002 crop application for coverage, as 
applicable, and pay the applicable service fee; and
    (2) Certify the 2000 and 2001 crop year production for the crop, if 
applicable.
    (f) For 2001 and 2002 crops which have suffered damage or loss, 
producers must, in addition to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, have 
complied with all requirements of this part prior to its revision on 
March 19, 2002, (and contained in the 7 CFR, parts 1200 to 1599, edition 
revised as of January 1, 2002) including having filed a timely:
    (1) Report of acreage;
    (2) Notice of loss; and
    (3) Application for payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.7  Records.

    (a) Producers must maintain records of crop acreage, acreage yields, 
and production for the crop for which an application for coverage is 
filed in accordance with Sec. 1437.5. For those crops or commodities for 
which it is impractical, as determined by CCC, to maintain crop acreage, 
yields or production, producers must maintain records, in addition to 
the available records required by this section, as may be required in 
subparts C, D and E, of this part. Producers must retain records of the 
production and acreage yield for a minimum of 3 years for each crop for 
which an application for coverage is filed in accordance with 
Sec. 1437.6. Producers may be selected on a random or targeted basis and 
be required to provide records acceptable to CCC to support the 
certification provided. For each crop for which producers file an 
application for payment in accordance with Sec. 1437.10 that is 
harvested, producers must provide documentary evidence of production, 
acceptable to CCC, and the date harvest was completed. Such documentary 
evidence must be filed not later than the application closing date for 
the crop in the subsequent crop year. Records of a previous crop year's 
production for inclusion in the actual production history database used 
to calculate an approved yield for the current crop year must be 
certified by the producer no later than the application closing date for 
the crop in the current crop year. Production data provided after the 
application closing date in the current crop year for the crop may be 
included in the actual production history data base for the calculation 
of subsequent approved yield calculations if accompanied by acceptable 
records of production as determined by CCC. Records of production 
acceptable to CCC may include:
    (1) Commercial receipts, settlement sheets, warehouse ledger sheets, 
or load summaries if the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of 
through commercial channels provided the records are reliable or 
verifiable as determined by CCC; and
    (2) Such documentary evidence such as contemporaneous measurements, 
truck scale tickets, and contemporaneous diaries, as is necessary in 
order to verify the information provided if the eligible crop has been 
fed to livestock, or otherwise disposed of other than through commercial 
channels, provided the records are reliable or verifiable as determined 
by CCC. If the crop will be disposed of through retail sales, such as: 
roadside stands, u-pick, etc. and the producer will not be able to 
certify acceptable records of production, the producer must request an 
appraisal of the unit acreage prior to harvest of the crop acreage.

[[Page 528]]

    (b) Producers must provide verifiable evidence, as determined by 
CCC, of:
    (1) An interest in the commodity produced or control of the crop 
acreage on which the commodity was grown at the time of disaster; and
    (2) The authority of the applicable individual to execute program 
documents.
    (c) Reports of acreage planted or intended but prevented from being 
planted must be provided to CCC at the administrative FSA office for the 
acreage no later than the date specified by CCC for each crop and 
location. Reports of acreage filed beyond the date specified by CCC for 
the crop and location may, however, be considered timely filed if all 
the provisions of 7 CFR 718.103 are met. In the case of a crop-share 
arrangement, all producers will be bound by the acreage report filed by 
the landowner or operator unless the producer files a separate acreage 
report prior to the date specified by CCC for the crop and location. 
Reports of acreage planted or intended and prevented from being planted 
must include all of the following information:
    (1) Number of acres of the eligible crop in the administrative 
county (for each planting in the event of multiple planting) in which 
the producer has a share;
    (2) Zero acres planted when the producer's crop for which an 
application for coverage was filed, is not planted;
    (3) The producer's share of the eligible crop at the time an 
application for coverage was filed;
    (4) The FSA farm serial number;
    (5) The identity of the crop, practices, intended uses, and for 
forage crops, the predominant species or type and variety of the 
vegetation;
    (6) The identity of all producers sharing in the crop;
    (7) The date the crop was planted or planting was completed, 
including the age of the perennial crops; and
    (8) The acreage intended but prevented from being planted.
    (d) Producers receiving a guaranteed payment for planted acreage, as 
opposed to receiving a payment only upon delivery of the production must 
provide documentation of any written or verbal contract or arrangement 
with the buyer to CCC. Net production, as determined by CCC, may be 
adjusted upward by the amount of production corresponding to the amount 
of the contract payment received.
    (e) Producers must provide documentation of any salvage value 
received by or made available for the quantity of the crop or commodity 
that cannot be marketed or sold in any market, as determined by CCC and 
any value received by or made available for a secondary use of the crop 
or commodity.
    (f) Producers requesting payment under this part must maintain 
records which substantiate gross revenue for the tax year preceding the 
crop year for which coverage is requested.
    (g) Producers requesting a waiver of service fees as a limited 
resource producer must maintain records which substantiate annual gross 
income for the two tax years preceding the crop year for which coverage 
is requested.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.8  Unit division.

    Except as determined by CCC, a unit shall be all acreage of the 
eligible crop in the administrative county operated by the same 
producer(s). In cases where the owners of land are also producers, units 
shall be further divided based on ownership interest of the land.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.9  Causes of loss.

    (a) To be eligible for benefits under this part, crops must be 
damaged or prevented from being planted by drought, flood or other 
natural disasters and conditions related thereto. Not all named perils 
are eligible causes of loss for all crops. Eligible causes of loss 
include:
    (1) Damaging weather occurring prior to or during harvest, including 
but not limited to drought, hail, excessive moisture, freeze, tornado, 
hurricane, excessive wind, or any combination thereof;
    (2) Adverse natural occurrence occurring prior to or during harvest, 
such as earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption; and
    (3) A related condition, including but not limited to heat, insect 
infestation, or disease, which occurs as a result of an adverse natural 
occurrence or damaging weather occurring prior to or during harvest, 
that directly causes,

[[Page 529]]

accelerates, or exacerbates the destruction or deterioration of an 
eligible crop, as determined by the Secretary.
    (b) Ineligible causes of loss include but are not limited to:
    (1) Factors or circumstances that are not the result of an eligible 
cause of loss affecting specific crop or commodity;
    (2) The negligence or malfeasance of the producer;
    (3) The failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop in those 
areas and under such circumstances where it is customary to reseed;
    (4) Failure of the producer to follow good farming practices, as 
determined by CCC;
    (5) Water contained or released by any governmental, public, or 
private dam or reservoir project, if an easement exists on the acreage 
affected for the containment or release of the water;
    (6) Failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities; or
    (7) Except for tree crops and perennials, inadequate irrigation 
resources at the beginning of the crop year;
    (8) A loss of inventory (or yield as applicable) of aquiculture 
(including ornamental fish), floriculture or ornamental nursery stemming 
from drought or any failure to provide water, soil, or growing media to 
such crop for any reason;
    (9) Any failure to provide a controlled environment or exercise good 
nursery practices where such controlled environment or practices are a 
condition of eligibility under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.10  Notice of loss and application for payment.

    (a) At least one producer having a share in the unit must provide a 
notice of loss to CCC in the administrative FSA office for the unit, 
within:
    (1) For prevented planting claims, 15 calendar days after the final 
planting date,
    (2) For low yield claims and allowable value loss, the earlier of:
    (i) 15 calendar days after the damaging weather or adverse natural 
occurrence, or date loss of the crop or commodity becomes apparent for 
low yield claims; and
    (ii) 15 calendar days after the normal harvest date.
    (b) For each crop for which a notice of loss is filed, producers 
must provide the following information:
    (1) Crop by type or variety, as applicable;
    (2) The cause of the crop damage;
    (3) Date the loss occurred, as applicable;
    (4) Date the damage or loss became apparent;
    (5) The existence of a guaranteed payment through a contract or 
agreement for planted acreage as opposed to delivery of production, if 
one exists;
    (6) Type of crop loss occurred, e.g. prevented planting or low 
yield;
    (7) Practices employed to grow the crop, e.g. irrigated or non-
irrigated;
    (8) For prevented planting:
    (i) Total acreage intended to be planted to the crop in the 
administrative county;
    (ii) Total acreage planted by the producer to the crop in the 
administrative county;
    (iii) Whether a purchase, delivery, or arrangement for purchase or 
delivery was made for seed, chemicals, fertilizer, etc; and
    (iv) What and when land preparation measures, e.g. cultivation, etc. 
were completed and indicate what has been done or will be done with the 
acreage, e.g. abandoned, replanted, etc.
    (9) For low yield:
    (i) Total acreage planted by the producer to the crop in the 
administrative county;
    (ii) Total acreage of the crop in the administrative county 
affected;
    (iii) What and when land preparation measures and practices, e.g. 
cultivation, planting, irrigated, etc. were completed before and after 
the loss; and
    (iv) What will be done with the affected crop acreage, e.g. 
harvested, destroyed and replanted to a different crop, abandoned, etc.
    (10) Any such other information requested by CCC to establish the 
loss.
    (c) A notice of loss provided beyond the time specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section may be considered timely filed if, at the discretion 
of CCC, provided at such time to permit an authorized CCC representative 
the opportunity to:

[[Page 530]]

    (1) Verify the information on the notice of loss by inspection of 
the specific acreage or crop involved; and
    (2) Determine, based on information obtained by inspection of the 
specific acreage or crop involved, that an eligible cause of loss, as 
opposed to other circumstance, caused the claimed damage or loss.
    (d) Crop acreage that will not be harvested, i.e. acreage that is to 
be abandoned or destroyed or in the case of forage acreage intended to 
be mechanically harvested but grazed, must be left intact and producers 
must request, in the administrative FSA office for the acreage, a crop 
appraisal and release of crop acreage by a FCIC- or CCC-approved loss 
adjustor:
    (1) Prior to destruction or abandonment of the crop acreage; or
    (2) No later than the normal harvest date, as determined by CCC.
    (e) Producers must apply for payments prior to the earlier of the:
    (1) Date an application for coverage is filed for the crop for the 
subsequent crop year; or
    (2) Application closing date for the crop for the subsequent crop 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.11  Average market price and payment factors.

    (a) An average market price will be used to calculate assistance 
under this part and will be:
    (1) A dollar value per the applicable unit of measure of the 
eligible crop;
    (2) Determined on a harvested basis without the inclusion of 
transportation, storage, processing, marketing, or other post-harvest 
expenses, as determined by CCC;
    (3) Comparable with established FCIC prices; and
    (4) Determined, as practicable, for each intended use of a crop 
within a State for a crop year.
    (b) For these purposes, where needed, an Animal-unit-days (AUD) 
value will be based on the national average price of corn and the daily 
requirement of 13.6 megacalories of net energy for maintenance of 1 
animal unit.
    (c) Payment factors will be used to calculate assistance for crops 
produced with significant and variable harvesting expenses that are not 
incurred because the crop acreage was prevented planted or planted but 
not harvested, as determined by CCC.
    (d) An adjusted market price will be calculated based on the 
provisions in this section and others as may apply. A final payment 
price will be determined by multiplying, as appropriate, the average 
market price by the applicable payment factor (i.e. harvested, 
unharvested, or prevented planting) by 55 percent or, by multiplying the 
applicable AUD (as adjusted, if adjusted) by 55 percent.

Sec. 1437.12  Crop definition.

    (a) For the purpose of providing benefits under this part, CCC will, 
at its discretion, define crops as specified in this section.
    (b) CCC may separate or combine types and varieties as a crop when 
specific credible information as determined by CCC is provided showing 
the crop of a specific type or variety has a significantly different or 
similar value when compared to other types or varieties, as determined 
by CCC.
    (c) CCC may recognize two or more different crops planted on the 
same acreage intended for harvest during the same crop year as two or 
more separate crops. The crop acreage may include a crop intended for 
harvest before planting of a succeeding crop or a succeeding crop 
interseeded with the preceding crop prior to intended harvest of the 
preceding crop. The acreage must be in an area where the practice is 
recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by CCC, and all 
crops are recognized by CCC as able to achieve the expected yield, as 
determined by CCC.
    (d) CCC may consider crop acreage that is harvested more than once 
during the same crop year from the same plant as a single crop. The 
acreage must be in an area where the practice is recognized as a good 
farming practice, as determined by CCC.
    (e) CCC may consider each planting period of multiple planted 
acreage as a separate crop. The acreage must be in an area where the 
practice is recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by CCC.
    (f) CCC may define forage as separate crops according to the 
intended method

[[Page 531]]

of harvest, either mechanical harvest or grazed.
    (g) Forage acreage intended to be grazed may be further defined as 
warm and cool season forage crops.
    (h) Forage acreage intended to be mechanically harvested may be 
defined as a separate crop from grazed forage and may be separated based 
upon the commodity used as forage, to the extent such separation is 
allowed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (i) Crop acreage intended for the production of seed may be 
considered a separate crop from other intended uses, as determined by 
CCC, if all the following criteria apply:
    (1) The specific crop acreage is seeded, or intended to be seeded, 
with an intent of producing commercial seed as its primary intended use;
    (2) There is no possibility of other commercial uses of production 
from the same crop without regard to market conditions; and
    (3) The growing period of the specific crop acreage is uniquely 
conducive to the production of commercial seed and not conducive to the 
production of any other intended use of the crop, (e.g. vernalization in 
a biennial crop such as carrots and onions) and that accommodation 
renders the possibility of production for any other intended use of the 
crop improbable.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.13  Multiple benefits.

    (a) If a producer is eligible to receive payments under this part 
and benefits under any other program administered by the Secretary for 
the same crop loss, the producer must choose whether to receive the 
other program benefits or payments under this part, but shall not be 
eligible for both. The limitation on multiple benefits prohibits a 
producer from being compensated more than once for the same loss.
    (b) The limitation on multiple benefits in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply in any respect to Emergency Loans under subtitle 
C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961 et 
seq).
    (c) The restriction on multiple benefits does not relieve the 
producer from the requirements of making a production and acreage 
report.
    (d) If the other USDA program benefits are not available until after 
an application for benefits has been filed under this part, the producer 
may, to avoid this restriction on such other benefits, refund the total 
amount of the payment to the administrative FSA office from which the 
payment was received.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.14  Payment and income limitations.

    (a) NAP payments shall not be made in excess of $100,000 per person 
per crop year under this part.
    (b) NAP payments shall not be made to a person who has qualifying 
gross revenues in excess of $2 million for the most recent tax year 
preceding the year for which assistance is requested. Qualifying gross 
revenue means:
    (1) With respect to a person who receives more than 50 percent of 
such person's gross income from farming, ranching, and forestry 
operations, the annual gross income for the taxable year from such 
operations; and
    (2) With respect to a person who receives 50 percent or less of such 
person's gross income from farming, ranching, and forestry operations, 
the person's total gross income for the taxable year from all sources.
    (c) CCC will pay, for up to one year, simple interest on payments to 
producers which are delayed. Interest will be paid on the net amount 
ultimately found to be due, and will begin accruing on the 31st day 
after the date the producer signs, dates, and submits a properly 
completed application for payment on the designated form, or the 31st 
day after a disputed application is adjudicated. Interest will be paid 
unless the reason for failure to timely pay is due to the producer's 
failure to provide information or other material necessary for the 
computation of payment, or there was a genuine dispute concerning 
eligibility for payment.
    (d) Rules set out in 7 CFR part 1400 shall apply in implementing the 
restrictions of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.15  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) To be eligible for benefits under this part, producers must be 
in compliance with the highly erodible land and

[[Page 532]]

wetlands provisions of part 12 of this title.
    (b) The provisions of Sec. 718.11 of this title, providing for 
ineligibility for benefits for offenses involving controlled substances, 
shall apply.
    (c) A person shall be ineligible to receive assistance under this 
part for the crop year plus two subsequent crop years if it is 
determined by the State or county committee or an official of FSA that 
such person has:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the 
purpose of a program operated under this part;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation with respect to such program; 
or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (d) All amounts paid by CCC to any such producer, applicable to the 
crop year in which a violation of this part occurs, must be refunded to 
CCC together with interest and other amounts as determined appropriate 
to the circumstances by CCC.
    (e) All persons with a financial interest in the operation receiving 
benefits under this part shall be jointly and severally liable for any 
refund, including related charges, which is determined to be due CCC for 
any reason under this part.
    (f) In the event that any request for assistance or payments under 
this part was established as result of erroneous information or a 
miscalculation, the assistance or payment shall be recalculated and any 
excess refunded with applicable interest.
    (g) The liability of any person for any penalty under this part or 
for any refund to CCC or related charge arising in connection therewith 
shall be in addition to any other liability of such person under any 
civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law including, 
but not limited to: 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001 and 1014; 15 
U.S.C. 714m; and 31 U. S. C. 3729.
    (h) The appeal regulations at parts 11 and 780 of this title apply 
to decisions made according to this part.
    (i) Any payment or portion thereof to any person shall be made 
without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard 
to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof.
    (j) For the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 3201(e), the Secretary hereby 
waives the restriction on receipt of funds or benefits under this 
program but only as to beneficiaries who as a condition of such waiver 
agree to apply the benefits to reduce the amount of the judgement lien.
    (k) The provisions of parts 1400, 1403 and 1404 of this chapter 
apply to NAP.
    (l) In the case of death, incompetence or disappearance of any 
person who is eligible to receive payments under this part, such 
payments will be disbursed in accordance with part 707 of this title.


<R04>
  Subpart B--Determining Yield Coverage Using Actual Production History


<R05>
Sec. 1437.101  Actual production history.

    Actual production history will be used, except as otherwise 
indicated in this part, as the basis for providing noninsured crop 
disaster assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.102  Yield determinations.

    (a) Payments based on yields shall be made on ``approved yields'', 
which shall be calculated based on the producer's APH for that period up 
to ten years for which, of the first time such a yield is calculated, 
there are consecutive years, beginning with the most recent completed 
year, of actual production history for the producer. If there are not 
four such consecutive years of history (excluding years when the crop 
was out of rotation), then such first ``approved yield'' shall be 
constructed by creating a four year history as provided for in this 
part. After the first such approved yield is constructed, years will be 
added to that history in the manner provided for in this section, 
dropping, as needed, previous years from the history to the extent that 
the current history would be a history or base of ten years. For the 
first approved yield, as needed to construct a four-year history, 
history will be supplied using T-yields, as set out in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) The county expected yield:
    (1) Is the ``T-yield'' for the crop, and is the Olympic average 
(disregarding the high and low yields) of yields in the county the 5 
consecutive crop years

[[Page 533]]

immediately preceding the previous crop year. (Example: For the 2001 
crop year, the base period would be 1995 through 1999).
    (2) Will be the same as the FCIC transitional yield if crop 
insurance is available for the crop, (but not necessarily for the cause 
of loss if excluded by policy provisions), in the administrative county.
    (3) Will be calculated so as to be comparable to the FCIC 
transitional yield most reasonable to the area if crop insurance was 
available for the crop (but not necessarily for the cause of loss) in 
contiguous counties, but not in the immediate county.
    (c) Available historical information will be used to establish the 
county expected yields. Historical information is available from sources 
including, but is not limited to, National Agricultural Statistics 
Service data, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension 
Service records, Federal Crop Insurance Data, credible non-government 
studies, yields in similar areas, and reported actual yield data. Such 
yields will be based on the acreage intended for harvest.
    (d) County expected yields may be adjusted for:
    (1) Yield variations due to different farming practices in the 
administrative county such as: irrigated, nonirrigated, and organic 
practices; and
    (2) Cultural practices, including the age of the planting when such 
practices are different from those used on acreage to establish the 
yield.
    (e) A T-yield will be used in the actual production history database 
when less than four consecutive crop years of actual, assigned, or zero 
yields, as applicable, are available. For those producers who have land 
physically located in multiple counties and administered out of one 
county office, the T-yield for all land for the producer will be based 
on the administrative county's expected yield for that crop. Where a 
four-year base must be constructed for the producer's first approved 
yield because the producer does not have at least four consecutive years 
of actual history starting with the most recent year, then:
    (1) If an approved yield had not previously been calculated for the 
crop and there are no production records available for the most recent 
crop year, or if there is no formula provided for the producer under 
paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section, then the approved yield 
for the current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of 65 
percent of the applicable T-yield for each of the four years of the 
constructed base;
    (2) If certified acceptable production records are available for 
only the most recent crop year and there are no zero (credited) or 
assigned yields in the producer's history, the approved yield for the 
current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of the one 
actual yield plus 80 percent of the applicable T-Yield for the missing 
crop years.
    (3) If certified acceptable production records are available for 
only the two most recent crop years and there are no zero (credited) or 
assigned yields in the APH database, the approved yield for the current 
crop year will be calculated on the simple average of the two actual 
yields plus 90 percent of the applicable T-yield for the missing years.
    (4) If certified acceptable production records are available for 
only the three most recent crop years and there are no zero (credited) 
or assigned yields in the APH database, the approved yield will be 
calculated on the simple average of the three actual yields plus 100 
percent of the applicable T-Yield for the missing year.
    (f) CCC will reduce unadjusted T-yields placed in the actual 
production history database when, as determined by CCC, an unadjusted T-
yield does not accurately reflect the productive capability of specific 
crop acreage.
    (g) An actual yield includes the total amount of harvested and 
appraised production on a per acre, or other basis, as applicable.
    (h) Once an approved yield has been calculated for any year, then 
thereafter an assigned yield will be used to update or extend the 
producer's actual production history (or base) database when producers 
fail to certify a report of production after the approved yield was 
calculated and the following standards shall apply:
    (1) The assigned one-year yield will be equal to 75 percent of the 
approved

[[Page 534]]

yield calculated for the most recent crop year for which producers do 
not certify a report of production.
    (2) Producers may have only one assigned yield in the actual 
production history database.
    (3) Producers may replace an assigned yield with an actual yield by 
providing a certification of production and production records for the 
applicable crop year in accordance with Sec. 1437.7.
    (4) If the acreage of a crop in the administrative county in which 
the unit is located for the crop year increases by more than 100 percent 
over any year in the preceding seven crop years, or significantly from 
the previous crop years, as determined by CCC, producers may not receive 
an assigned yield and will receive a zero credited yield, unless 
producers provide:
    (i) Detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and 
yield for the crop year for which the producer is requesting assistance, 
or
    (ii) If CCC determines those records are inadequate, proof that the 
eligible crop, had it been harvested, could have been marketed at a 
reasonable price.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(4) of this section an assigned 
yield may be used if:
    (i) The planted acreage for the crop has been inspected by a third 
party acceptable to CCC, or
    (ii) The FSA county executive director, with the concurrence of the 
FSA state executive director, makes a recommendation for an exemption 
from the requirements and such recommendation is approved by CCC.
    (6) A zero credited yield will be used to the extent provided for in 
paragraph (i) of this section.
    (i) A zero credited yield will be placed in the actual production 
history database for each crop year, following the crop year containing 
an assigned yield, for which producers do not certify a report of 
production. A zero credited yield may be replaced with an actual yield 
by providing a certification of production and production records for 
the applicable crop year in accordance with Sec. 1437.7.
    (j) An approved yield is calculated as the simple average of a 
minimum of four, not to exceed a maximum of 10 consecutive crop year 
yields for the crops, or as determined by CCC and as provided in this 
section.
    (1) If, for one or more actual production history crop years used to 
establish the approved yield, the actual or appraised yield is less than 
65 percent of the current crop year T-yield due to losses incurred in a 
disaster year, as determined by CCC, producers may request CCC replace 
the applicable yield with a yield equal to 65 percent of the current 
crop year T-yield.
    (2) If approved yields were calculated for any of the 1995 through 
2000 crop years, and subsequently in that period production was not 
certified, producers may request CCC replace the missing yields for such 
years with yields equal to the higher of 65 percent of the current crop 
year T-yield or the missing crop years actual yield.
    (3) If producers add land in the farming operation and do not have 
available production records for the added land CCC will calculate an 
approved yield for the new unit by utilizing the actual production 
history yields for the existing unit. In the event the crop suffers a 
loss greater than 50 percent of the initial approved yield for the crop 
year and unit acreage has increased by more than 75 percent of the 
historical average acreage, CCC may adjust the approved yield, as 
determined by CCC.
    (k) If a producer is a new producer, the approved yield may be based 
on unadjusted T-Yields or a combination of actual yields and unadjusted 
T-Yields. A new producer is a person who has not been actively engaged 
in farming for a share of the production of the eligible crop in the 
administrative county for more than two APH crop years. Formation or 
dissolution of an entity which includes individuals with more than two 
APH crop years of production history during the base period does not 
qualify the new entity as a new producer for APH determination purposes.
    (l) If producers qualify as a new producer and have produced the 
crop for 1 or 2 crop years, producers must provide to CCC at the 
administrative FSA office serving the area in which the crop is located, 
a certification and records of production for those crop years.

[[Page 535]]

    (m) Further adjustments may be made as necessary to accomplish the 
purposes of this program.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.103  Determining payments for low yield.

    (a) Except to the extent that the loss calculation provisions of 
other subparts apply, and subject to limitations set out elsewhere in 
this part and in this title and to the availability of funds, payments 
under this part shall be made on eligible crops with eligible losses by:
    (1) Multiplying the total eligible acreage planted to the eligible 
crop by the producers share, and subject to provisions for specific 
crops provided elsewhere in this part;
    (2) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 
50 percent of the approved yield per acre for the commodity for the 
producer.
    (3) Subtracting net production of the total eligible acreage from 
the product of paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (4) Multiplying the difference calculated under paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section by the final payment price calculated under Sec. 1437.11, 
and then
    (5) Subtracting the value of salvage and secondary use.
    (b) Further adjustments may be made as needed to accomplish the 
purposes and goals of the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.104  Honey.

    (a) Honey production eligible for benefits under this part includes 
table and non-table honey produced commercially.
    (b) All of a producer's honey will be considered a single crop, 
regardless of type or variety of floral source or intended use.
    (c) The crop year for honey production is the calendar year, January 
1 through December 31.
    (d) In addition to filing a report of acreage in accordance with 
Sec. 1437.7, honey producers must provide a record of colonies to CCC. 
The report of colonies must be filed before the crop year for which 
producers seek to maintain coverage. The report of colonies shall 
include:
    (1) The address of the producer's headquarters and FSA farm serial 
number, if available;
    (2) Names and shares of each person sharing in the honey produced 
from the unit;
    (3) The number of all colonies of bees belonging to the unit;
    (4) The names of counties in which colonies of bees are located as 
of the date of the report; and
    (5) A certification of the number of colonies reported including all 
colonies from which production is expected.
    (e) The honey unit shall consist of all the producer's bee colonies, 
regardless of location.
    (f) Producers must designate a FSA office as the control office for 
the honey operation. Producers must complete the following actions only 
in the control office:
    (1) File an application for coverage;
    (2) File a report of colonies;
    (3) Report total unit production; and
    (4) Request to change a unit's control office.
    (g) Actions that may be taken in any Administrative FSA office 
includes:
    (1) Designating or selecting another control office; or
    (2) Filing a notice of loss in accordance with Sec. 1437.10.
    (h) Producers must notify the control office designated in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section within 30 calendar days of 
the date of:
    (1) Any changes in the total number of colonies; and
    (2) The movement of any colonies into any additional counties.
    (i) Payments will be based on the amount of losses for this 
community in excess of a 50 percent loss level at a rate determined in 
accord with this part and the authorizing legislation.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.105  Maple sap.

    (a) NAP assistance for maple sap is limited to maple sap produced on 
private property for sale as sap or syrup. Eligible maple sap must be 
produced from trees that:
    (1) Are located on land the producer controls by ownership or lease;
    (2) Are managed for production of maple sap;
    (3) Are at least 30 years old and 12 inches in diameter; and
    (4) Have a maximum of 4 taps per tree according to the tree's 
diameter.

[[Page 536]]

    (b) The crop year for maple sap production is the calendar year, 
January 1 through December 31.
    (c) If producers file an application for coverage in accordance with 
Sec. 1437.6, tree acreage containing trees from which maple sap is 
produced or is to be produced must be reported to CCC no later than the 
beginning of the crop year.
    (d) In addition to the applicable records required under 
Sec. 1437.7, producers must report the:
    (1) Total number of eligible trees on the unit;
    (2) Average size and age of producing trees; and
    (3) Total number of taps placed or anticipated for the tapping 
season.
    (e) A maximum county-expected-yield for maple sap shall be 10 
gallons of sap per tap per crop year unless acceptable documentary 
evidence, as determined by CCC, is available to CCC to support a higher 
county-expected-yield.
    (f) The average market price for maple sap must be established for 
the value of the sap before processing into syrup. If price data is 
available only for maple syrup, this data must be converted to a maple 
sap basis. The wholesale price for a gallon of maple syrup shall be 
multiplied by 0.00936 to arrive at the average market price of a gallon 
of maple sap.
    (g) The actual production history for maple sap shall be recorded on 
the basis of gallons of sap per tap.
    (h) The unit's expected production is determined by:
    (1) Multiplying the number of taps placed in eligible trees; by
    (2) The approved per tap yield as determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1437.102.
    (i) Payments will be based on the amount of losses for this 
community in excess of a 50 percent loss level at a rate determined in 
accord with this part and the authorizing legislation.

      Subpart C--Determining Coverage for Prevented Planted Acreage


<R05>
Sec. 1437.201  Prevented planting acreage.

    (a) Prevented planting is the inability to plant an eligible crop 
with proper equipment during the planting period as a result of an 
eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC.
    (b) The eligible cause of loss that prevented planting must have:
    (1) Occurred after a previous planting period for the crop and
    (2) Before the final planting date for the crop in the applicable 
crop year or in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the 
first planting in the applicable planting period, and
    (3) Generally affected other producers in the area, as determined by 
CCC.
    (c) Producers must be prevented from planting more than 35 percent 
of the total eligible acreage intended for planting to the eligible crop 
and in the case of multiple planting, more than 35 percent of the total 
eligible acres intended to be planted within the applicable planting 
period.
    (d) Eligible prevented planting acreage will be determined on the 
basis of the producer's intent to plant the crop acreage, and possession 
of, or access to, resources to plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as 
applicable.
    (e) Acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage includes, but 
is not limited to:
    (1) Acreage which planting history or conservation plans indicate 
would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes; and
    (2) Acreage used for conservation purposes or intended to be or 
considered to have been left unplanted under any program administered by 
USDA, including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs.

<R05>
Sec. 1437.202  Determining payments for prevented planting.

    (a) Subject to limitations, availability of funds, and specific 
provisions dealing with specific crops, a payment for prevented planting 
will be determined by:
    (1) Multiplying the producer's total eligible acreage intended for 
planting to the eligible crop by the producer's share;
    (2) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 
65 percent;
    (3) Subtracting the total acres planted from the product of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (4) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(3) of this section by 
50 percent of the producer's approved yield;
    (5) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(4) of this section by 
the final payment price for the producer's crop as calculated by the 
agency under Sec. 1437.11.
    (b) Yields for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
calculated in the same manner as for low-yield claims.

<R04>
               Subpart D--Determining Coverage Using Value


<R05>
Sec. 1437.301  Value loss.

    (a) Special provisions are required to assess losses and calculate 
assistance for a few crops and commodities which do not lend themselves 
to yield loss situations. Assistance for these commodities is calculated 
based on the loss of value at the time of disaster. The agency shall 
determine which crops shall be treated as value-loss crops, but unless 
otherwise announced, such crops shall be limited to those identified in 
Secs. 1437.303 through 1437.309 as value loss crops. Lost productions of 
value loss crops shall be compensable only under this subpart.
    (b) The crop year for all value loss crops is October 1 through 
September 30.
    (c) Producers must file an application for coverage in accordance 
with Sec. 1437.6, and must:
    (1) Provide a report of the crop, commodity, and facility to CCC for 
the acreage or facility, in a form prescribed by CCC, no later than the 
beginning of the crop year.
    (2) Maintain a verifiable inventory of the eligible crop throughout 
the crop year; and
    (3) Provide an accurate accounting of the inventory, as required by 
CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.302  Determining payments.

    Subject to all restrictions and the availability of funds, value 
loss payments for qualifying losses will be determined by:
    (a) Multiplying the field market value of the crop before the 
disaster by 50 percent;
    (b) Subtracting the sum of the field market value after the disaster 
and value of ineligible causes of loss from the result from paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section;
    (c) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(2) of this section by 
the producer's share;
    (d) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(3) of this section by 
55 percent plus whatever factor deemed appropriate to reflect savings 
from non-harvesting of the damaged crop or other factors as appropriate;
    (e) Multiplying the salvage value by the producer's share;
    (f) Subtracting the result from paragraph (a)(5) of this section 
from the result from paragraph (a)(4) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.303  Aquaculture, including ornamental fish.

    (a) Aquaculture is a value loss crop and is compensable only in 
accord with restrictions set in this section. Eligible aquacultural 
species shall only include:
    (1) Any species of aquatic organisms grown as food for human 
consumption as determined by CCC.

     Subpart E--Determining Coverage of Forage Intended for Animal 
                               Consumption


<R05>
Sec. 1437.401  Forage.

    (a) Forage eligible to generate benefits under this part is limited 
to vegetation produced for animal consumption in a commercial operation 
using acceptable farming, pasture and range management practices for the 
location necessary to sustain sufficient quality and quantity of the 
vegetation so as to be suitable for grazing livestock or mechanical 
harvest. Forage to be mechanically harvested shall be treated under the 
rules for low-yield crops as calculated under Sec. 1437.103. Claims on 
forage for grazing benefits will, contrariwise, be determined under this 
subpart. However, the provisions in this subpart shall govern for all 
claims including forage for mechanical harvest.
    (b) Producers of forage must, in addition to the records required in 
Sec. 1437.7, specify the intended method of harvest of all acreage 
intended as forage for livestock consumption as either mechanically or 
grazed.
    (c) Producers must, in the administrative FSA office for the unit, 
request an appraisal prior to the onset of grazing of any intended 
mechanically harvested forage acreage that will be both mechanically 
harvested and grazed.
    (d) Forage acreage reported to FSA as intended to be mechanically 
harvested which is subsequently completely grazed will be considered for 
crop definition purposes as mechanically harvested. Expected production 
of the specific acreage will be calculated on the basis of carrying 
capacity.
    (e) Small grain forage is the specific acreage of wheat, barley, 
oats, triticale, or rye intended for use as forage. Small grain forage 
shall be considered separate crops and distinct from any other forage 
commodities and other intended uses of the small grain commodity. In 
addition to the records required in Sec. 1437.7 producers must specify 
whether the intended forage crop is intended for fall/winter, spring, or 
total season forage. In addition to other eligibility requirements, CCC 
will consider other factors, such as, water sources and available 
fencing, and adequate fertilization to determine small grain forage 
eligibility, yields, and production.
    (f) CCC will establish forage losses of acreage intended to be 
grazed on the basis of:
    (1) For improved pasture, as determined by CCC, a similar percentage 
of loss of mechanically harvested forage acreage on the farm, or similar 
farms in the area; or
    (2) For native pasture, as determined by CCC, the percentage of loss 
as determined by two independent assessments of pasture conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.402  Carrying capacity.

    (a) CCC will establish a carrying capacity for all grazed forage 
present in the county for purposes of administering this program and to 
that end:
    (1) Multiple carrying capacities may be determined for a specific 
vegetation if factors, such as soil type, elevation, and topography, 
result in a significant difference of carrying capacity within the 
county.
    (2) CCC may establish separate carrying capacities for irrigated and 
non-irrigated forage acreage when acreage of traditionally irrigated 
forage (forage actually irrigated 3 of the last 5 crop years) is present 
in the county.
    (b) Producers may provide evidence that unit forage management and 
maintenance practices are improvements over those practices generally 
associated with the established carrying capacity. Based on this 
evidence, CCC may adjust the expected AUD for the specific forage 
acreage upward for the crop year NAP assistance is requested by:

[[Page 542]]

    (1) Three percent when at least 1 practice was completed at least 1 
time in the previous 5 crop years and such practice can be expected to 
have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop 
year NAP assistance is requested;
    (2) Five percent when 2 or more practices were completed at least 1 
time in the previous 5 crop years and such practices can be expected to 
have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop 
year NAP assistance is requested; and
    (3) Greater than 5 percent when producers provide acceptable 
records, as determined by CCC, of higher forage production or an 
increase in animal units supported on the specific forage acreage in 3 
of the 5 crop years immediately before the crop year NAP assistance is 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.403  Determining payments.

    Subject to payment limits, availability of funds, and other limits 
as may apply, payments for losses of forage reported to FSA as intended 
to be grazed will be determined by:
    (a) Multiplying the eligible acreage by the producer's share;
    (b) Dividing the result from paragraph (a) of this section by the 
carrying capacity or adjusted per day carrying capacity established for 
the specific acreage, as determined by CCC;
    (c) Multiplying the result from paragraph (b) of this section by the 
number of days established as the grazing period;
    (d) Adding adjustments of AUD for practices and production to the 
product of paragraph (c) of this section;
    (e) Multiplying the result from paragraph (d) of this section by the 
applicable percentage of loss established by CCC;
    (f) Multiplying the amount of AUD lost to other causes, as 
determined by CCC, by the producer's share;
    (g) Subtracting the result from paragraph (f) of this section from 
the result from paragraph (e) of this section;
    (h) Multiplying the result from paragraph (d) of this section by 
0.50;
    (i) Subtracting the result from paragraph (h) of this section from 
the result from paragraph (g) of this section; and
    (j) Multiplying the result from paragraph (i) of this section by the 
AUD value established in accordance with Sec. 1437.11, and then by 55 
percent.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.404  Information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act; OMB control number.

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control number for the 
regulation in this part is 0560-0175.

              Subpart B--2000 Livestock Assistance Program

    Source: 66 FR 15542, Mar. 19, 2001, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.101  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to 
the 2000 Livestock Assistance Program (LAP-2000) authorized by Public 
Law 106-387, 114 Stat. 1549. Program regulations for prior livestock 
assistance programs can be found at 7 CFR 1439 as it was published on 
January 1, 2001. Benefits will be provided to eligible livestock 
producers in the United States for LAP-2000 but only in counties where a 
natural disaster declaration was issued after January 1, 2000 by the 
President of the United States or the Secretary of Agriculture of the 
United States and that were subsequently approved for relief under this 
part by the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs.
    (b) During the 2000 calendar year for LAP-2000, a producer must be 
in a county where a natural disaster declaration was approved after 
January 1, 2000, and also approved and determined by the Deputy 
Administrator for Farm Programs (or a designee) as having suffered 
losses during calendar year 2000. Contiguous counties that were not 
designated as a disaster area in their own right will not be eligible 
for participation in the LAP-2000 under this part.

[[Page 547]]

Grazing losses must have occurred on native and improved pasture with 
permanent vegetative cover and other crops planted specifically for the 
sole purpose of providing grazing for livestock, but such losses do not 
include losses on, or with respect to, seeded small grain forage crops.
    (c) To be eligible for assistance under this subpart, a livestock 
producer's pastures must have suffered at least a 40-percent loss of 
normal carrying capacity for a minimum of 3 consecutive months during 
the relevant calendar year. The percent of loss eligible for 
compensation shall not exceed the maximum percentage of grazing loss for 
the county as determined by the county committee. In addition, the 
producer will not be compensated for that part of any loss that would 
represent payment of a loss greater than 80 percent.
    (d) Except as approved by the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs 
(or designee), a livestock producer is not eligible to receive payments 
for the same loss under this subpart if that loss has been recovered 
under another Federal program of some other source.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.102  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section shall be applicable for 
all purposes of administering this subpart. The definitions in 
Sec. 1439.3 shall also be applicable, except where those definitions 
conflict with the definitions set forth in this subpart, in which case 
the definitions in this section will apply. The definitions follow:
    Application means the Form CCC-740, Livestock Assistance Program 
Application. The CCC-740 is available at county FSA offices.
    Livestock means beef and dairy cattle, buffalo and beefalo (when 
maintained on the same basis as beef cattle), sheep, goats, swine, and 
equine animals where such equine animals are used commercially for human 
food or kept for the production of food or fiber on the owner's farm.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.103  Application process.

    (a) Livestock producers must submit a completed application prior to 
the close of business on March 23, 2000, or such other date as 
established and announced by the Deputy Administrator. The application 
and any other supporting documentation shall be submitted to the county 
FSA office with administrative authority over a producer's eligible 
grazing land or to the county FSA office that maintains the farm records 
for the livestock producer.
    (b) Livestock producers shall certify as to the accuracy of all the 
information contained in the application, and provide any other 
information to CCC that the county FSA office or committee deems 
necessary to determine the livestock producer's eligibility.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.104  County committee determinations of general applicability.

    (a) County committees shall determine whether due to natural 
disasters their county has suffered a 40-percent loss affecting pasture 
and normal grazing crops for at least 3 consecutive months during 
calendar year 2000 for LAP-2000. In making this determination, county 
committees, using the best information available from sources including 
but not limited to: the Extension Service, the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service; the Palmer Drought Index; and general knowledge of 
local rainfall data, pasture losses, grazing livestock movement out of 
county, abnormal supplemental feeding practices for livestock on pasture 
and liquidation of grazing livestock, shall determine the percentage of 
grazing losses for pastures on a county-wide basis. The county committee 
shall submit rainfall data, percentage of grazing losses for each 
general type of pasture, and the weighted average percentage of grazing 
loss for the county, with State committee concurrence, to the Deputy 
Administrator on form CCC-654. The maximum grazing losses the county 
committees shall submit on form CCC-654 is 80 percent. These 
determinations shall be subject to review and approval of the Deputy 
Administrator. For purposes of this subpart, such counties are called 
``eligible counties.''
    (b) In each county, the county committee shall determine a LAP crop 
year. The LAP crop year shall be that period of time in a calendar year 
that begins with the date grazing of new

[[Page 548]]

growth pasture normally begins and ends on the date grazing without 
supplemental feeding normally ends in the county.
    (c) In and for each eligible county, the county committee shall 
determine normal carrying capacities for each type of grazing or pasture 
during the LAP crop year. The normal carrying capacity for the LAP crop 
year shall be the normal carrying capacity the county committee 
determines could be expected from pasture and normal grazing crops for 
livestock for the LAP crop year if a natural disaster had not diminished 
the production of these grazing crops.
    (d) In each eligible county, the county committee shall determine 
the payment period for the county. The payment period for the county 
shall be the period of time during the county's LAP crop year where for 
3 consecutive months during 2000, the carrying capacity for grazing land 
or pasture was reduced by 40 percent or more from the normal carrying 
capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.105  Loss criteria.

    (a) Grazing land for which a livestock producer requests benefits 
must be within the physical boundary of the county for which a 
Presidential disaster declaration or Secretarial disaster declaration 
was granted for disasters occurring during calendar year 2000. Livestock 
producers in unapproved counties contiguous to an eligible county will 
not receive benefits under this subpart.
    (b) To be eligible for benefits under this subpart, a livestock 
producer in an eligible county must have suffered a loss of grazing 
production equivalent to at least a 40-percent loss of normal carrying 
capacity for a minimum of 3 consecutive months.
    (c) A producer shall certify each type of pasture and percentage of 
loss suffered by each type on the application. In establishing the 
percentage of grazing loss, producers shall consider the amount of 
available grazing production during the LAP crop year, whether more than 
the normal acreage of grazing land was required to support livestock 
during the LAP crop year, and whether supplemental feeding of livestock 
began earlier or later than normal.
    (d) The county committee shall determine the producer's grazing loss 
and shall consider the amount of available grazing production during the 
LAP crop year, whether more than the normal acreage of grazing land was 
required to support livestock during the LAP crop year, and whether 
supplemental feeding of livestock began earlier or later than normal. 
The county committee shall request the producer to provide proof of loss 
of grazing production if the county committee determines the producer's 
certified loss exceeds other similarly situated livestock producers.
    (e) The percentage of loss claimed by a livestock producer shall not 
exceed the maximum allowable percentage of grazing loss for the county 
as determined by the county committee in accordance with 
Sec. 1439.104(a). Livestock producers will not receive benefits under 
this subpart for any portion of their loss that exceeds 80 percent of 
normal carrying capacity.
    (f) Conservation Reserve Program acres released for haying and/or 
grazing and seeded small grain forage crops shall not be used to 
calculate losses under this subpart.


<R05>

livestock may be considered as livestock producers eligible to apply for 
benefits under this subpart.
    (c) An owner of livestock who uses another person to provide pasture 
or grazing land on a rate-of-gain basis is not considered to be the 
livestock producer eligible to apply for benefits under this subpart.
    (d) An owner who pledges livestock as security for a loan shall be 
considered as the person eligible to apply for benefits under this 
subpart if all other requirements of this part are met. Livestock leased 
under a contractual

[[Page 549]]

agreement that has been in effect at least 3 months and establishes an 
interest for the lessee in such livestock shall be considered as being 
owned by the lessee.
    (e) Livestock must have been owned for at least 3 months before 
becoming eligible for payment.

Sec. 1439.107  Calculation of assistance.

    (a) The value of LAP assistance determined with respect to a 
livestock producer for each type and weight class of livestock owned or 
leased by such producer shall be the lesser of the amount calculated 
under paragraph (b) of this section (the total value of lost feed needs 
for eligible livestock) or calculated under paragraph (c) of this 
section (the total value of lost eligible pasture).
    (b) The total value of lost feed needs shall be the amount obtained 
by multiplying:
    (1) The number of days in the payment period the livestock are owned 
or, in the case of purchased livestock, meet the 3-month ownership 
requirement; by
    (2) The number of pounds of corn-equivalent per day, as established 
by CCC, that is determined necessary to provide the energy requirements

    (c) The total value of lost eligible pasture shall be the amounts 
for each type of pasture calculated by:
    (1) Dividing the number of acres of each pasture type by the 
carrying capacity established for the pasture; and multiplying the 
result by
    (2) The 5-year national average market price for corn ($2.36 bushel 
or $0.0421428 per pound); by
    (3) The daily feed grain equivalent per animal (15.7 pounds of corn 
necessary for a beef cow, factored for the weight class and type of 
livestock, as determined by CCC); by
    (4) The applicable number of days in the LAP payment period; by
    (5) The percent of the producer's grazing loss during the relevant 
period as certified by the producer and approved by the county committee 
in accordance with Sec. 1439.105.
    (d) The final payment shall be the smaller of paragraph (b) of this 
section or paragraph (c) of this section multiplied by the national 
factor if required under Sec. 1439.108. The final payment shall not 
exceed 50 percent of the smaller of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section 
determined prior to applying the national factor provided for in 
Sec. 1439.108.
    (e) Seeded small grain forage crops shall not be counted as grazing 
land under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to supporting 
eligible livestock.

under this subpart and in paragraph (a) of this section are limited to 
the number actually needed to produce food and fiber on the producer's 
farm or to breed horses and mules to be used to produce food and fiber 
on the owner's farm, and shall not include animals that are used for 
recreational purposes or are running wild or uncontrolled on land owned 
or leased by the owner.

Sec. 1439.205  Proof of loss.

    (a) In the case of fires or natural disasters, livestock owners 
must, in accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy 
Administrator, provide adequate proof that the death of the eligible 
livestock occurred during the recognized natural disaster period, as 
provided in Sec. 1439.201(b); or was reasonably related to the disaster.
    (b) The livestock owner shall provide any available supporting

certifies in writing that there is no other documentation available. 
Third-party verification must be signed by the party that is verifying 
the information. Failure to provide documentation that is satisfactory 
to the county committee will result in the disapproval of the 
application by the county committee.
    (e) Livestock owners shall certify the accuracy of the information 
provided. All information provided is subject to verification and spot 
checks by the CCC. A failure to provide information requested by the 
county committee or by agency officials is cause for denial of any 
application filed under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.206  Indemnity benefits.

    (a) Livestock indemnity payments for losses of eligible livestock as 
determined by CCC are authorized to be made to livestock owners, based 
on the owner's share of the livestock, who file an application for the 
specific livestock category in accordance with instructions issued by 
the Deputy Administrator, if:
    (1) The livestock owner submits an approved proof of loss in 
accordance with Sec. 1439.205; and
    (2) The FSA county or State committee determines that because of an 
eligible disaster condition the livestock owner had a loss in the 
specific livestock category in excess of the normal mortality rate 
established by CCC, based on the number of animals in the livestock 
category that were in the owner's inventory at the time of the disaster.
    (b) If the number of losses in the animal category exceeds the 
normal mortality rate established by CCC for such category, the loss of 
livestock that shall be used in making a payment shall be the number of 
animal losses in

[[Page 552]]

       Subpart E--Livestock Indemnity Program for Contract Growers


<R05>
Sec. 1439.401  Applicability.

    This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions of the Livestock 
Indemnity Program for Contract Growers. Under Title I of the Omnibus 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000 (Pub. L. 106-113; 113 Stat. 1501), 
the Secretary is specifically authorized to use $10 million to provide 
assistance to persons who raise livestock owned by other persons for 
income losses sustained with respect to livestock during 1999 if the 
Secretary finds that such losses are the result of natural disasters. 
Section 802 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (Pub. L. 
106-387; 114 Stat. 1549) amended the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2000, to cover losses that occurred during the period January 1, 
2000 through February 7, 2000. Accordingly, this subpart provides for 
benefits to be paid to eligible producers who sustained a loss of income 
directly attributed to a reduction in the production of livestock and 
livestock products from livestock that were entirely owned by others, 
due to or as a result of natural disasters that occurred from January 1 
through February 7, 2000 in areas for which a Presidential or 
Secretarial Declaration was approved. Producers in contiguous counties 
that were not designated as a disaster area in their own right are not 
eligible for benefits under this part. Benefits will be provided with 
respect to eligible livestock where the death occurred in the disaster 
area during January 1 through February 7, 2000 where the death was 
reasonably related to the disaster that prompted the disaster 
declaration as determined by the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, 
or designee. The livestock had to be in possession of the applicant 
during the time in which the disaster occurred.

reduction of income, occurred in the area of a Presidential designation 
or Secretarial declaration referred to in Sec. 1439.401 and that the 
death of the eligible livestock was reasonably related to the recognized 
natural disaster. The documentary evidence of loss, quantity of the 
loss, and type of eligible livestock claimed for payment, shall be 
reported to CCC together with any supporting documentation under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The livestock producer shall provide any available supporting 
documents that will assist the county committee in verifying the loss 
and the quantity of eligible livestock that perished in the natural 
disaster. Examples of supporting documentation include, but are not 
limited to: written contracts, production records, veterinarian 
receipts, bank loan papers, rendering truck receipts, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and National Guard records, and any other documents 
available to confirm the presence of the livestock and the subsequent 
losses. Certification of third parties or the producer and other such 
documentation as the county committee determines to be necessary for the 
verification of the information provided by the applicant may be 
submitted, subject to review and approval of the county committee. 
Failure to provide documentation that is satisfactory to the county 
committee can result in disapproval of the application by the county 
committee.
    (c) In all circumstances, livestock producers shall certify to the 
accuracy of the information provided. As provided by various statutes, 
providing a false certification to the government is

[[Page 560]]

punishable by imprisonment, fines and other penalties. All such 
remedies, as well as all civil remedies, may be applied. All information 
provided is subject to verification and spot check by the CCC.

Sec. 1439.406  Indemnity benefits.

    (a) Payment under this part shall only be made to livestock 
producers who file a Certification of Livestock Losses for Eligible 
Disaster--Contract Growers, Form CCC-661B, for the specific livestock 
category for which relief is sought and file such form in accordance 
with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator. In addition, 
payment may be made only if:
    (1) The livestock producer submits a proof of loss that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 1439.405; and
    (2) The county or State committee determines that because of an 
eligible disaster condition the livestock producer had a loss in the 
specific category in excess of the normal mortality rate established by 
CCC, based on the number of animals in the livestock category that were 
in the livestock producer's inventory at the time of the disaster event.
    (b) If the number of losses in the animal category exceeds the 
normal mortality rate established by CCC for such category, the loss of 
eligible livestock that shall be used in making a payment shall be the 
number of animal losses in the category that exceed the normal mortality 
threshold established by CCC.
    (c) Subject to the availability of funds, payments shall be made in 
an amount determined by multiplying: the national payment rate for the 
livestock category as determined by CCC by the amount specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.407  Proration of claims.

    In the event that the funds made available to satisfy claims shall 
be less than the demand for such funds, the Deputy Administrator may 
reduce all claims by a uniform percentage to account for the level of 
available funds, or may take such other measures as he deems appropriate 
to apportion the funds among the claimants. Such payment reductions as 
are made shall be applied after the imposition of applicable payment 
limitation provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.408  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Payments under this subpart are subject to provisions contained 
in subpart A of this part including, but not limited to provisions 
concerning misrepresentations, payment limitations, limitations on 
eligibility tied to the person's gross income, and refunds to CCC, 
liens, assignment of payments, and appeals, and maintenance of books and 
records. In addition other parts of this chapter and of chapter VII of 
this title relating to payments in event of death, the handling of 
claims, and other matters may apply, as may other provisions of law and 
regulation.
    (b) Any payments not earned that have been paid must be returned 
with interest subject to such other remedies as may be allowed by law.
    (c) No interest will be paid or accrue on benefits under this 
subpart that are delayed or otherwise not timely issued unless otherwise 
mandated by law.
    (d) Nothing in this subpart shall require a commitment of funds to 
this subpart in excess of that determined to be appropriate by the 
Deputy Administrator and/or CCC.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator can deny or adjust claims in those 
instances in which the party seeking relief was affiliated with or 
related to the owner of the livestock if it is determined by the Deputy 
Administrator that such action is consistent with the purposes of this 
subpart and may take such action as is deemed appropriate to avoid 
overlap with relief available under other subparts in this part.
    (f) In no instance, unless otherwise approved by the Deputy 
Administrator, will the amount to be expended under this program exceed 
$10 million.

benefits under this subpart.
    (b) To be eligible for benefits under this subpart, a producer in an 
eligible county must have land in a county which is eligible for 
payment. Such land, to be eligible for payment must meet all of the 
following criteria:
    (1) The land is cropland or pasture land used for the production of 
feed for livestock (haying, grazing, or feed grain production) or other 
agricultural use in one or more years during the period beginning 
October 1, 1991, through September 30, 1999;
    (2) The land is inaccessible or unable to be used for crop 
production, grazing, or haying because of flooding or excess moisture 
during all of the period beginning October 1, 1999, through September 
30, 2000 unless some other period is established as the 2000-crop year 
for the commodity by the Deputy Administrator;
    (3) The land was not used for planting during October 1, 1999, 
through September 30, 2000;
    (4) The land has been owned, leased or under a binding cash lease by 
the producer continuously since October 1, 1999;
    (5) The land is a contiguous parcel of land with an area equal to 
one acre or more;
    (6) The land was not, except as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, the subject of, nor will be the subject of, any other 
federal payment for activities or lack of activity during the period 
October 1, 1999, through September 30, 2000, whether or not disaster-
related, with the exception of the production flexibility contract (PFC) 
program payments received under 7 CFR part 1412. This prohibition 
includes but is not limited to other payments under this part, or 
payments under the Conservation Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1410), the 
Wetlands Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1467), any Emergency Watershed 
Protection Program, or Federal Easement Program.
    (c) On Form CCC-454 producers shall be required to certify by tract 
on each farm the number of flooded cropland and non-cropland acres for 
the farm in 2000 and the number of flooded cropland and non-cropland 
acres in 1992. To establish the acreage eligible for payment, flooded 
land certified for 1992 for each type shall be subtracted from the 
flooded land certified for 2000 for the applicable type. The difference 
will be the acreages of cropland and non-cropland subject to flooding 
and eligible for FCP payment, except that the difference may be adjusted 
as needed to ensure, to the extent practicable, an accurate estimate of 
the net increased flooding on the farm after October 1, 1993.
    (d) All determinations as to the amount of land eligible for 
enrollment and compensation under this subpart are subject to approval 
by the county committee.
    (e) The FSA county committee may use any available documentation to

<R05>
Sec. 1439.508  Calculation of assistance.

    (a) The unadjusted value of FCP assistance determined with respect 
to the flooded land in an eligible county for each producer shall not 
exceed the amount obtained by adding the amounts in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section.
    (b) For each eligible producer with respect to the applicable 
qualifying cropland which is determined, consistent with this subpart, 
to be eligible land for the payment purposes, the established local 
payment rate for cropland will be multiplied by the number of acres 
determined to be qualifying acres, as determined by the County Committee 
in accordance with instructions of the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) For each eligible producer with respect to the applicable 
qualifying non-cropland acres consistent with this subpart, as 
determined by the county committee in accordance with instructions of 
the Deputy Administrator, the acres will be multiplied by the 
established payment rate for non-cropland acres.
    (d) Payments will be adjusted as determined necessary to comply with 
other provisions of this subpart such as those set in Sec. 1439.509.


<R05>

    In the event that the total amount of claims submitted under this 
subpart exceeds the $24 million authorized for FCP by Public Law 106-
224, each payment to a producer shall be reduced by a uniform national 
percentage. Such payment reductions shall be after the imposition of 
applicable payment limitation provisions.

<R05>
Sec. 1439.901  Applicability.

    This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions of a government-to-
government program titled the American Indian Livestock Feed Program 
(AILFP). Assistance will be available in those regions that CCC 
determines have been affected by natural disaster, and where a 
determination is made by the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs that 
a livestock feed emergency exists on tribal land. Funds made available 
to CCC shall be available for any outstanding crop year 2000 payment 
applications and in subsequent crop years contract requests until 
funding is exhausted. Payments may become available as contracts with 
tribal governments are approved. If any other benefits are received from 
the Department of Agriculture for the same loss, then payments under 
this part will be reduced accordingly. Payments will terminate when 
funds have been exhausted, without respect to the date of any 
application, or of when any contract has been entered into by any tribal 
government and CCC. Applicants will receive benefits on a first-come, 
first-served basis.

contract are not met, payments and benefits previously provided by CCC 
that were not earned under the provisions of the application shall be 
refunded.

the application, and each owner shall receive benefits or final payment 
from CCC according to benefits or payments earned under the provisions 
of the application.

program if CCC has made assistance available to such applicant under any 
other CCC program with respect to the same natural disaster.
    (e) The amount of assistance provided to any owner shall not exceed

additional, a person must be approved as a handler and must contract 
with the marketing association on form CCC-1028 or form CCC-1028-A to

    (a) Indebtedness to the United States due to peanut marketing 
penalties. As provided in part 729 of this title, if a producer is 
indebted to the United States for a peanut marketing penalty, such 
penalty shall result in a lien in favor of the United States on any 
peanuts in which such producer has an interest and any person who 
acquires peanuts from such producer shall be considered to have notice 
of such lien at the time such lien becomes attached. Except with respect 
to any lien that was perfected before the peanut poundage quota lien 
became attached in those cases not involving peanuts placed in the price 
support loan inventory, any person who acquires peanuts from such 
producer shall deduct the lien amount plus any applicable interest from 
the proceeds otherwise due to such producer as a result of the 
acquisition of the peanuts. Any deducted amount shall be paid to CCC in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator. In the

the amount of the lien, to the extent of the market value of such 
peanuts or proceeds of the peanuts whichever is higher.
    (b) Farmers Home Administration or Farm Service Agency lien. If a 
Farmers Home Administration or Farm Service Agency lien has been 
recorded on the marketing card that was issued for the use of a producer 
when marketing peanuts, the purchaser of such peanuts shall make the

producer and the Farm Service Agency. However, if a peanut poundage 
quota lien was also recorded on the marketing card against such 
producer, the check shall be made payable jointly to the producer, CCC

Sec. 1446.305  Additional peanuts ineligible for price support.

    (a) Marketing penalty. A marketing penalty is due if additional 
peanuts are marketed or considered marketed in any manner other than:
    (1) Through a price support loan at the additional loan rate; or
    (2) Through purchase for crushing or export by a handler who, in 
accordance with this part, has an approved contract with the producer to 
purchase peanuts for such purpose.
    (b) Delivery to avoid penalty. Notwithstanding the provisions in 
paragraph (a) of this section, a person who has produced additional 
peanuts may avoid a marketing penalty on such peanuts through forfeiting 
such peanuts by delivering such peanuts to the marketing association for 
the area where the peanuts were produced and in accordance with 
instructions issued by the marketing association if:
    (1) Such person is not an eligible producer; and

[[Page 581]]

    (2) Such person does not have a contract with a handler to purchase 
such peanuts for crushing or exportation.
    (c) Interest due. A producer who pledges peanuts as collateral for a 
price support loan at the additional loan rate shall refund the loan 
advance on such peanuts with interest if, subsequent to the time the 
peanuts are pledged for the loan, it is brought to the attention of the 
marketing association that such person is not an eligible producer. 
Interest shall be due:
    (1) At the same interest rate that was applicable on funds borrowed 
from CCC by the marketing association on the date the loan was 
disbursed.
    (2) From the date the loan was disbursed to the date of repayment.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.306  Commingling of peanuts.

    To facilitate handling and marketing, unless prohibited by a 
handler's storage contract with the marketing association, a handler may 
store farmers stock loan peanuts on a commingled basis with peanuts 
owned by such handler if such peanuts are of like crop, type, area, and 
segregation.
    (a) Accounting for commingled peanuts. Except for peanuts purchased 
from CCC for domestic edible use on an in-grade and in-weight basis, 
commingled peanuts shall be exchanged on a dollar value basis. 
Accordingly, when loan peanuts are removed from the warehouse they must 
be inspected as farmers stock peanuts by an inspector and accounted for 
on a dollar value, based on the quota loan rate, less a one-time 
adjustment for shrinkage for each crop.
    (b) Dollar value shrinkage adjustment. For peanuts that are graded 
out and accounted for:
    (1) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (i) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (ii) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.
    (2) After January 31 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (i) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (ii) 3.5 percent for all other peanuts.
    (c) Maintaining copies of the FSA-1007's. The handler shall maintain 
a copy of each form FSA-1007 that was issued for any peanuts that are 
placed in commingled storage and that is issued for any peanuts removed 
from storage.
    (d) Good commercial practice. The handler shall receive, store and 
deliver all such peanuts in accordance with good commercial practice and 
any instructions provided by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.307  Disaster transfer of Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 peanuts from additional loan to quota loan.

    (a) Transfer of Segregation 2 and Segregation 3 peanuts. Except as 
otherwise provided in this section, after a producer has completed 
marketing all peanuts produced on the farm, such producer may transfer a 
loan on Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 additional peanuts to a quota 
loan.
    (b) Limitation of amount eligible for transfer. A transfer made in 
accordance with this section shall not exceed the smaller of:
    (1) The difference between:
    (i) The total quantity of Segregation 1 peanuts marketed from the 
farm, plus the amount of peanuts retained on the farm for seed or other 
use, and
    (ii) The effective farm poundage quota, excluding quota pounds 
transferred to the farm in the fall; or
    (2) Twenty-five percent of the effective farm poundage quota, 
excluding quota pounds transferred to the farm in the fall.
    (c) Offset of CCC losses. As provided in this part, if a producer 
transfers an additional loan to a quota loan in accordance with the 
provisions of this section, any pool proceeds otherwise due such 
producer from peanuts in another pool shall be reduced by the amount of 
any losses to CCC on the peanuts so transferred.
    (d) Loan value for transferred peanuts--(1) Segregation 2 peanuts. 
The quota loan value for any lot of Segregation 2 peanuts transferred 
from an additional loan to a quota loan shall be determined by 
multiplying 70 percent of the quota loan rate that otherwise would have 
been applicable for such lot of peanuts as quota peanuts, exclusive of 
any discount for damaged kernels, by the net weight of peanuts being 
transferred and deducting from the result the amount of any special 
discount

[[Page 582]]

that may apply for Segregation 2 peanuts transferred in accordance with 
this section.
    (2) Segregation 3 peanuts. The quota loan value for any lot of 
Segregation 3 peanuts transferred from an additional loan to a quota 
loan shall be determined by multiplying 70 percent of the quota loan 
rate that otherwise would have been applicable for such lot of peanuts 
as quota peanuts, exclusive of any discount for damaged kernels, by the 
net weight of peanuts being transferred and deducting from the result 
the amount of any special discount that may apply for Segregation 3 
peanuts transferred in accordance with this section.
    (e) Transfer provisions--(1) Where to apply. Producers who are 
eligible to transfer additional loan peanuts to the quota loan pool in 
accordance with the provisions of this section may apply for such 
transfers with the county FSA office.
    (2) Determination of the amount eligible for transfer. The county 
office shall determine, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, the quantity of additional peanuts which are eligible for 
transfer.
    (3) Designation of peanuts to be transferred. The producer must 
indicate to the county office the net weight and applicable form FSA-
1007 serial numbers for the peanuts to be transferred.
    (4) Applicability of marketings. Any peanuts that are transferred 
from an additional loan to a quota loan shall be considered as 
marketings of quota peanuts and the applicable records shall be 
appropriately adjusted.
    (f) Supplemental loan payment. The difference between the additional 
and quota loan rates for such peanuts, less the appropriate adjustment 
for the marketing assessment, shall be advanced by the marketing 
association to the applicable producer.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.308  Loan pools.

    (a) Establishment of pools. (1) Each marketing association shall 
establish six separate loan pools; one for each of the three 
segregations of additional peanuts and one for each of the three 
segregations for quota peanuts. These pools shall be formed without 
regard to the type of peanuts (Runner, Virginia, Spanish, or Valencia) 
involved. However, the SWPGA shall also establish 12 separate loan pools 
for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico, namely, for bright hull 
peanuts and for dark hull peanuts separately, to include for each of 
them separate, by segregation, additional peanuts and quota peanuts 
pools. Each marketing association shall maintain separate, complete and 
accurate records for each loan pool that is established by the marketing 
association.
    (2) Eligibility to participate in New Mexico Pools--(i) In general. 
Except as provided in clause (a)(2)(ii) of this section, in the case of 
the 1996 and subsequent crops, Valencia peanuts not physically produced 
in the State of New Mexico shall not be eligible to participate in the 
pools of the State even if the farm on which the peanuts are produced is 
constituted for administrative purposes within the State of New Mexico.
    (ii) Exception. A producer of Valencia peanuts may enter Valencia 
peanuts that are physically produced in Texas into the pools for New 
Mexico in a quantity not greater than the average annual quantity of the 
peanuts that the producer entered into the New Mexico pools for the 1990 
through 1995 crops; however, to qualify, the peanuts must be produced on 
the same farm on which the peanuts were produced during the base years 
of 1990 through 1995.
    (b) Net gains for quota pools. Net gains from peanuts in each quota 
pool shall consist of the amount by which the proceeds from the sale of 
the peanuts in such pool are in excess of the indebtedness on the 
peanuts in such pool.
    (c) Net gains for additional pool. Net gains for peanuts in each 
additional pool shall consist of:
    (1) The net gains which are in excess of the indebtedness on the 
peanuts placed in such pool; less
    (2) Any amount as provided in paragraph (d) of this section that is 
allocated to offset any loss on the pools for Segregation 1 quota 
peanuts, and any other amount properly offset.

[[Page 583]]

    (d) Recovery of losses in quota area loan pools. (1) If the loan 
indebtedness on the peanuts in a quota area pool exceeds the proceeds 
from the sale of the peanuts in such pool, such excess shall be 
recovered using the following sources in the following order of 
priority:
    (i) Proceeds due any individual producer from any pool, as a result 
of the transfer of peanuts for pricing purposes from an additional loan 
pool to a quota loan pool, pursuant to the provisions in Sec. 1446.307.
    (ii) Gains of any producer in the same pool, by the amount of pool 
gains attributed to the same producer from the sale of additional 
peanuts for domestic and export edible use.
    (iii) Gains or profits resulting from the sale of additional 
peanuts, other than Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico in separate 
type pools established under paragraph (a) of this section, in the same 
marketing area for domestic edible use, that are owned or controlled by 
CCC. This paragraph shall not apply to gains or profits from the sale of 
peanuts that were produced on farms with 1 acre or less of peanut 
production.
    (iv) Marketing assessments, collected from producers under 
Sec. 729.316 of this title, that the Secretary determines are necessary 
to cover losses in area quota pools.
    (v) Gains or profits from quota pools in other marketing areas, 
other than separate type pools established under paragraph (a) of this 
section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico.
    (vi) Gains or profits resulting from the sale of additional peanuts 
in other marketing areas, other than Valencia peanuts produced in New 
Mexico in separate type pools established under paragraph (a) of this 
section, for domestic edible use, that are owned or controlled by CCC. 
This paragraph shall not apply to gains or profits from the sale of 
peanuts that were produced on farms with 1 acre or less of peanut 
production.
    (vii) Marketing assessments, collected from handlers under 
Sec. 729.316 of this title, that the Secretary determines are necessary 
to cover losses in area quota pools.
    (viii) Increased marketing assessments on quota peanuts in the 
production area covered by the pool, which shall be assessed as needed 
and collected from producers under Sec. 729.317 of this title.
    (2) The exceptions provided for Valencia peanuts in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section shall only apply as to prevent offsets between pools for 
each of the Valencia types (bright-hull and dark-hull) for New Mexico 
and other peanuts.
    (e) Pool distribution. (1) Net gains as determined in accordance 
with this section on peanuts in each area pool shall be distributed to 
each producer who placed peanuts in that pool in proportion to the 
dollar value of peanuts placed in such pool by that producer, except 
that the proceeds available for the amount of distribution shall be 
subject to any other conditions and offsets set forth in this section; 
and
    (2) Distributions shall not be assigned to any other party.
    (f) Loan indebtedness. With respect to determining the gains and 
losses in accordance with this section for loan pools for quota and 
additional peanuts, the term ``indebtedness'' with respect to a pool 
shall include, but is not limited to, the following expenses associated 
with such peanuts:
    (1) Loan advance to producers.
    (2) Inspection fees.
    (3) Storage and handling charges.
    (4) Shelling costs.
    (5) Transportation and related charges.
    (6) Administrative and supervision expenses.
    (7) Interest applicable to any repayable amount.

Sec. 1446.309  Immediate buyback and sale of loan peanuts to the storing handler.

    (a) ``Immediate buyback'' purchase of additional peanuts--(1) 
Producer consent. Except as provided in this section, if the producer of 
a lot of additional peanuts has consented to an ``immediate buyback'' of 
such peanuts by a handler, as indicated by a designation recorded on the 
form FSA-1002, the handler that

[[Page 584]]

acts for the marketing association in advancing funds to the producer 
for a price support loan at the additional loan rate on such peanuts may 
purchase such peanuts from the marketing association for domestic edible 
use in accordance with instructions from the marketing association and 
at a price equal to 100 percent of the quota loan value of such peanuts 
plus a handling charge, as determined by the marketing association and 
approved by CCC, to cover all costs incurred with respect to such 
peanuts for inspection, warehousing, shrinkage, and other expenses.
    (2) Time for buyback purchase. An ``immediate buyback'' purchase may 
be made only in connection with the marketing association involved in 
the price support loan and only on the date on which the peanuts were 
delivered by the producer as collateral for a price support loan. Such 
sales are for the account of CCC.
    (3) Handler requirements. For each ``immediate buyback,'' the 
handler shall:
    (i) Act for the marketing association by making a price support 
advance to the producer at the additional loan rate and in the same 
manner that would be applicable if an ``immediate buyback'' were not 
involved;
    (ii) If applicable, use such handler's funds to pay to the producer 
any premiums that the parties had agreed upon in order to effect the 
delivery of such peanuts;
    (iii) Pay for the peanuts by a check made payable to CCC. Such check 
must be from the handler's funds and in an amount equal to the quota 
loan value of the peanuts plus any handling charges; and
    (iv) Transmit the handler's check and the applicable form FSA-1007 
to the marketing association by midnight of the third workday (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) following the day the peanuts 
were inspected.
    (4) Domestic edible use. The handler's check and the applicable form 
FSA-1007 will identify the peanuts as additional peanuts that may be 
used for domestic edible use.
    (5) Loan pool credit. Irrespective of the segregation of such 
peanuts, the receipts from the ``immediate buyback'' sale will be 
credited to the additional loan pool for Segregation 1 peanuts and the 
peanuts will be treated as Segregation 1 peanuts for pool accounting 
purposes.
    (6) Loan pool participation. If Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 
peanuts are purchased by a handler under the ``immediate buyback'' 
provisions, the producer of such peanuts shall participate in the 
Segregation 1 additional loan pool in the same manner as would apply if 
such peanuts had been Segregation 1 peanuts.
    (7) Additional restrictions on ``immediate buyback'' sales. (i) 
Additional peanuts of the type or Segregation contracted for export or 
crushing from a farm may not be purchased from such farm under the 
``immediate buyback'' provisions of this section until all of the 
producer's contracts for additional peanuts for the relevant crop year 
have been satisfied for the type or Segregation to be used for the 
buyback, as evidenced by a contract balance of zero for that type or 
Segregation of peanuts on the farm's marketing card;
    (ii) An immediate buyback that otherwise is prohibited by paragraph 
(a)(7)(i) of this section may be permitted by CCC in the case of any 
producer on a farm who does not share in the additional peanuts for 
which there is a contract.
    (iii) An agreement between the handler and producer to void a 
contract that was approved in accordance with this part shall not reduce 
the balance shown on the producer's marketing card for contract 
additional peanuts and until such contract is renewed and satisfied the 
producer's additional peanuts of the same type or Segregation as were 
covered by that contract shall not be eligible for that crop year for 
purchase under an ``immediate buyback.''
    (b) Purchase of quota or additional loan peanuts. Quota loan 
peanuts, or additional loan peanuts that were not purchased by the 
handler under the ``immediate buyback'' provisions, may be bought for 
domestic edible use in accordance with this paragraph on an in-grade and 
in-weight basis.

[[Page 585]]

    (1) In-grade and in-weight purchases. A handler may purchase loan 
peanuts, either quota or additional, on an in-grade and in-weight basis 
for domestic edible use:
    (i) Under terms and conditions established by the marketing 
association and CCC;
    (ii) If such peanuts are eligible for domestic edible use; and
    (iii) If such peanuts are stored in a warehouse that is operated by 
such handler.
    (2) Pricing. Except with respect to ``immediate buybacks,'' as 
provided for in this section, the price for peanuts purchased on an in-
grade and in-weight basis shall be determined by the marketing 
association or CCC, as applicable, for the account of CCC, but shall not 
be less than the applicable carrying charges plus, with respect to each 
lot of peanuts purchased:
    (i) 105 percent of the quota loan value that was or would be 
applicable to the quantity of loan peanuts in such lot, if paid for not 
later than December 31 of the marketing year; or
    (ii) 107 percent of the quota loan value that was or would be 
applicable to the quantity of loan peanuts in such lot, if paid for 
after December 31 of the marketing year.

   Subpart D--Handling Contract Additional Peanuts--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1446.401  Contracts for additional peanuts for crushing or export.

    An approved handler may contract with a producer to deliver 
additional peanuts for exporting or for crushing. In order to be valid, 
the contract must meet the eligibility requirements in this section and 
must be approved by the county committee that serves the county in which 
the producing farm is located for administrative purposes.
    (a) Contract form and addendum--(1) Contract form. In order to be 
approved by the county committee, the contract must be completed on Form 
CCC-1005, Handler Contract With Producers for Purchase of Additional 
Peanuts for Crushing or Export, or on a form approved by the Executive 
Vice President, CCC, or designee, which follows the organization of the 
CCC-1005 and contains as a minimum all of the requirements provided for 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Availability of CCC-1005. The marketing association shall make 
available a form CCC-1005 to each approved handler and to any producer 
upon request.
    (3) Addenda. The handler may use an addendum to a contract form if 
such addendum neither negates nor conflicts with any provision in this 
part. Any existing addendum to the contract which relates to the 
marketing of additional peanuts must accompany the contract at the time 
the contract is filed with the county committee.
    (b) Submitting contracts for approval--(1) Eligible handlers. Only a 
handler who has been approved by the marketing

[[Page 586]]

association to handle contract additional peanuts may contract with 
producers to buy additional peanuts for crushing or exportation, or 
both.
    (2) Producer-handlers. A person who has been approved as a producer-
handler under part 1421 of this title may not contract with himself/
herself to purchase contract additional peanuts that he/she may produce.
    (3) Place and time for submitting. In order to be considered for 
approval, any contract between a handler and producer for the purchase 
of additional peanuts shall be completed and submitted:
    (i) Place. To the county FSA office of the county in which the farm 
is administratively located.
    (ii) Time. On or before September 15 of the year in which the crop 
is produced; except that:
    (A) Should September 15 fall on a Saturday or Sunday, or other non-
workday the contract must be submitted for approval no later than the 
last workday immediately preceding the final contracting date.
    (B) If the Executive Vice President, CCC, determines that damaging 
weather such as drought, hail, excessive moisture, freeze, tornado, 
hurricane or excessive wind, or related condition such as insect 
infestations, plant diseases, or other deterioration of the peanut crop, 
including aflatoxin, is expected to have significant national impact on 
peanut production, the Executive Vice President may extend nationally, 
by up to 15 days, the final date for submitting contracts for approval. 
Such announcement shall be made no later than September 5 of the year in 
which the crop is produced.
    (c) Contract approval. (1) A contract between a handler and a 
producer for additional peanuts for crushing or export shall not be 
approved by the county committee, if otherwise eligible, unless the 
county committee has been notified by the State Executive Director that 
the handler has been approved to contract additional peanuts and that 
such handler has submitted the letter of credit that is required in 
accordance with the provisions in this part.
    (2) In order to be approved, the following information must appear 
on the contract:
    (i) The name and address of the operator;

a set percentage of the loan rate for quota peanuts of the type 
indicated on the contract; except that such final contract price shall 
not be less than the additional loan rate for the type of peanut 
indicated on the contract. A contract or an addendum to a contract that 
provides for a conditional supplemental payment to the producer will not 
be considered to negate the final contract price only if the 
supplemental payment to be made is expressed in a manner that a third 
party may determine the amount of the supplemental payment without a 
need for additional negotiations;
    (vii) A disclosure by the producer of any liens or encumbrances on 
the peanuts;
    (viii) The signature of the farm operator;
    (ix) The signature of each person having an interest as a producer 
in the contract additional peanuts that are produced on the farm;

<R05>
Sec. 1446.402  Approval as handler of contract additional peanuts.

    (a) General. By June 15 preceding the beginning of the marketing 
year in which such additional peanuts will be

[[Page 587]]

acquired, any handler who plans to acquire contract additional peanuts 
in accordance with this part for crushing or for exporting must:
    (1) Application. File an application with each marketing association 
that serves the area in which such handler plans to acquire contract 
additional peanuts. Such application:
    (i) Form. Must be on a form or in a format provided by the marketing 
association.
    (ii) Method of supervision. Must indicate the method of supervision, 
physical or nonphysical, selected by the handler for purposes of 
accounting for the disposition of any contract additional peanuts 
acquired by such handler.
    (2) Evidence of adequate assets and adequate facilities. Provide 
evidence that is acceptable to the marketing association and CCC that 
such handler has:
    (i) Assets. Adequate assets to assure compliance with the provisions 
in this part with respect to such handler's obligation to crush or 
export contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler; and
    (ii) Facilities. Adequate facilities to handle the acquisition and 
disposition of any contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler.
    (3) Letter of credit for prior crop years. Establish an irrevocable 
letter of credit, or increase any existing letter of credit applicable 
for a previous crop year, in an amount necessary to cover any 
outstanding marketing penalties on peanuts produced in such crop year 
which are still under administrative appeal or are unpaid. This 
requirement is in addition to any letter of credit requirement for the 
current year.
    (b) Approval. The marketing association, acting on behalf of CCC, 
shall approve, in accordance with this part, each application that is 
timely filed in accordance with this section, or is filed by such 
extended time as may be approved by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
provided that in either case, the applicant:
    (1) Has selected a method of supervision;
    (2) Has a U.S. address;
    (3) Has provided evidence of adequate assets and adequate facilities 
to assure compliance with the provisions in this part with respect to 
the disposition of contract additional peanuts; and
    (4) Has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) Rescission of approval. Unless the Executive Vice President, 
CCC, shall otherwise agree in writing, a handler's previous approval to 
contract for the purchase of additional peanuts for exporting or 
crushing and to receive and handle such peanuts shall be considered to 
be rescinded upon such handler's use of facilities, other than those on 
which the approval was based, to receive, store, process, or ship 
contract additional peanuts. However, a rescission will not apply if 
substituted facilities are approved by the association, in accordance 
with instructions issued by CCC, when the handler can show, as 
determined by the association subject to review by the Executive Vice 
President, that the original facilities are no longer available for use 
due to circumstances beyond the handler's control such as, but not 
limited to, fire, flood, wind damage, or mechanical failure. In the 
event of rescission of a handler's approval, any purchases of peanuts 
from producers by such handler subsequent to the rescission will be 
considered as purchases of quota peanuts and will subject the handlers 
and producers to penalties, as prescribed by this part and in 7 CFR part 
729 for marketing excess quota peanuts unless such peanuts are recorded 
on the producer's marketing card as a marketing of quota peanuts.
    (d) Cost of supervision. The handler shall bear the cost of 
supervision irrespective of the method of supervision such handler has 
chosen.

Sec. 1446.403  Letter of credit.

    (a) Certification and financial guarantee (letter of credit)--(1) 
Certification. In order to establish a letter of credit, each handler 
must certify to the applicable marketing association the quantity of 
additional peanuts the handler expects to contract for delivery by 
producers that are served by such marketing association. The certified

[[Page 588]]

poundage will be the basis for establishing the letter of credit for the 
applicable crop. If the certified poundage is less than the actual 
contracted poundage, the letter of credit required of the handler for 
the next marketing year shall be subject to increase, as provided in 
this section.
    (2) Letter of credit. The handler must present an irrevocable letter 
of credit to each marketing association that serves the area in which a 
handler plans to contract or otherwise acquire contract additional 
peanuts. Such letter of credit shall be issued in a form and by a bank 
which is acceptable to CCC and except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section shall be submitted to the appropriate marketing association 
not later than July 31 and before marketing cards will be issued to 
producers for contract additional peanuts. Unless the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are applicable, the amount of the 
letter of credit for each area shall be equal to the amount determined 
by multiplying 140 percent of the national average quota price support 
rate by, for a handler selecting nonphysical supervision, 8 percent, or, 
for a handler selecting physical supervision, 5 percent, of the larger 
of:
    (i) Ninety percent of the handler's contracted pounds as recorded on 
contracts approved by the county committee for the preceding marketing 
year and in the marketing area; or
    (ii) The amount of additional peanuts the handler estimates will be 
contracted with producers, as certified to the marketing association, 
for delivery during the current marketing year and in that marketing 
area.
    (b) Increase in letter of credit. (1) The amount of the letter of 
credit required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be increased 
for any handler:
    (i) Who has a poor performance record, as evidenced by previous 
penalty assessments for violations of the provisions of this part; or
    (ii) Who, for purposes of handling peanuts is, as determined by CCC, 
a partnership, merger, joint venture, or other similar business 
relationship having officials who were officials of an organization 
having such a record or is composed in whole or in part by merger, 
succession, consolidation, association or assimilation, of entities with 
such a record; or
    (iii) Whose total acquisition of farmers stock peanuts during the 
preceding marketing year from purchases of contract additional peanuts 
exceeded, by more than 3.0 percent, the pounds on which the letter of 
credit for the preceding marketing year was based. Nothing in this part 
shall prohibit CCC from demanding an increase in the letter of credit 
for the current year in the event the handler has significantly 
underestimated the handler's purchases for the current year.
    (2) The increase in the letter of credit shall be determined in 
accordance with the guidelines set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Guidelines for increasing letters of credit--(1) Increased 
letter of credit due to history of program violation. If the handler 
and/or related entity was assessed penalties for program violations for 
any of the previous three crop years, the percentage of the pounds of 
contracted peanuts to which the increase specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section shall be applied, shall be increased by 6 percent for each 
year of the three-year period in which such a penalty was assessed, 
except that:
    (i) Such increase for a particular crop year shall be 3 percent 
rather than 6 percent if, for all violations for that crop year:
    (A) The penalties were reduced by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
and paid; or
    (B) Less than 120 days, or such further period as established by the 
Executive Vice President, have passed since the penalty assessment was 
made by the CCC Contracting Officer.
    (ii) Previous penalty assessments, other than assessments for 
violations that involve the importation of additional peanuts, or the 
failure to properly dispose of additional peanuts, which have been paid 
shall not be considered as part of the violation history for any crop 
year if the total violations for such crop year by the handler, and 
related individuals or entities, involved less than 100,000 pounds of 
peanuts.
    (2) Waiver of increase. Notwithstanding (c)(1) of this section, at 
the

[[Page 589]]

discretion of the Executive Vice President, CCC, the increase required 
under this section may be waived upon the presentment of adequate 
security as determined acceptable by the Executive Vice President, CCC.
    (3) Inaccurate certification of additional peanuts acquired. In 
addition to the increase required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
if the actual purchase of contract additional peanuts for the previous 
marketing year exceeds, by more than 3.0 percent, the poundage on which 
the previous marketing year's letter of credit was based, the pounds 
determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section shall be increased by an amount equal to 3 times the amount of 
such excess.
    (4) Basis for determining letter of credit amount. Any letter of 
credit determination under this section shall be based upon the facts as 
they exist on June 1 of the calendar year in which the letter of credit 
is to be supplied.
    (5) Unpaid interest. References to unpaid penalties in this section 
shall include associated unpaid interest and unpaid late payment 
charges.
    (d) Extension of time for filing letter of credit. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this section, upon a request from a handler, the 
Executive Vice President, CCC, may extend the time for filing of a 
required letter of credit if such an extension is considered necessary 
in order for the handler to have sufficient time to acquire necessary 
financing.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.404  Transfer of contracts prior to delivery.

    An approved contract, by which a handler is to purchase additional 
peanuts from a producer, may not be sold, traded, or assigned except as 
provided in this section.
    (a) Contract transfer and delivery of contracted peanuts to other 
handlers. (1) If a handler is otherwise unable to perform under any 
contract with a producer for the purchase of additional peanuts due to 
conditions beyond the handler's control, the handler and the producer 
may agree to the delivery of the peanuts to another handler under the 
terms of the original contract or under modified terms except that, the 
price, quantity, type, segregation or farm number as shown on the 
original contract may not be changed. Conditions considered beyond the 
handler's control may include, but are not limited to, insolvency, 
bankruptcy, death, or destruction of warehouse facilities.
    (2) A contract for additional peanuts shall not be transferred to 
another handler without the prior written approval of the Deputy 
Administrator. Such transfer shall be approved by the Deputy 
Administrator only if the Deputy Administrator determines that such 
transfer will not impair the effective operation of the peanut program.
    (3) If the receiving handler:
    (i) Has an existing letter of credit, such handler may increase the 
existing letter of credit to cover the total amount of farmers stock 
peanuts that is to be transferred. However, any increase must be made 
within 14 days after the transfer is approved, otherwise any increased 
letter of credit will not be considered for purposes of determining 
whether an increase will be required in the next year's letter of credit 
because of a deficiency in the letter of credit.
    (ii) Does not have an existing letter of credit, the transfer shall 
not be approved unless such handler secures an acceptable letter of 
credit to cover the amount of farmers stock peanuts that is to be 
transferred.
    (b) Contract transfer and transfer of delivery obligations to other 
producers. If a producer is unable to fully perform the terms of a 
contract with a handler for the purchase of additional peanuts due to 
conditions beyond the producer's control or other conditions as may be 
prescribed by CCC, the handler and the producer or the producer's 
successor-in-interest may agree to a modification of the contract or to 
the substitution of another producer either under the original terms of 
the contract or under modified terms that do not change the original 
contract price and quantity. Conditions considered to be beyond the 
producer's control may include, but are not limited to, farm 
reconstitution in some cases (combinations and divisions), insolvency, 
bankruptcy, or death but do not include failure to produce the 
contracted amount from

[[Page 590]]

the planted acreage of peanuts due to natural disaster or related 
conditions or failure to plant sufficient acreage to produce the 
contracted quantity. Such modifications or transfers of contract 
obligations shall not be valid without the prior written approval of the 
Deputy Administrator. A transfer shall be approved only if the Deputy 
Administrator determines that such modifications or such transfer will 
not impair the effective operation of the peanut program.
    (c) County committee approval. Contract modifications other than 
changes in producer, owner or operator, or changes permitted by this 
section, may not be approved by the county committee.

    (a) Liability and credit for export or crushing. Except as permitted 
by this section, a handler shall not:
    (1) Sell, assign or otherwise transfer liability for exporting or 
crushing contract additional peanuts to other handlers, or
    (2) Sell, assign, or otherwise transfer credits for exporting or 
crushing contract additional peanuts to other handlers.
    (b) Transfer of farmers stock contract additional peanuts. (1) A

applicant 2 on the form FSA-1007 for the peanuts.
    (2) Such transfers shall be made within the same marketing area 
unless approved otherwise by the marketing association or the Deputy 
Administrator, and in accordance with instructions issued by CCC.
    (3) Before the transfer may be approved, the receiving handler's 
letter of credit shall be amended by an amount that will cover the 
amount of peanuts transferred and the transferring handler must submit 
to the marketing association for approval, a form CCC-1006, covering any 
proposed transfer of farmers stock peanuts.
    (4) Such approval must be obtained before any physical movement of 
the peanuts from the buying point.
    (5) The transfer of peanuts as farmers stock peanuts after sale by 
the producer shall not be permitted unless approved in writing by CCC or

this section.
    (2) Such transfer shall be made in accordance with the provisions of 
this part.

credit for export is submitted with the applicable form FV-184-9, the 
export credit will be transferred to the

[[Page 591]]

person to whom the credit was assigned.
    (e) Transfer of credit for crushing. Disposition credit earned for 
peanuts crushed in accordance with the provisions of this part and under 
the supervision of the marketing association may be assigned to another 
person if a disclaimer to the credit for crushing is submitted with the 
applicable form FV-184-9.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.408  Decreasing or drawing upon a letter of credit.

    (a) Decreasing the letter of credit to reflect TKC obligation. Any 
existing irrevocable letter of credit that has been presented by a 
handler may be decreased after January 31 of the calendar year following 
the year in which the peanuts were produced, or such earlier date as may 
be authorized by the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, 
if the final TKC obligation determined for such handler, when converted 
to a farmers stock peanuts basis by dividing the TKC pounds by 0.795 for 
runner peanuts; 0.75 for Spanish peanuts; 0.735 for Virginia peanuts; or 
0.77 for Valencia peanuts, is less than the amount that would be 
applicable for such handler and for such amount of farmers stock peanuts 
as determined in accordance with Sec. 1446.403 of this part. The letter 
of credit may be decreased to the amount so determined.
    (b) Adjusting the letter of credit for acceptable proof of 
disposition. The handler shall deliver to the marketing association 
satisfactory evidence as described in this part, to verify that contract 
additional peanuts have been exported or otherwise disposed of in 
accordance with the provisions of this part. On January 31, of the 
calendar year following the year in which the peanuts were produced, and 
monthly thereafter of such following year, the marketing association 
shall permit a reduction of the letter of credit if the existing letter 
of credit exceeds 140 percent of the national average quota price 
support rate for the applicable crop times the farmers stock equivalent 
of the remaining TKC obligation as determined in the same manner as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Drawing against the letter of credit. (1) If less than 16 days 
remain before the expiration of a handler's letter of credit, and upon 
authorization by CCC, the marketing association may draw against the 
letter of credit and apply the amount toward any penalty due for failure 
to properly dispose of, or account for, contract additional peanuts in 
accordance with this part if:
    (i) By the final disposition date required in this part, a 
deficiency remained in the handler's obligation to crush or export 
contract additional peanuts;
    (ii) By the date required in this part, the handler did not provide 
satisfactory documentary evidence of the full export of peanuts or 
peanut products; or
    (iii) The handler has committed another violation of this part with 
respect to such peanuts.
    (2) Any draw down against a letter of credit shall not compromise 
any penalty due CCC if the letter of credit is insufficient to cover the 
full amount of the penalty or prevent any re-determination of whether 
there has been a proper disposition of and/or accounting for peanuts.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.409  Access to facilities.

    A handler, by entering into contracts to receive contract additional 
peanuts, or any person or firm otherwise receiving contract additional 
peanuts, shall be considered to have agreed that any authorized 
representative of CCC or the marketing association:
    (a) May enter and remain upon any of the premises of the handler 
when such peanuts are being received, shelled, cleaned, bagged, sealed, 
weighed, graded, stored, milled, blanched, crushed, packaged, shipped, 
sized, processed into products, or otherwise handled;
    (b) May inspect such peanuts and the oil, meal, and other products 
thereof; and
    (c) May inspect the premises, facilities, operations, books, and 
records of the handler to the extent necessary to determine that such 
peanuts have been handled in accordance with this part.

[[Page 592]]


<R05>
Sec. 1446.410  Disposition date.

    (a) Final disposition date. To avoid a penalty as provided in this 
part, a handler shall dispose of all contract additional peanuts, in 
accordance with the provisions in this part, by the final disposition 
date. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the final 
disposition date shall be October 15 of the year following the calendar 
year in which the crop was grown.
    (b) Extension of final disposition date. The final disposition date 
for an individual handler may be extended by the marketing association 
to November 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the crop 
was grown if, by the final disposition date identified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the handler files a written request with the marketing 
association that specifies the number of pounds for which an extension 
is requested.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.411  Export provisions.

    (a) Export to a U.S. Government agency. Except for the exportation 
of raw peanuts to the military exchange services of the United States 
for processing outside the United States, the export of peanuts in any 
form by or to a United States Government agency shall not be considered 
as export to an eligible country, but shall instead be considered a 
domestic edible use of such peanuts. However, sales to a foreign 
government which are financed with funds made available by a United 
States agency, such as the Agency for International Development or CCC, 
will not be considered sales to a United States Government agency if the 
peanuts are not purchased by the foreign buyer for transfer to an agency 
of the United States.
    (b) Export to an eligible country. All contract additional peanuts 
which are not crushed domestically (including approved processing into 
flakes) and which are eligible for export shall be exported in 
accordance with the provisions of this part to an eligible country as 
peanuts or peanut products.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.412  Evidence of export.

    To receive credit toward an obligation to dispose of contract 
additional peanuts in accordance with this part, the handler must:
    (a) Certified statement. Provide a statement signed by the handler

peanuts have been exported.
    (b) Documentation. Not later than 45 days after the final

the Director, TPD, for cases where the Director finds that the handler 
has made a good faith effort to furnish documentation in a timely manner 
and that the failure to do so was due to conditions beyond the control 
of the handler, furnish to the marketing association or CCC the 
following documentary evidence of the export of peanuts or peanut 
products:
    (1) Export by water. For peanuts or peanut products and peanut 
products that were exported by water, a nonnegotiable original or

Sec. 1446.413  Disposal of meal contaminated by aflatoxin.

    All meal produced from peanuts which are crushed domestically and 
found to be unsuitable for use as feed because of contamination by 
aflatoxin shall be disposed of for non-feed purposes only. If the meal 
is exported, the export bill of lading shall reflect the analysis of the 
lot by inclusion and appropriate completion thereon the following 
statement showing the range and average aflatoxin content (where ``----

Sec. 1446.414  Processing additional peanuts into products.

    (a) Type of supervision. A person, who plans to acquire additional 
peanuts from other handlers for processing into products for export, 
must register as a handler and choose a method of supervision in 
accordance with this section.
    (b) Physical supervision. For purposes of this section, if physical 
supervision is chosen:
    (1) Such supervision shall be conducted in accordance with 
provisions of this part; and
    (2) The processor must provide a letter of credit to the marketing 
association as prescribed by this part which shall, to the extent 
practicable, be the same amount as the letter of credit that would be 
required in accordance with this part for an equal quantity of peanuts 
acquired by a handler who has entered into contracts for the purchase of 
additional peanuts and has chosen physical supervision.
    (c) Nonphysical supervision. For purposes of this section, if 
nonphysical supervision is chosen:
    (1) The processor shall:
    (i) Provide a written agreement that is signed by a duly authorized 
person, in which the processor agrees to export additional peanuts to an 
eligible country in such quantities and in accordance with such 
procedures as are specified by this part;
    (ii) Provide a letter of credit to the marketing association which 
shall, to the extent practicable, be the same amount as the letter of 
credit that would be required in accordance with this part for an equal 
quantity of peanuts acquired by a handler who has entered into contracts 
for the purchase of additional peanuts and has chosen nonphysical 
supervision; and
    (iii) Provide to the marketing association a description of the type 
of product that will be processed, the type of containers, size of 
containers, and the standard peanut processing yield for the product.
    (2) The processor shall submit proof of export to the marketing 
association of like kind, as determined by the marketing association, as 
that required by this part for exports of peanuts under nonphysical 
supervision.
    (3) Upon verification of product yield by the marketing association, 
approval of the form CCC-1006, and approval of the letter of credit, a 
product export obligation will be established on marketing association 
ledgers and the processor will be notified of the quantity of product 
export obligation.
    (4) Upon receipt of proof of export that is acceptable to the 
marketing association, the processor, with the concurrence of the 
marketing association, may reduce the letter of credit to the extent 
that such letter of credit exceeds the amount determined by the 
marketing association, in accordance with instructions issued by FSA, to 
be

[[Page 594]]

necessary to assure compliance by the processor with the provisions in 
this part.
    (d) Applicability of regulations. By registering as a handler and 
selecting a method of supervision in accordance with this section, a 
processor of peanuts shall be considered to have agreed:
    (1) To perform in accordance with the provisions of this part;
    (2) That the provisions of this part such as access to facilities, 
fraud, liens against peanuts on which penalty is due, and any other 
provisions that apply to a handler of additional peanuts, shall apply to 
the processor; and
    (3) That the processor shall be considered as a handler for purposes 
of applying the penalty provisions of this part.
    (e) Records. A peanut processor shall maintain records that will 
enable the marketing association or other representative of the 
Secretary to determine compliance with the provisions of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.415  Prohibition on importation or reentry of contract additional peanuts.

    Neither exported contract additional peanuts nor peanut products 
made from additional peanuts shall be imported or reentered in 
commercial quantities by anyone into the United States in any form. If 
contract additional peanuts or peanut products made from such peanuts 
are imported or reentered into the United States, the handler importing 
such peanuts or peanut products shall be liable for a penalty assessed 
in accordance with this part, for reentering contract additional 
peanuts.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.416  Suspension of restrictions on imported peanuts.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if the President 
issues a proclamation under Section 404(b) of the Uruguay Round 
Agreements Act (19 USCS Sec. 3601(b)) expanding the quantity of peanuts 
subject to the in-quota rate of duty under a tariff-rate quota, or under 
section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustments Act (7 U.S.C. 624), reenacted 
with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 
temporarily suspending restrictions on the importation of peanuts, a 
handler, with the written consent of the producer and CCC, may purchase 
additional peanuts from any producer who, in accordance with this part, 
contracted with the handler to deliver additional peanuts to such 
handler and may use such peanuts for sale for domestic edible use 
without incurring any marketing penalty for failure to crush or export 
such peanuts. However, the maximum quantity of peanuts that may be 
purchased by such handler in accordance with this provision of this 
section is the quantity of contract additional peanuts that remains 
undelivered by such producer under the contract. For purposes of 
application of this section, a proclamation temporarily increasing the 
import quota shall not be considered the same as a temporary suspension 
of restrictions on the importation of peanuts.

Sec. 1446.417  Loss of peanuts.

    Should a handler suffer a loss of peanuts as a result of fire, flood 
or any other condition beyond the control of the handler, the portion of 
such loss that may be attributed to contract additional peanuts, as 
determined by the marketing association shall not be greater than an 
amount determined by dividing the total of the contract additional 
peanuts acquired by the handler during the year by such handler's total 
peanut purchases for the year and multiplying the result by the quantity 
for which acceptable proof of loss has been furnished to the marketing 
association. Such attribution shall take into account any dispositions 
of peanuts that occurred prior to the loss of the peanuts for which the 
attribution is made.

  Subpart E--Handling Contract Additional Peanuts-Physical Supervision


<R05>
Sec. 1446.501  Accounting for contract additional peanuts acquired under physical supervision.

    (a) Commingled storage--(1) General. For a handler operating under 
physical

[[Page 595]]

supervision, contract additional peanuts placed in commingled storage 
must be accounted for on a dollar value basis less a one time adjustment 
for shrinkage for each crop.
    (2) Shrinkage. For peanuts that are graded out and accounted for:
    (i) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.
    (ii) After January 31 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.5 percent for all other peanuts.
    (3) Records. The handler shall maintain a copy of each form FSA-1007 
that was issued for any peanuts that are placed in commingled storage 
and that is issued for any peanuts removed from storage.
    (b) Supervised identity preserved storage. For a handler operating 
under physical supervision, contract additional peanuts may be stored 
identity preserved and may be accounted for by disposing of the entire 
contents of the peanuts in each identity preserved warehouse in 
accordance with this part and under the supervision of a representative 
of the marketing association. In such case:
    (1) All peanuts that are loaded into each warehouse must be 
inspected as farmers stock peanuts and must be loaded under the 
supervision of the marketing association.
    (2) At the end of each day in which peanuts are placed in or removed 
from the warehouse, the warehouse must be sealed by a representative of 
the marketing association.
    (3) Each warehouse seal may be removed only by a representative of 
the marketing association.
    (4) The marketing association shall be reimbursed by the handler for 
all expenses of providing a representative to supervise the loading and 
unloading of each warehouse.
    (c) Nonsupervised identity preserved storage--(1) Conditions. For a 
handler operating under physical supervision, contract additional 
peanuts may be stored identity preserved without supervision at the time 
of loading the peanuts into each warehouse, but only if:
    (i) All peanuts that are loaded into a warehouse are inspected prior 
to loading into such warehouse and a form FSA-1007 prepared for each lot 
that is inspected;
    (ii) The entire contents of each warehouse will be removed and 
disposed of in accordance with this part and under supervision of a 
representative of the marketing association; and
    (iii) The peanuts are accounted for on a dollar value basis except 
that shrinkage, in the amounts provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, will be allowed if the dollar value of the peanuts that are 
loaded out of each warehouse is less than the dollar value of the 
peanuts that were loaded into such warehouse.
    (2) Shrinkage. For peanuts that are graded out and accounted for:
    (i) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.
    (ii) After January 31 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.5 percent for all other peanuts.
    (3) Records. The handler shall maintain a copy of each form FSA-1007 
that is issued for any peanuts that are placed in nonsupervised identity 
preserved storage and that is issued for any peanuts that are removed 
from such storage.

Sec. 1446.502  Physical supervision of contract additional peanuts.

    (a) Supervision. A handler who has chosen to operate under physical 
supervision shall make arrangements that are satisfactory to the 
marketing association for representatives of the marketing association 
to conduct onsite supervision of domestic handling of contract 
additional peanuts including storing, shelling, crushing, cleaning, 
milling, blanching, weighing, and shipping.
    (b) Final dates for scheduling supervision. Contract additional 
farmers

[[Page 596]]

stock peanuts shall be scheduled for supervision by the marketing 
association during the normal marketing period but not later than August 
15 of the calendar year following the year in which the crop was grown, 
unless prior approval of a later date has been made by the marketing 
association.
    (c) Notifying the marketing association. Before moving or processing 
any contract additional peanuts, the handler or an agent of the handler 
shall notify the marketing association of the time such operation will 
begin and the approximate period of time required to complete the 
operation. When a plant is not currently under supervision, the handler 
shall give at least five working days of advance notice to the marketing 
association so that supervision can be arranged.
    (d) Processing. The identical peanuts identified at time of load-out 
as contract additional peanuts shall be shelled or otherwise milled, 
crushed, or shelled and crushed under supervision of the marketing 
association as a continuous operation separate from other peanuts. 
Shelled peanuts shall be identified with positive lot identity tags 
before being stored and moved for crushing, exportation, or processing 
into peanut products to be exported. Except as otherwise authorized by 
the marketing association, such peanuts will be considered as having 
been crushed or exported only if positive lot identity has been 
maintained in the following manner:
    (1) Transportation. The peanuts shall be transported from storage 
locations in a covered vehicle such as a truck or railroad car. The 
vehicle shall be sealed unless the marketing association determines that 
identity of the peanuts can be maintained without sealing.
    (2) Storage. Farmers stock peanuts shall be stored in a separate 
building(s) or bin(s) which can be sealed or which the marketing 
association otherwise determines will satisfactorily maintain lot 
identity. Milled peanuts shall be stored in such a manner that the 
marketing association, under procedures issued by CCC, may make periodic 
inventory verification of the contract additional lots that are shown on 
marketing association records as being in the storage facility. The 
handler shall furnish to the marketing association the name and location 
of the storage facilities in which the contract additional peanuts are 
located.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.503  Disposition requirements under physical supervision.

    (a) Methods of disposition. Except under the provisions of 
Sec. 1446.504 of this part applicable to substitution, the identical 
contract additional farmers stock peanuts and milled peanuts that are 
shelled under supervision of the marketing association and formed into 
lots shall be disposed of, in accordance with the provisions of this 
part that are applicable to contract additional peanuts and to physical 
supervision, by domestic crushing or by export to an eligible country as 
follows:
    (1) All kernels may be crushed domestically under supervision of the 
marketing association representative; or
    (2) All kernels may be exported for crushing, if fragmented; or
    (3) All kernels that meet the standards established for the domestic 
market under the Marketing Agreement No.146 may be exported and the 
remaining kernels crushed domestically under supervision of the 
marketing association representative; or
    (4) All of the peanuts may be exported as farmers stock peanuts, 
provided that such peanuts meet the standards established for the 
domestic market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146 and are positive 
lot identified; or
    (5) The peanuts may be exported to an eligible country as peanut 
products if such products are produced domestically; or
    (6) The peanuts may be exported as milled or in-shell peanuts if 
they meet the edible export standards established for the domestic 
market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146; or
    (7) The peanuts may be considered exported or crushed if it is 
determined by CCC that such peanuts have been destroyed or otherwise 
made unsuitable for any commercial purpose.
    (b) Peanuts diverted. Contract additional peanuts, or peanut 
products made from contract additional peanuts, that are diverted to any 
country

[[Page 597]]

other than an eligible country shall not be credited in the handler's 
favor against the handler's obligation to crush or export such peanuts.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.504  Substitution of quota and additional peanuts.

    (a) Substitution of quota peanuts which have been exported--(1) 
Farmers stock peanuts. With prior notification to and approval of the 
marketing association, farmers stock quota peanuts that have been 
exported from the same crop, type, quality, and area may be substituted 
for additional peanuts that otherwise would have to be exported in 
accordance with this part to avoid a penalty.
    (2) Milled peanuts. With prior notification to and approval by the 
marketing association, peanuts that are milled under supervision of the 
marketing association may be used to replace, in domestic edible use, 
quota peanuts that have been exported to an eligible country from the 
same crop, type, area, and of the same grade as recognized by the Peanut 
Administrative Committee (PAC) for edible quality grades. Such grades 
shall be established at the time the peanuts are milled and the lot is 
formed unless CCC directs otherwise in writing. The quota peanuts that 
are exported, for which substitution is requested, must have been 
positive lot identified and otherwise handled as additional peanuts 
under the supervision of the marketing association.
    (b) Use of additional peanuts for domestic edible uses prior to 
substitution--(1) General requirements. Additional peanuts may be used 
for domestic edible use with prior notification and approval of the 
marketing association and upon presentation to the marketing association 
of an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount that is determined in 
the same manner as such handler's initial letter of credit for the 
quantity of peanuts that will be substituted. Such letter of credit is 
in addition to the letter of credit required in accordance this part as 
a condition for approval of contracts for additional peanuts. Such 
additional letter of credit for substitution shall be issued in a form 
and by a bank which is acceptable to CCC.
    (2) Submitting evidence of export. The handler subsequently shall 
dispose of a like amount of quota peanuts in the manner prescribed in 
this part for contract additional peanuts. If the quota peanuts are 
exported, the handler shall subsequently deliver to the marketing 
association satisfactory evidence that a like amount of quota peanuts of 
the same type and of a similar grade has been exported. Such evidence 
must be submitted no later than the earlier of:
    (i) 30 days after the final date for export as established in 
accordance with this part; or
    (ii) 15 days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit.
    (3) Failure to timely submit evidence of export. If satisfactory 
evidence is not presented by such date determined in (b)(2) of this 
section, CCC may authorize the marketing association to draw against the 
letter of credit for the full amount of the penalty which would 
otherwise be due for failure to dispose of contract additional peanuts 
in accordance with this part.


<R04>
Subpart F--Handling Contract Additional Peanuts--Nonphysical Supervision


<R05>
Sec. 1446.601  Disposition requirements under nonphysical supervision.

    (a) Disposition requirement. With respect to any marketing year, a 
handler who has selected nonphysical supervision shall account for the 
disposition of any contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler 
by providing evidence that is satisfactory to the marketing association 
of the quantity of peanuts by peanut type that are crushed or exported 
by such handler in each of the following kernel categories:
    (1) SS kernels;
    (2) SMK's; and
    (3) AO kernels.
    (b) SS kernels. (1) For each lot of contract additional peanuts 
acquired by such handler for which a deduction would have been 
applicable for SS kernels under the applicable price support loan 
schedule, deduct, from the percentage of SS kernels in such lot of 
peanuts, a number of percentage points equal to the maximum percentage 
of

[[Page 598]]

SS kernels that a lot of peanuts could contain without having a 
deduction for SS kernels under the applicable price support loan 
schedule and multiply the result by the total weight of the TKC content 
of the lot, excluding the weight of the LSK's in such lot.
    (2) Determine separately, for each type of peanuts acquired by such 
handler, the total of the results obtained in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section for all lots of contract additional peanuts acquired by such 
handler.
    (3) For each type of peanuts acquired by such handler, multiply the 
result determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by 0.955 in order 
to provide an allowance for shrinkage. The result is the minimum 
quantity of SS kernels of peanuts of the respective type that shall be 
crushed or exported by such handler.
    (c) SMK and SS kernels. (1) Determine, by type, the total of the 
quantity of SMK and SS kernels in the lots of contract additional 
peanuts acquired during the marketing year by such handler.
    (2) From the total determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
deduct the amount determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (3) For each type of peanuts acquired by such handler, multiply the 
results obtained in (c)(2) of this section by 0.955. The result is the 
minimum combined quantity of SMK's and SS kernels (excluding the 
quantity of SS kernels required to be crushed or exported as determined 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) of the respective type that shall 
be exported or crushed by such handler.
    (d) AO kernels. (1) Determine, by type, the total quantity of TKC in 
the lots of contract additional peanuts acquired during the marketing 
year by such handler.
    (2) From the total determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
deduct:
    (i) The amount of SS kernels determining in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The combined SMK's and SS kernels determined in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (3) Multiply the result determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section by 0.955. The result is the total of the AO kernels of the 
respective type that shall be exported or crushed by such handler.
    (e) Substitution prohibited. Disposition credit shall not be 
granted:
    (1) To the obligation to export or crush SS kernels and SMK for any 
amount of AO kernels that may have been exported or crushed in excess of 
the quantity required in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) To the obligation to export or crush AO kernels for any amount 
of SS kernels and SMK's that may have been exported or crushed in excess 
of the quantity required in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) To the obligation to export or crush peanuts of a type, for a 
surplus amount of contract additional peanuts exported or crushed from 
another type.
    (f) Peanuts diverted. Contract additional peanuts or peanut products 
made from contract additional peanuts diverted to any country other than 
eligible country shall not be credited in the handler's favor against 
the handler's obligation to crush or export such peanuts.

[56 FR 16230, Apr. 19, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 38330, Aug. 13, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1446.602  Disposition credit for peanuts under nonphysical supervision.

    (a) Disposition credits. Contract additional peanuts of the same 
crop year and of like type shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
provisions of this part. Disposition shall be by domestic crushing or by 
export to an eligible country. Disposition credit shall, subject to the 
provisions of this part, be granted for:
    (1) Kernels that are crushed domestically under physical supervision 
of the marketing association representative; or
    (2) Kernels that are exported for crushing, if fragmented before 
being exported; or
    (3) Exported kernels that meet PAC outgoing quality standards for 
domestic edible use; or
    (4) Peanuts that are exported as farmers stock peanuts, provided 
that such peanuts meet PAC incoming quality standards for Segregation 1 
peanuts and are positive lot identified; or

[[Page 599]]

    (5) Peanuts that are exported to an eligible country as peanut 
products if such products are produced domestically in accordance with 
provisions of this part; or
    (6) Peanuts that are exported as milled or in-shell peanuts if they 
meet PAC outgoing quality standards for domestic edible peanuts; or
    (7) Peanuts that are exported as blanched peanuts; or
    (8) Peanuts that are determined by the marketing association as 
having been destroyed or otherwise made unsuitable for any commercial 
purpose. In such case the peanuts shall be considered as crushed.
    (b) Requesting physical supervision of crushing for disposition 
credit. Prior to the disposition date for contract additional peanuts, 
as provided in this part, a handler operating under the provisions of 
this part with respect to nonphysical supervision may request and 
arrange for the marketing association to supervise the crushing of SMK, 
SS and AO peanuts for disposition credit for the applicable kernel type 
by obtaining physical supervision of the peanuts under the following 
conditions:
    (1) Milled peanuts. A request to change to physical supervision for 
crushing milled peanuts for SMK, SS or AO credit may be made at any time 
prior to the final disposition date for additional peanuts for the 
relevant crop year. Physical supervision of milled peanuts shall be 
provided under the provisions of this part applicable to physical 
supervision of milled peanuts. The marketing association may require 
that positive identified lots be regraded before crushing.
    (2) Farmers stock peanuts. A request to change to physical 
supervision for crushing farmers stock peanuts must be made and approved 
prior to the peanuts being graded out of commingled storage. In order to 
determine the categories, by peanut type, for the kernels that are 
crushed, namely SS, SMK and AO kernels, physical supervision must begin 
at the gradeout from commingled storage and continue through the 
crushing of the peanuts as required in accordance with this part for a 
handler who chooses physical supervision for disposition of contract 
additional farmers stock peanuts.
    (c) Determining disposition credit. Disposition credit for SMK, SS 
and AO kernels crushed under physical supervision shall be determined 
for farmers stock peanuts from the applicable form FSA-1007, and for 
milled peanuts from the applicable form FV-184-9.
    (d) Application of crushing credits to disposition obligation--(1) 
Milled peanuts. Milled peanuts that are crushed under physical 
supervision for disposition credit may receive credit as follows:
    (i) If such peanuts meet PAC outgoing quality standards for domestic 
edible peanuts, disposition credit may apply pound-for-pound toward 
meeting the respective SMK, SS, or AO kernel obligations for the 
respective like peanut type and for like kernel type.
    (ii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC outgoing quality standards for 
domestic edible use due to aflatoxin contamination, disposition credit 
may apply to the SMK, SS or AO kernel obligations for the respective 
like peanut type and for like kernel type; except that, the percentage 
of such peanuts to which such credit will be allowed for each peanut 
type and kernel type shall not exceed the percentage of the total 
quantity of the respective type of peanuts that was purchased by the 
handler for the marketing year as contract additional peanuts.
    (iii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC outgoing quality standards 
for reasons other than aflatoxin contamination, disposition credit must 
be applied exclusively as AO kernels.
    (2) Farmers stock peanuts. Farmers stock peanuts that are crushed 
under physical supervision for disposition credit may receive credit as 
follows:
    (i) If such peanuts meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts, disposition credit may apply pound-for-pound 
toward meeting the respective SMK, SS, or AO kernel obligations for the 
respective like peanut type and for like kernel type.
    (ii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts, disposition credit may apply to the SMK, SS or AO 
kernel obligations for the respective like peanut type and for like 
kernel type; except that, the percentage of such peanuts to which such 
credit will be allowed for each peanut type and kernel

[[Page 600]]

type shall not exceed the percentage of the total quantity of the 
respective type of peanuts that was purchased by the handler for the 
marketing year as contract additional peanuts.
    (iii) If such peanuts do not meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts for any reason other than the presence of A. 
flavus mold, disposition credit must be applied exclusively as AO 
kernels.
    (3) Adjusting export credit for average dollar value of farmers 
stock peanuts. If CCC determines that the average dollar value of edible 
farmers stock peanuts graded out of commingled storage and crushed for 
export credit under the provisions of this section is less than the 
average dollar value of all like type peanuts purchased by the handler 
as contract additional peanuts, the amount of export credit for each 
kernel type determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be 
adjusted by multiplying each quantity for each kernel type by a factor 
to be determined by dividing:
    (i) The average dollar value per ton of peanuts graded out of the 
handler's commingled storage, accounted for as set forth in this part, 
and crushed for export credit under the provisions of this section; by
    (ii) The average dollar value per ton of all peanuts purchased by 
the handler as contract additional peanuts.
    (e) Blanching exception. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
part, a handler may receive credit for the pre-blanching weight of SS 
and SMK peanuts that are blanched for export if both the blanching and 
the crushing of the residue are conducted under supervision of agents of 
CCC or the marketing association. The maximum credit that may be 
received shall be:
    (1) The quantity of SMK and SS kernels as shown on the FV-184-9 that 
is submitted for proof of export for such blanched peanuts;
    (2) The quantity of the residue that is crushed under physical 
supervision; and
    (3) The pre-blanched or ``redskin'' weight less the quantities in 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, to the extent of such amount 
that the marketing association determines is reasonable and comparable 
with standard industry practices.
    (f) Export credits. In order to receive export credit toward meeting 
a handler's obligation to crush or export additional peanuts such 
exported peanuts must meet the outgoing quality standard established for 
the domestic market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146. Export credit 
will be granted in accordance with this paragraph for any exported 
peanuts that meet such quality standards.
    (1) Credit for exporting SMK peanuts. Credit for exporting SMK's of 
the same crop year, of like type, may be earned for:
    (i) The total pounds in a lot of exported peanuts which meet or 
exceed U.S. Standard grade for U.S. No. 1; or
    (ii) The total pounds, excluding splits as determined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii) of this section, in a lot of peanuts which meet PAC standards 
for:
    (A) Whole kernel peanuts with splits, or
    (B) No. 2 Virginia peanuts; or
    (iii) The total pounds determined to be SMK's in a lot of exported 
in-shell peanuts which meet U.S. Standard grade for cleaned Virginia 
type peanuts in the shell.
    (2) Credit for exporting SS kernels. Credits for SS kernels of the 
same crop year, of like type, may be earned for:
    (i) The total pounds in a lot of exported peanuts which meet the 
U.S. Standard grade for splits; or
    (ii) The total pounds, excluding SMK's as determined in paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii) of this section, in a lot of peanuts which meets PAC 
standards for:
    (A) Whole kernel with splits, or
    (B) No. 2 Virginia; or
    (iii) The total pounds determined to be SS kernels in a lot of 
exported in-shell peanuts which meet U.S. Standard grade for cleaned 
Virginia type peanuts in the shell.
    (3) Export credits for contract additional peanuts processed into 
products for export. To receive disposition credit for contract 
additional peanuts used in products for export, the shelled peanuts must 
be identified with positive lot identity tags before being moved for 
processing in accordance with provisions of this part. The peanuts shall 
be processed under supervision of the

[[Page 601]]

marketing association unless the processing handler selects to process 
such peanuts under nonphysical supervision.
    (4) Export credits for in-shell peanuts. With respect to peanuts 
exported in-shell, in accordance with instructions issued by CCC, 
credits may be earned for SMK, SS or AO kernels on the respective 
portions of the TKC of the lot that are SMK, SS or AO kernels.

               Subpart G--Penalties and Liquidated Damages


<R05>
Sec. 1446.701  Excess marketing of quota peanuts.

    A handler will be subject to a penalty for noncompliance with this 
part, if, as determined under this part, from any crop of peanuts, such 
handler markets, for domestic edible use, a larger quantity, or higher 
grade or quality of peanuts, than could reasonably be produced from the 
quantity of peanuts having the grade, kernel content, and quality of 
farmers stock peanuts purchased by the handler during the applicable 
marketing year as quota peanuts, including those peanuts purchased in 
accordance with the ``immediate buyback'' provisions of this part. In 
such case, the penalty will be an amount equal to 140 percent of the 
national average quota support rate for the applicable crop, times that 
quantity of farmers stock peanuts which are determined by CCC to be 
necessary to produce the excess quantity or grade or quality of peanuts 
marketed.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.702  Peanuts ineligible for quota loan.

    Any person who causes or permits peanuts that are not eligible 
peanuts to be pledged as collateral for a loan at the quota loan rate 
shall be considered to have agreed that:
    (a) CCC may incur serious and substantial damage to its program to 
support the price of quota peanuts because such peanuts were pledged as 
collateral for a quota loan;
    (b) The amount of such damages will be difficult, if not impossible, 
to ascertain exactly; and
    (c) Such person shall, with respect to any ineligible peanuts placed 
under quota loan, pay to CCC, as liquidated damages and in addition to 
any penalty that is due, the difference between the quota loan rate for 
such peanuts and the additional loan rate that would apply to peanuts of 
the same type and quality, times the amount of such peanuts that were 
placed under loan. It is agreed that such liquidated damages are a 
reasonable estimate of the probable actual damages which CCC would 
suffer. Such person shall pay the damages to CCC promptly upon demand in 
addition to penalties as may be due or assessed. Liquidated damages 
under this section may be reduced by CCC based upon consideration of the 
following factors:
    (1) Whether the person causing or permitting ineligible peanuts to 
be placed in the loan program made a good faith effort to ensure that 
ineligible peanuts were not pledged as loan collateral;
    (2) The degree of damage or potential damage to the price support 
program caused by the violation;
    (3) The nature and circumstances of the violation;
    (4) The extent of the violation; and
    (5) Any other pertinent information.

Sec. 1446.703  Assessment of penalties against handlers.

    (a) Penalty liability. A handler shall be subject to the penalty for 
a violation of any provision of this part including, but not limited to, 
any or all of the following violations:
    (1) Failure to register as a handler of peanuts;
    (2) Failure to examine and make entries on marketing card;
    (3) Failure to keep or make available records as required by this 
part;
    (4) Marketing excess quota peanuts, as set forth in this part, 
including any marketing of reentered contract additional peanuts or 
peanut products made from contract additional peanuts or any marketing 
of imported peanut products made from additional peanuts purchased from 
the inventory of CCC loan collateral peanuts;
    (5) Failure to store and account for contract additional peanuts in 
accordance with the requirements of this part;
    (6) Failure to export or dispose of contract additional peanuts in 
accordance with the requirements of this part or failure to export or 
crush such peanuts by the final disposition date as established in this 
part;
    (7) Failure to obtain supervision of, or to handle properly, 
contract additional peanuts in the manner required by this part;
    (8) Reentering or importing contract additional peanuts or products 
made from such peanuts as prohibited by this part; or

[[Page 603]]

    (9) Failure to comply with any other provision of this part.
    (b) Amount of penalty. Except when reduced in accordance with this 
part, the penalty amount for any violation of this part shall be equal

(including a full reduction of the entire penalty) after taking into 
account the severity of the violation and the violation history of the 
handler.

section has not been satisfied and the remaining criteria has been 
satisfied, the penalty shall not be reduced to less than an amount which

    (a) Calculating producer's share of peanuts produced or considered 
produced on a farm. The amount of peanuts produced or considered

producer's eligibility for payments at the quota rate and at the 
additional rate will be computed separately. A producer, within the 
quantity limit determined under paragraph (a) of this section, may claim 
payments at the quota payment rate to the extent that it is determined 
that the producer used a quota to market the peanuts or was prevented 
from doing so because of conditions beyond the producer's control. The 
producer's eligibility shall, otherwise, be only at the additional 
peanut payment rate.
    (c) Calculating producer's total assistance payment--(1) Assistance 
payment for quota peanuts. A producer's assistance payment for quota 
peanuts is the product of the assistance rate for quota peanuts set 
forth in Sec. 1447.106(a) times the sum of the amount of quota pounds 
eligible for payment for each farm as determined under paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section.
    (2) Assistance payment for additional peanuts. A producer's 
assistance payment for additional peanuts is the product of the 
assistance rate for additional peanuts set forth in Sec. 1447.106(b) 
times the sum of the amount of additional pounds eligible for payment 
for each farm as determined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1447.110  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) A person may be denied payments under this part if it is

purpose of a program operated under this part;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation with respect to such program; 
or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

in connection with this part, all payments made in regard to such matter 
shall be refunded to CCC, together with interest as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and late-payment charges 
as provided for in part 1403 of this chapter.
    (c) Producers shall be required to pay interest on any refund 
required of the producer receiving assistance or a payment if CCC 
determines that payments or other assistance were provided to the 
producer and the producer was not eligible for such assistance. The 
interest rate shall be 1 percent greater than the rate of interest that 
the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date of 
payment. Interest that

[[Page 610]]

is determined to be due CCC shall accrue from the date such benefits 
were made available by CCC to the date repayment is completed. CCC may 
waive the accrual of interest if CCC determines that the cause of the

                     Subpart A--Tobacco Loan Program

    Source: 45 FR 9253, Feb. 12, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.1  Administration.

    (a) This program will be administered by the Tobacco and Peanuts 
Division, FSA, under the general direction and supervision of the 
Executive Vice President, CCC. The program will be carried out by 
cooperative marketing associations (hereinafter referred to as 
``associations'') acting on behalf of their producer members. To obtain 
a price support loan, an association must enter into a loan agreement 
with CCC. The loan agreement will set forth terms and conditions for 
making price support available to producers. To the extent provided in 
the loan agreement, an association shall meet the eligibility 
requirements for price support prescribed in the Cooperative Marketing 
Associations Eligibility Requirements for Price Support (part 1425 of 
this chapter), as amended. CCC reserves the right to restrict the number 
of associations with which it will contract. In so doing, CCC will 
select such associations as it deems necessary or desirable to 
effectuate the purposes of the program with a maximum of efficiency and 
economy of operations. The names of such associations may be obtained 
from the Tobacco and Peanuts Division, FSA, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013.
    (b) Each year CCC will make loans to associations. The associations 
in turn will make price support advances available to eligible producers 
either directly or through auction warehouses. The tobacco on which 
producers receive price support advances will serve as security for the 
loans. Loans made to associations will include not only the initial loan 
value of the tobacco, but also amounts to cover costs of receiving, 
processing, storing, and selling the loan tobacco, including that part 
of overhead costs not borne by the association pursuant to Sec. 1464.4. 
Associations will be authorized to enter into contracts for these 
services through the usual trade channels. Loans also may include 
amounts to cover any Federal and State income taxes which the 
associations are required by the Internal Revenue Service or State 
governmental body to pay on income received from the sale of loan 
tobacco.

[45 FR 9253, Feb. 12, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 51555, Nov. 16, 1982; 48 
FR 21110, May 11, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.2  Availability of price support.

    (a) Kind of tobacco. Price support will be available to eligible 
producers on the following kinds of eligible tobacco subject to 
conditions listed in Secs. 1464.7 and 1464.8 respectively.

Flue-cured tobacco, types 11, 12, 13, and 14.
Kentucky-Tennessee Fire-cured tobacco, types 22 and 23.

[[Page 612]]

Virginia Fire-cured tobacco, type 21.
Virginia Sun-cured tobacco, type 37.
Dark Air-Cured tobacco, types 35 and 36.
Burley tobacco, type 31.
Cigar filler and binder tobacco, types 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, and 55.

    (b) Method of providing price support--(1) Through auction 
warehouses. (i) Price support will be available for each lot of eligible 
tobacco offered for sale at auction warehouses which have contracted 
with an association, on a form of agreement approved by CCC, to make 
price support advances to producers on behalf of the association. 
Producers will deliver their tobacco to auction warehouses which will 
display the tobacco and offer it for sale at auction. Each contract 
between an association and an auction warehouse will require the auction 
warehouse to see that producers are informed that price support advances 
are available for each lot of eligible tobacco offered for sale at 
auction when the final bid is less than the price support rate available 
for the grade of eligible tobacco comprising such lot. For Flue-cured 
and Burley tobacco, the associations' contracts with auction warehouses 
will also require the auction warehouses to mark any tobacco sale bill 
``No Price Support'' if the marketing of the pounds of tobacco covered 
by such bill will result in the producer marketing in excess of 103 
percent of the producer's effective farm marketing quota. Producers will 
receive price support advances from the warehouse operator for any 
tobacco to be consigned by the warehouse operator to the association. 
Price support advances will be paid to the producer at the time the 
warehouse operator settles with the producer for the entire quantity of 
the producer's tobacco that has been displayed for inspection and 
offered for sale on any one day's auction market. The warehouse operator 
will be reimbursed by the association with funds borrowed from CCC.
    (ii) Price support will be available only at warehouses where 
tobacco inspection service is provided by the Agricultural Marketing 
Service, USDA. Inspection and price support services may be extended to 
new markets or to additional sales on established markets in accordance 
with this part and Subpart A of part 29 of this title which provides for 
formal public hearings prior to extending of additional services.
    (iii) CCC reserves the right to direct the association to withhold a 
contract under the price support program from any auction warehouse for 
one or more years if, based on previous performance of similar 
contracts, or other evidence, there is substantial reason to believe 
that such warehouse will not fulfill its contract obligations.
    (2) Special requirements for flue-cured and burley tobacco. Price 
support will be available only on flue-cured and burley tobacco that has 
been designated for sale at specific warehouses by the producer under 
the following conditions:
    (i) Definition. Producer as used in this paragraph means the person 
who was issued the tobacco marketing card pursuant to part 723 of this 
title.
    (ii) Producer designation of warehouses. Producers will be required, 
as a condition of price support, to designate the warehouses at which 
they will market their tobacco.
    (A) For flue-cured tobacco such designations may be at any warehouse 
or warehouses in any market within a radius of 100 miles from the county 
seat of the county in which the farm is located, or if such farm is 
physically within two counties, then from the county seat of the county 
in which the county FSA office administering that farm is located. To 
the extent there are less than eight markets within such radius, any 
warehouse or warehouses in any of the eight markets nearest to the 
county seat may be designated. A producer may obtain price support only 
in a warehouse which the producer has designated, and at each such 
warehouse only with respect to the quantity of tobacco designated for 
sale at such warehouse.
    (B) For burley tobacco such designations may be at any warehouse or 
warehouses in any burley market.
    (iii) When producer designations shall be made. Producers must 
designate the warehouse(s) at which they will market their tobacco 
during a period that shall be announced beforehand by the local county 
FSA office. Unless extended by the Deputy Administrator, the period for 
making designations shall be before May 31 each year for

[[Page 613]]

flue-cured tobacco and August 31 each year for burley tobacco. Producers 
who lease quota or whose farm is reconstituted (the combining or 
dividing of a farm due to a change in operation) after such period may 
designate the warehouse(s) at which their tobacco will be marketed 
according to procedures to be established by the Deputy Administrator, 
Farm Programs, FSA. Producers who have designated warehouses that cease 
to operate or cease to have tobacco inspection or price support 
available may change their designations at any time after such 
occurrences. Producers who have designated warehouses whose inspection 
services have been temporarily suspended for any reason for the 
equivalent of at least one sales day may change their designation at any 
time after such occurrences. Redesignation (changes in warehouse(s) 
designated or in pounds designated to a warehouse) or designations for 
farms that have not previously designated tobacco may be made by 
producers during the five business days ending on the first Friday of 
each month during the flue-cured or burley, as applicable, tobacco 
marketing season. Such redesignation or initial designation shall be 
made on any one day of each redesignation period. Such redesignation or 
initial designation shall be effective on the second Monday following 
the Friday on which the redesignation period ends.
    (iv) Form and content of designations. For flue-cured tobacco a 
designation shall be made for each warehouse at which a producer desires 
to market tobacco by executing a form provided by the county FSA office. 
The producer will be required to indicate on such form the name of the 
warehouse or warehouses designated by the producer and the pounds of 
flue-cured tobacco the producer desires to sell at such warehouse as 
well as any other information required to be stated on such form. For 
burley tobacco a designation shall be made for each warehouse, receiving 
station or dealer at which a producer desires to market tobacco by 
executing a form provided by the county FSA office. The producer will be 
required to indicate on such form the name of the warehouse(s), 
receiving station(s) or dealer(s) designated by the producer and the 
pounds of burley tobacco the producer desires to sell at such warehouse, 
receiving station or dealer as well as any other information required to 
be stated on such form.
    (v) Entering designation information. For flue-cured tobacco, the 
warehouse code number of the warehouse the producer has designated will 
be indicated on the farm marketing card. For burley tobacco, the 
warehouse, receiving station, or dealer code number of the warehouse, 
receiving station or dealer the producer has designated will be 
indicated on the farm marketing card. If an effective date is determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, such effective 
date will be shown on the farm marketing card. For flue-cured tobacco, 
if the producer has not designated a warehouse, a warehouse code will 
not be shown on the marketing card. Changes in designation by the 
producer shall be accomplished by the producer returning the marketing 
card to the county FSA office and requesting the transfer of any 
unmarketed pounds of flue-cured or burley tobacco shown on any marketing 
card to another eligible warehouse, receiving station or dealer, if 
applicable.
    (vi) Use of warehouse designation information. (A) A separate sale 
bill marked ``no price support'' shall be prepared for that quantity of 
tobacco weighted in that is in excess of the balance of the pounds 
designated as shown on the marketing card:
    (B) The warehouse shall mark ``no price support'' on a sale bill for 
any tobacco which is presented for sale and which is accompanied by a 
marketing card which does not show a warehouse code, which shows a code 
of another warehouse, or which shows an effective date which is later 
than the date on which the tobacco is presented for sale.
    (vii) Availability of designation information. Each county FSA 
office shall send designations received to the Flue-Cured Tobacco 
Cooperative Stabilization Corporation, Raleigh, North Carolina for flue-
cured tobacco, Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, 
Lexington, Kentucky and Burley Stabilization Corporation, Knoxville, 
Tennessee for burley tobacco, following

[[Page 614]]

each designation period and each period for changing designations. That 
association(s) shall inform the Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee or 
the Burley Tobacco Advisory Committee, as applicable, of the pounds 
designated to each warehouse and the pounds of any undesignated or non-
auction tobacco that, for the purpose of recommending opening dates and 
selling schedules in accordance with part 29 of this title, is available 
for apportioning for sale at each warehouse. That association also shall 
furnish each warehouse the name and address of the producers who 
designated the warehouse, the pounds each designated and the pounds that 
represent 103 percent of the marketing quota of each such producer. The 
Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division, shall furnish each receiving 
station the name and address of the producers who designated the 
receiving station, the pounds each designated and the pounds that 
represent 103 percent of the marketing quota of each such producer.
    (viii) Failure to comply with opening date and selling schedule by 
warehouses. Warehousemen shall comply with opening date and selling 
schedule requirements as provided in 7 CFR 29.9406.
    (3) Upon direct delivery to the Association. Eligible producers in 
nonauction market areas may deliver eligible tobacco to central 
receiving points designated by the appropriate association.
    (4) Period of price support. Price support will be available to 
eligible producers on eligible tobacco only during each year's normal 
marketing season for each kind of tobacco for which support is provided.
    (5) Beginning with the 1981 crop, eligible producers may obtain 
price support on untied burley tobacco packed in bales subject to the 
following conditions:
    (i) The quality and condition of the tobacco contained in each bale 
delivered for price support as a single lot will be representative of 
the quality and condition of the tobacco contained in all other such 
bales of the same lot.
    (ii) The tobacco in each bale will be stalk-cured.
    (iii) The bales will not contain foreign matter or conceal inferior 
tobacco.
    (iv) Specification of bales:
    (A) Bales must be approximately 1x2x3 feet in size.
    (B) The leaves in bales must be untied and oriented.
    (C) The basket ticket shall show the number of bales in the lot. 
Each bale in the lot shall be identified by a uniform identification tag 
1\5/8\ inches wide by 3\1/4\ inches long which shall be attached 
securely to the bale and shall show at least the following information: 
(1) Warehouse registration number, (2) basket ticket identification 
number, and (3) bale number.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.3  Level of price support.

    (a) The level of price support for eligible tobacco shall be 
determined in accordance with section 106 of the Agricultural Act of 
1949, as amended.
    (b) Flue-Cured tobacco of varieties Coker 139, Coker 140, Coker 316, 
Reams 64, Reams 266, and Dixie Bright 244, or a mixture or strain of 
such seed varieties or any breeding line of Flue-Cured tobacco seed 
varieties, including, but not limited to, 187 Golden Wilt (also 
designated by such names as No-Name, XYZ), having the quality and 
chemical characteristics of the seed varieties designated as Coker 139, 
Coker 140, Coker 316, Reams 64, Reams 266, or Dixie Bright 244 will be 
supported at one-half the support rate, plus 50 cents per hundred 
pounds, for comparable grades of acceptable varieties.

[51 FR 32426, Sept. 12, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.4  Deductions from advances.

    (a) There may be deducted from price support advances paid to 
tobacco producers amounts to help defray administrative overhead costs 
incurred by producers associations through which price support is made 
available to tobacco producers.
    (b) If any producer on a farm is indebted to the United States and 
such indebtedness is listed on the Claim Control Record, Form ASCS-604, 
the Government will effect collection of

[[Page 615]]

the amount of the indebtedness by setoff from the amount of price 
support advance due the producer in the following manner: Any marketing 
card covering tobacco eligible for price support issued for such farm in 
accordance with the applicable regulations issued by the Secretary of 
Agriculture with respect to marketing quotas (parts 723 of this title) 
will bear a notation showing the indebtedness, the name of the debtor 
and the amount of the indebtedness. The acceptance and use of a 
marketing card bearing a notation of indebtedness to the United States 
by a producer named as debtor on such card will constitute an 
authorization by such producer to any tobacco warehouse operator or 
association to pay the United States the price support advance due the 
producer to the extent of their indebtedness set forth on such card but 
not to exceed that portion of the price support advance remaining after 
deduction of usual warehouse and authorized price support charges and 
amounts due prior lienholders. The acceptance and use of a marketing 
card bearing a notation and information of indebtedness to the United 
States will not constitute a waiver of any right of the producer to 
contest the validity of such indebtedness by appropriate administrative 
appeal or legal action.

[45 FR 9253, Feb. 12, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 28608, July 1, 1982; 56 
FR 21259, May 8, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.5  Interest rate and general provisions.

    The loans made to the associations will bear interest at the rate 
announced by CCC and will be nonrecourse both as to principal and 
interest except in the case of misrepresentation, fraud or failure to 
carry out the loan agreement. Tobacco loses its identity as to original 
ownership through commingling in the packing process, and individual 
producers may not redeem their tobacco once it has been pledged as 
security for the loan. Associations will sell the loan tobacco as 
provided in the loan agreements for each crop, and the net proceeds of 
sales of the loan collateral of each crop will be applied to the loan 
account for such crop until the loan is repaid in full. With respect to 
the 1981 and prior crops, if the proceeds from the sale of loan 
collateral of the 1981 or any prior crop exceed (a) the amount of the 
loan plus all fees, handling charges, operating costs and interest; and 
(b) any amount due CCC under a barter transfer agreement entered into 
between CCC and the association, such excess shall constitute ``net 
gains'' and shall be distributed in cash by the association to the 
producers who placed the tobacco under loan unless other disposition is 
approved by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.6  Maturity date.

    Loans made under the program will mature on demand.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.7  Eligible producer.

    To qualify as an eligible producer for purposes of receiving price 
support during the current marketing year a person must have eligible 
tobacco, as provided in Sec. 1464.8, for marketing and such person:
    (a) Must have agreed to make contributions to a No Net Cost Fund or 
pay assessments to a No Net Cost Account, as applicable, in accordance 
with Sec. 1464.10.
    (b) Must not have been found, after notice and opportunity for an 
administrative hearing in accordance with part 780 of this title, to 
have:
    (1) Knowingly delivered nested tobacco for the purpose of receiving 
price support.
    (2) Filed a false report with respect to the use of pesticides on 
tobacco produced for marketing during the current marketing year.
    (3) Erroneously represented any fact affecting a tobacco program 
determination.
    (4) Adopted any scheme or device which tends to defeat the purpose 
of the tobacco program.
    (5) Made any fraudulent representations with respect to the tobacco 
program.
    (c) Must be in compliance with the provisions of part 12 of this 
title.
    (d) In addition to meeting all other requirements that apply 
elsewhere, including (but not limited to) the warehouse designation 
provisions of Sec. 1464.2,

[[Page 616]]

must not be ineligible, in accordance with part 1400 of this title, to 
receive price support payments, loans and benefits.
    (e) With respect to any tobacco which is presented for price 
support, must have retained beneficial interest in the tobacco prior to 
presenting the tobacco for such loan.
    (1) For purposes of this section, the producer will be considered to 
have retained beneficial interest in the tobacco only if such producer 
has complete control of and title to such tobacco, including the right 
to tender such tobacco to CCC for a price support loan on the date such 
tobacco is tendered to CCC for a price support loan, and has maintained 
this right and that interest in the tobacco at all times prior to 
presenting the tobacco for the loan.
    (2) If a producer receives a monetary advance or other consideration 
in connection with or for such tobacco, the producer will be deemed for 
purposes of this section to have lost beneficial interest in such 
tobacco unless the producer has a written agreement with the person who 
provides the advance payment or consideration and such agreement 
accurately and fully:
    (i) Sets forth the amount, nature and date of the advance or 
consideration;
    (ii) Sets forth the poundage on which the advance or consideration 
was made;
    (iii) Provides that the tobacco will be sold at a producer auction 
through an auction warehouse at which price support is provided, or will 
be presented for a price support loan;
    (iv) Provides that as a full and final settlement on the tobacco, 
the full sales price at the producer auction or the full loan proceeds 
will be paid to the producer minus only the following:
    (A) Any advance set out in the agreement; and
    (B) Standard published assessments or charges for services rendered 
at standard published rates that apply to all tobacco of all producers, 
including tobacco for which no advance has been paid;
    (v) Sets forth the date of final settlement to be made on the 
tobacco which date can be no later than the date applicable to tobacco 
on which no advance has been made.
    (vi) States that the full profit and beneficial interest in the 
tobacco, and full control of the tobacco, remains with the producer and 
provides that the full profit and beneficial interest will remain with 
the producer at all times prior to any disposition of the tobacco as 
producer tobacco, or at a producer auction, or presenting for a price 
support loan.
    (3) A producer will be considered to have lost beneficial interest 
in tobacco and thereby not be an ``eligible producer'' for such tobacco 
as of the date any advance or other preauction arrangement was made if 
CCC determines for that tobacco that:
    (i) The advance per pound equalled or exceeded the producer's final 
net proceeds per pound on all tobacco marketed from the farm for that 
marketing year at producer auctions, including any tobacco on which an 
advance is made or the pledging of tobacco for price support loans;
    (ii) A written agreement was required by paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, but none has been executed; or
    (iii) A written agreement was executed but did not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) If tobacco is pledged for a price support loan and the producer 
is not then or thereafter deemed to be or to have been an eligible 
producer for that tobacco for purposes of placing the tobacco under such 
loan, then the tobacco shall be considered to have a loan value of zero. 
The producer and the person that took possession of the tobacco from the 
producer, or paid an advance, or marketed the tobacco, or disposed of 
the tobacco as producer tobacco, shall be jointly and severally liable 
with the producer for returning any loan proceeds previously paid in the 
name of, or for the account of, the producer. Further, the disposition 
of any tobacco as producer tobacco where the producer is not then or 
thereafter considered to have been an eligible producer with respect to 
such tobacco may be the subject of penalties on the grounds of false 
identification, excess marketings, or otherwise as provided in part 723 
of this title. These remedies

are in addition to any others as may apply.
    (f) Must be in compliance with the provisions of parts 400 and 402

    (a) Is not a kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are not in 
effect for the marketing year because marketing quotas have been 
disapproved in a referendum of producers;
    (b) Is offered for marketing by the person who was the producer of 
the tobacco, or in the case of a deceased producer, by the duly 
authorized successor(s) in interest;
    (c) Is offered for marketing in accordance with Sec. 1464.2(b);
    (d) If marketing quotas are in effect for the kind of tobacco:
    (1) The farm operator has filed a report of the acreage planted to 
tobacco on the farm in the applicable year in accordance with part 718 
of this title.
    (2) The tobacco was produced on a farm on which neither the reported 
nor determined acreage of the kind of tobacco exceeds any acreage 
allotment established for the farm in accordance with the applicable 
part 723 of this title for the kind of tobacco for the applicable year.
    (3) Is identified when delivered to the association either directly 
or through an auction warehouse with a single marketing card for each 
lot of tobacco.
    (e) If marketing quotas are in effect for the kind of tobacco or if 
marketing quotas are not in effect but would have been in effect for the 
kind of tobacco had such marketing quotas not been terminated by the 
Secretary, the operator of the farm on which the tobacco was produced:
    (1) Has certified that all tobacco delivered from such farm for 
price support will not have not been nested as defined in part 29 of 
this title.
    (2) Has certified to the county ASC committee on a form approved by 
the Deputy Administrator that all pesticides (including plant 
regulators, defoliants, and desiccants), as defined in 40 CFR 162.3, 
which were used in connection with the production of the tobacco have 
been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for use on tobacco 
and any such pesticides that were used were applied in accordance with 
label directions.
    (3) Has not refused to permit the sampling of such tobacco, either 
on the farm or where stored, for chemical analysis for the purpose of 
verifying the accuracy of any pesticide certification.
    (f) With respect to burley and flue-cured tobacco only, is a 
quantity of tobacco which when added to the pounds of the respective 
kind of tobacco previously marketed from the farm during the marketing 
year does not exceed 103 percent of the effective farm marketing quota 
established for the respective kind of tobacco for that year.
    (g) With respect to flue-cured tobacco only, is a quantity of 
tobacco which was delivered to the association through an auction 
warehouse and is a quantity which when added to the pounds of flue-cured 
tobacco previously marketed from the farm at that warehouse does not 
exceed the quantity of flue-cured tobacco designated by the farm 
operator for marketing at that warehouse.
    (h) Any tobacco with respect to which the producer is not an 
eligible producer under the provisions of Sec. 1464.7 shall not be 
eligible for a price support loan and in any case in which the producer 
is deemed to have ceased to have retained the status of an eligible 
producer due to an advance or other preauction arrangement, the 
producer's marketing card shall not be used to market such tobacco 
except to reflect a nonauction marketing to the

[[Page 618]]

person who paid an advance to the producer or took possession of the 
tobacco from the producer.

part 780 of this title, that such producer:
    (a) Received a price support advance on tobacco that was nested, as 
defined in part 29 of this title or otherwise not eligible for price

Representative, may reduce the refund with respect to tobacco otherwise 
required in this part, in accordance with guidelines issued by the 
Deputy Administrator.

which tends to defeat the purpose of the tobacco program. The refund of 
CCC price support advance shall apply to all payments on all farms 
received by such producer.

    (7) Quota tobacco means any kind of tobacco for which marketing 
quotas are in effect or for which marketing quotas are not disapproved

    (5) All persons who are responsible for collecting any contribution 
or assessment required by this section shall remit such collections to 
the applicable association within 15 days of the date on which the 
tobacco was marketed except as provided in paragraphs (i)(5) (i) and

rate equal to 75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the 
nearest whole cent) for the kind of tobacco for the immediately 
preceding year on the quantity of tobacco as to which failure occurs. 
Such a penalty only shall be assessed after the person has been notified 
of the pending assessment of the penalty and the person has been 
afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the assessment of 
the penalty. However, such marketing penalty shall not be assessed if 
such contributions or assessment are collected and remitted not later 
than 15 days after the date required by this part.
    (2) If a warehouse operator fails to collect and remit any 
contribution or assessment to an association within 15 days after the 
date provided in the loan contract between the warehouse operator and 
such association, the association shall provide to the State ASC 
committee for the state in which the warehouse operator's business is 
located a statement of the reason for the failure of the person to 
timely remit such collection, including the name and address of the 
warehouse involved, the pounds of tobacco purchased, the date of 
purchase, and the date the collection was required to be remitted. The 
association shall submit such facts within 25 days after the applicable 
due date regardless of whether such assessment or contribution has been 
remitted to the association.
    (3) The State ASC committee shall be responsible for assessing any 
marketing penalty determined in accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section.
    (4) The Deputy Administrator or the Deputy Administrator's designee

to, and not exclusive of, any other remedies that may be available with 
respect to collection and remission of any contributions or assessments

to timely remit the BDMA, such importer shall be subject to a marketing 
penalty at a per kilogram rate equal to 75 percent of the average market 
price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the respective like 
kind domestic tobacco being imported for the domestic marketing year 
which immediately preceded the domestic marketing year in which the 
imported tobacco became subject to the BDMA. Such marketing penalty rate 
shall apply to the quantity of tobacco on which the failure occurred. 
Amounts due for the penalty shall be in addition to any other amount as 
may be due, including, but not limited to, the amount due for the BDMA 
itself, or any applicable late fees, charges, or interest.
    (2) Importer no-net-cost assessment. With respect to assessments 
referred to in Sec. 1464.103, if an importer of burley or flue-cured 
tobacco fails to timely remit a no-net-cost assessment in accordance 
with the provisions in this subpart, such importer shall be liable, in 
addition to any no-net-cost assessment or other sum due and any late 
payment charges, to a marketing penalty at a per kilogram rate equal to 
75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole 
cent) for the respective kind of domestic tobacco (burley or flue-cured) 
for the respective domestic tobacco marketing year in which such 
imported tobacco was imported, on the quantity of tobacco as to which 
the failure occurs.
    (b) Exception to marketing penalty. A marketing penalty otherwise 
required by this paragraph may be forgiven if the assessment for which 
nonpayment of the penalty could be assessed is remitted not later than 
15 calendar days after the date otherwise required for the remittance by 
this subpart.
    (c) Notification of marketing penalty. Before a marketing penalty is 
assessed, the importer shall be notified of the pending assessment and 
shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the 
assessment of the penalty. Such notification will be by, and such 
hearing will be before, the Director or designee.
    (d) Marketing penalty reduction. The Executive Vice President, CCC, 
or designee, may reduce the amount of any marketing penalty for which a 
person otherwise would be liable under the provisions of this section 
upon finding that failure to comply was unintentional or without 
knowledge on the part of such person and that such reduction would not 
damage the tobacco program or the administration of this part.
    (e) Prohibition of use, processing or marketing of tobacco for which 
the assessments have not been paid; other remedies.

[[Page 626]]

The knowing use, processing, or marketing of tobacco in the commerce of 
the United States of any tobacco for which an assessment or related

all records that are relevant to any imported tobacco that is subject to 
an assessment in accordance with this subpart. Such records shall be 
retained for a period of three years following the date of entry of such 
tobacco. The burden of establishing compliance with this part shall be 
on the importer of the tobacco.
    (b) Examination of records and reports. The Executive Vice 
President, CCC, the Director, or any person authorized by one of such 
persons, or any auditor or agent of the Office of the Inspector General, 
is authorized to examine any records that such person has reason to 
believe are relevant to any matter pertinent to the payment of importer 
assessments under this subpart. Upon request of an authorized person, 
each importer shall make available for examination such records as are 
under such importer's control that may be relevant to imported tobacco 
that is subject to an assessment in accordance with this subpart or 
otherwise relevant to the administration of this subpart. Upon a failure 
to provide access or records, the Director may presume that such an 
inquiry would have produced information unfavorable to the party to the 
inquiry and shall make further determinations in the matter accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.108  Reconsideration and appeal.

    An importer may request the Director to reconsider any determination 
of the amount of any assessment due, any marketing penalty assessed, or

the date of the notification of such assessment, marketing penalty, or 
adverse determination. If the importer is dissatisfied with a 
determination rendered by the Director with respect to a request for 
reconsideration, such importer may appeal the determination to the 
Director, National Appeals Division, FSA. Any such appeal shall be 
handled in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 780.

Growers Settlement Trust, the State shall, to the extent practicable, 
distribute funds made available under this part (that is, under the 
TLAP) to eligible persons in the State in accordance with the formulas 
established pursuant to the Trust to the extent provided for in the

National Tobacco Growers Settlement Trust, the State shall distribute 
funds made available under TLAP to eligible persons in the State in a 
manner determined by the State and approved by the Executive Vice 
President, CCC. The National Tobacco Growers Settlement Trust referred 
to in this section is that private trust created by tobacco companies to 
make approximately $5 billion in payments available to parties involved 
in the production of tobacco, and which has distributed the monies 
through local, state trusts.

President will determine the allocation of funds available for 
apportionment to qualifying States.

State or may, at the direction of the State, be transferred to a 
disbursing or other agent of the State's choice.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.203  Eligibility.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the State's 
receipt of funds or control of funds under this part shall be 
conditioned upon the promise, obligation and understanding that the 
funds will be distributed to eligible tobacco growers as that term is 
defined in this section, in accord with the provision of this part.
    (b) For a person to be considered an eligible ``tobacco grower'' for 
purposes of this part, such person must own or operate, or produce 
tobacco on a farm:
    (1) To which was assigned a poundage quota or acreage allotment for 
the 1999 crop year for an eligible kind of tobacco; and
    (2) That was used for the production of tobacco during the 1998 or 
1999 crop year.
    (c) All disputes as to eligibility shall be the responsibility of 
the States and any terms in the authorizing statute that are contrary to 
the terms of this part shall be controlling.
    (d) Any interest earned by the States on sums distributed in this 
part shall be distributed in turn to eligible tobacco growers.
    (e) Of the sums made available to the States under this part, and 
interest earned on such sums, an amount may be deducted by the State for 
such reasonable amounts as may be needed to pay the cost of distributing 
the funds, including the cost of private agents who may be engaged to 
assist the State in that respect or provide service to the State in that 
respect.

is in error should seek relief from the State government. Eligibility 
decisions and determinations made by the State government are not 
appealable to the Department of Agriculture under part 780 of this 
chapter and will not be considered to be determinations of the 
Department of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.205  Alternate distribution.

    Nothing in Secs. 1464.201 through 1464.204 shall prohibit the 
Executive Vice President from providing assistance to the States with 
respect to the distribution of the monies to eligible tobacco growers or 
prevent the Executive Vice President from making distributions directly 
to the eligible growers in lieu of the manner of distribution otherwise 
provided for in this part.

subsequent losses. Certifications of third parties or the producer and 
other such documentation as the county committee determines to be 
necessary in order to verify the information provided by the producer 
may be requested and be subject to review by the county committee. 
Failure to provide documentation that is satisfactory to the county 
committee will result in disapproval of the application by the county 
committee.
    (c) In all circumstances, tobacco producers shall certify the 
accuracy of the information provided.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.307  Benefits.

    The payment amount shall be determined by apportioning the available

interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.
    (b) A producer who is determined to have knowingly:

supervision of the Executive Vice President of the CCC and the Deputy 
Administrator for Farm Programs of the Farm Service Agency (FSA) of the 
Department of Agriculture (who shall be hereafter referred to in this 
part as the ``Deputy Administrator''). The program shall be carried out 
in the field by State and county FSA committees (State and county 
committees).
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and employees 
thereof, do not have the authority to modify or waive any of the 
provisions of the regulations in this part.
    (c) The State committee shall take any action required by this part 
that has not been taken by the county committee. The State committee 
shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with this part; 
or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No delegations in this part to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, from 
determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or 
modifying any determination made by a State or county committee. The 
Deputy Administrator may modify or revise deadlines and requirements 
contained in this subpart as determined needed or appropriate to 
accomplish the goals of this program.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.403  Eligibility.

    For a person to be considered an ``eligible person'' for purposes of 
this part, such person must own, operate or produce eligible tobacco on 
a farm for which a quota reduction from the 1999 crop year to the 2000 
crop year occurred and that was used for the production of tobacco 
during the 2000 crop year. Leased quotas may, as determined appropriate 
by the Deputy Administrator in making the payments prior to January 1, 
2001, may qualify operators or controllers and growers by reference by 
back, as needed, to the leasing farm. Also, to the extent allowed by 
Pub. L. 106-387 payments may be made to person without regard to whether 
the quota was used for the production of eligible tobacco during the 
2000 crop year. Payments that are made by virtue of the preceding 
sentence may by made, to the extent authorized by law, from funds of the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and without regard to the overall 
limitation for payment that otherwise apply to this program.

[66 FR 53509, Oct. 23, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.404  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section shall be applicable for 
all purposes of administering the program (``TLAP00'') of this subpart. 
The definitions in 7 CFR 718.2 and 723.104 also apply to the program. To 
the extent that the definitions in this section differ from the 
definitions in 7 CFR 718.2 and 723.104, the definitions in this section 
apply rather than the definitions in 7 CFR 718.2 and 723.104. The 
following terms shall have the following meanings:
    Controller means that person or entity who, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator, controls the land used to produce eligible tobacco 
and share in the risk of production.
    Eligible person means, with respect to payments under this part and 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 1464.403 and other provisions of this 
part, a person who owns or operates, or produces eligible tobacco on a 
farm for which the quantity of quota of eligible tobacco allotted to the 
farm under part I of subtitle B of title III of the Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938 was reduced from the 1999 crop year to the 2000 
crop year. Actual production of the crop may be required to the extent 
otherwise provided in these rules. For purposes of

[[Page 632]]

this subpart, further, an eligible person's status, as owner or 
controller or producer of the tobacco, will be determined as of July 3, 
2000.
    Eligible tobacco means each of the following kinds of tobacco: flue-
cured tobacco (types 11, 12, 13 and 14), dark fire-cured tobacco (type 
21), burley tobacco (type 31), and cigar-binder tobacco (types 54 and 
55).
    Grower/tenant means person(s) or entities who provide labor to 
produce tobacco and share in the risk of production.
    Payment pounds means the pounds of tobacco for which a person is 
eligible to be paid under this subpart.
    Producer means person(s) or entity(s) actively engaged in planting, 
growing, harvesting, and/or marketing of tobacco, or who shares in the 
risk of producing the crop.
    Quota owner means the person(s) or entities who own the land for 
which quota is established under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, as amended.
    Share in the risk of production means having a direct financial 
stake in the success of the crop through a direct share in the actual 
proceeds from the actual marketing of the crop which share is 
conditional upon the success of that marketing. Farm owners who cash-
lease their farm land to a tobacco producer for the right to grow 
tobacco on that land and receive payment for such right regardless of 
whether or not a tobacco crop is marketed are not considered to share in 
the risk of production. Farm laborers who provide service in exchange 
for a wage and whose payment is not subject to the marketing of the 
tobacco crop are not considered to be sharing in the risk of production.
    TLAP00 means the Tobacco Loss Adjustment Program, for the 2000 crop, 
which is provided for in this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.405  Sign up.

    (a) Eligible persons who wish to apply for TLAP00 funds, must file 
an application with the county FSA office by the date established by the 
Deputy Administrator. However, a late filed application filed late 
because of hardship may be accepted. Acceptance of such applications 
must be approved by the Deputy Administrator, subject to the 
availability of funds.
    (b) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine 
eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; 
however, without it program benefits will not be provided.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.406  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.407  Payment benefits.

    (a) TLAP00 payments shall be made to ``eligible persons'' not later 
than October 20, 2000 on the basis of two formulas.
    (1) All flue-cured and cigar-binder funds in a State will distribute 
50 percent to eligible quota owners and 50 percent to eligible 
producers.
    (2) All burley and dark fire-cured tobacco funds in a State will be 
distributed one-third to quota owners; one-third to the controller; and 
one-third to grower(s)/tenant(s).
    (b) As provided in paragraph (a) of this section the formulas shall 
be applied to the kinds of tobacco as follows:
    (1) The allocated funds for cigar-binder (types 54 and 55) will be 
disbursed with 50 percent being paid to quota owners based on basic 
allotment times NASS yield and 50 percent being paid to producers based 
on basic allotment times the NASS yield. The NASS yield for cigar-binder 
(types 54 and 55) is 2,054 pounds per acre.
    (2) The allocated funds for dark fire-cured (type 21) will be 
disbursed with one-third being paid to quota owners based on the 2000 
crop year basic allotment times NASS yield, one-third being paid to the 
controller based on the 2000 crop year effective allotment times NASS 
yield, and one-third being paid to grower(s)/tenant(s) based on the 2000 
crop year effective quota times NASS yield. The NASS yield for dark 
fire-cured (type 21) is 2,139 pounds per acre.
    (3) The allotted funds for flue-cured tobacco (types 11, 12, 13 and 
14) will be disbursed with 50 percent paid to quota owners on the 2000 
crop year basic quota and 50 percent being paid to producers on the 2000 
crop year basic quota.

[[Page 633]]

    (4) The allotted funds for burley tobacco (type 31) will be 
disbursed with one-third being paid to quota owners based on the 2000 
crop year basic quota; one-third being paid to the farm controller based 
on the 2000 crop year effective quota before any disaster lease and 
transfer pounds; and one-third being paid to grower(s)/tenant(s) based 
on the 2000 crop year effective quota before any disaster lease and 
transfer pounds.
    (c) The Secretary shall use the amount allocated to the State of 
Georgia to make payments to eligible persons in the State of Georgia 
only if the State of Georgia agrees to use an equal amount (not to 
exceed $13,000,000) to make payments at the same time, or subsequently, 
to the same eligible persons in the same manner as provided for in this 
section.
    (d) The payment amount shall be determined by apportioning the 
allocated funds for each State on a poundage basis among the timely 
applications that are filed, with an allowance for a reserve to handle 
hardships and appeals.
    (e) All payments under this part are subject to the eligibility of 
funds; further, terms used in this part may be further refined and 
applied as will more closely align the payments made under this subpart 
with payments made under the various State programs which have preceded 
it. In the case where a payment to a farm is disputed the Deputy 
Administrator may require that all interested parties agree to the 
resolution of the dispute before any payment is made and may delay 
payments to the farm until any such disputes are resolved. Also, as 
determined appropriate to accomplish the desire that program payments be 
made expeditiously in a manner that is administratively efficient, the 
Deputy Administrator may properly exclude payments to a person who does 
not file a timely claim and all payments may be made to those parties 
whose claim to the payment is not challenged. Nothing in this section 
shall, however, be construed to prevent the agency from denying any 
payment to any person based upon a failure of that person to meet any 
eligibility criteria set forth in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.408  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof to any person shall be made without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor, except that the regulations governing offsets and 
withholdings found at 7 CFR part 1403 shall be applicable to payments 
made under this part and such offsets and withholdings may be taken 
against such payments.
    (b) Any producer entitled to any payment may assign the right to 
receive such payments, in whole or in part, as provided in 7 CFR part 
1404.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.409  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A producer who is determined to have erroneously represented any 
fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this part 
shall not be entitled to payments and must refund all payments, plus 
interest determined in accordance with 7 CFR part 1403.
    (b) A producer who is determined to have knowingly:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination shall 
refund to CCC all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with 
7 CFR part 1403, received by such producer with respect to all 
applications. The producer's interest in all applications shall be 
terminated.


<R05>

    (a) Program documents executed by persons legally authorized to 
represent estates or trusts will be accepted only if such persons 
furnish evidence of the authority to execute such documents.
    (b) A minor who is a producer shall be eligible for assistance under 
this subpart only if such person meets one of the following 
requirements:
    (1) The right of majority has been conferred on the minor by court 
proceedings or by statute;
    (2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property and 
has executed the applicable program documents; or
    (3) A bond is furnished under which the surety guarantees any loss 
incurred for which the minor would be liable had the minor been an 
adult.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.413  Death, incompetence, or disappearance.

    In the case of death, incompetence, or disappearance of any person 
who is eligible to receive assistance in accordance with this part, such 
person or persons as are specified in 7 CFR part 707 may receive such 
assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.414  Appeals.

    Appeals of determinations made under this part shall be heard under 
the provisions appearing in 7 CFR parts 11 and 780. Provisions of 
general applicability are not appealable and likewise matters committed 
to agency discretion may not be appealable. Nothing in this section 
shall be taken to expand the scope of review of any determination or 
make a determination appealable that would otherwise not be appealable.

State, and local levels in order to ensure that producers whose land has 
environmental problems and natural resource concerns are aware, 
informed, and know that they may be eligible to apply for program 
assistance. Special outreach will be made to eligible producers with 
historically low participation rates, including but not restricted to 
limited resource producers, small-scale producers, Indian tribes, Alaska 
natives, and Pacific Islanders.
    (h) NRCS State conservationists shall develop an education plan that 
describes the educational assistance that will be provided to enhance 
program participant's knowledge about conservation opportunities, will 
aid in implementing their conservation plan, and enhance environmental 
benefits that will be realized through implementation of the program. In 
the development of the education plan, NRCS will design a coordinated 
approach, including national, State, and local components depending on 
the similar or unique education needs identified. NRCS will encourage 
cooperation among education providers, such as the Extension system, 
conservation districts, State agencies, and other public and private 
education providers, as well as the use of existing educational 
resources, material, or programs that deal with natural resource related 
issues.
    (i) The Chief, with FSA concurrence, will make funding decisions for 
national conservation priority areas, State-approved priority areas, and 
significant statewide natural resource concerns outside a funded 
priority area.
    (1) After review of funding requests, the Chief may base funding 
decisions on an allocation process which considers:
    (i) The significance of the environmental and natural resources 
conditions;
    (ii) Factors used and considered in accordance with paragraphs (d) 
and (f) of this section;

[[Page 646]]

    (iii) The need to maximize environmental benefits per dollar 
expended;
    (iv) The capability of the partners involved in the proposal to 
provide flexible technical, educational, and financial assistance;
    (v) The conservation needs of farmers and ranchers in complying with 
the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions of part 12 
of this title and Federal, State, and tribal environmental laws;
    (vi) The opportunity for encouraging environmental enhancement;
    (vii) The anticipated or proven performance of the partners involved 
in the proposal in delivering the program; and
    (viii) Other relevant information to meet the purposes of the 
program as found in this part.
    (2) In evaluating the considerations described in paragraph (i)(1) 
of this section, the Chief may consult other Federal agencies with the 
appropriate expertise and information.
    (3) The approval of a priority area at the State level does not 
necessarily mean that funds will be allocated to that area. Funding may 
be allocated to a priority area for one or more years. Proposals that 
are not funded may be resubmitted to the Chief for subsequent review and 
consideration to determine if the resubmitted proposal meets Federal 
priorities for funding.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.6  Conservation plan.

    (a) The participant shall develop and submit a conservation plan for 
the farm or ranch unit of concern that, when implemented, protects the 
soil, water, or related natural resources in a manner that meets the 
purpose of the program, is acceptable to NRCS, and is approved by the 
conservation district. This plan forms the basis for an EQIP contract.
    (1) When considering the acceptability of the plan, NRCS will 
consider whether the participant will use the most cost-effective 
conservation practices to solve the natural resource concerns and 
maximize environmental benefits per dollar expended.
    (2) As determined by NRCS, the conservation plan must allow the 
participant to achieve a cost-effective resource management system, or 
some appropriate portion of that system, identified in the applicable 
NRCS field office technical guide, for the priority natural resource 
condition of concern in the priority area or the significant statewide 
natural resource concern outside a funded priority area.
    (b) Upon a participant's request, the NRCS may provide technical 
assistance to a participant. NRCS may utilize the services of qualified 
personnel of cooperating Federal, State, or local agencies, Indian 
tribes, or private agribusiness sector or organizations, in performing 
its responsibilities for technical assistance. Participants may use the 
services of qualified non-NRCS professionals to provide technical 
assistance. NRCS retains approval authority over the technical adequacy 
of work done by non-NRCS personnel for the purpose of determining EQIP 
contract compliance.
    (c) Participants are responsible for implementing the conservation 
plan. A participant may seek additional assistance from other public or 
private organizations or private agribusiness sector as long as the 
activities funded are in compliance with this part.
    (d) All conservation practices scheduled in the conservation plan 
are to be carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS field 
office technical guide.
    (e) The conservation plan, or supporting documentation, for the farm 
or ranch unit of concern shall include:
    (1) A description of the prevailing farm or ranch enterprises and 
operations that may be relevant to conserving and enhancing soil, water, 
or related natural resources;
    (2) A description of relevant natural resources, including soil 
types and characteristics, rangeland types and conditions, proximity to 
water bodies, wildlife habitat, or other relevant characteristics 
related to the conservation and environmental objectives of the plan;
    (3) A description of the participant's specific conservation and 
environmental objectives to be achieved;
    (4) To the extent practicable, the quantitative or qualitative goals 
for achieving the participant's conservation and environmental 
objectives;

[[Page 647]]

    (5) A description of one or more conservation practices in the 
conservation management system to be implemented to achieve the 
conservation and environmental objectives;
    (6) A description of the schedule for implementing the conservation 
practices, including timing and sequence; and
    (7) Information that will enable evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the plan in achieving the conservation and environmental objectives.
    (f) To simplify the conservation planning process for the 
participant, the conservation plan may be developed, at the request of 
the participant, as a single plan that incorporates, to the extent 
possible, any or all other Federal, State, tribal, or local government 
program or regulatory requirements. Participants do not need to replace 
existing plans developed by natural resource professionals if such plans 
meet the resource management objectives under this part. NRCS may accept 
an existing conservation plan developed and required for participation 
in any other USDA program if the conservation plan otherwise meets the 
requirements of this part. When a participant develops a single 
conservation plan for more than one program, the participant shall 
clearly identify the portions of the plan that are applicable to the 
EQIP contract. It is the responsibility of the participant to ascertain 
and comply with any and all applicable program or regulatory 
requirements, and the NRCS development or approval of a conservation 
plan shall not be deemed to constitute compliance with program or 
regulatory requirements administered or enforced by another agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.7  Conservation practices.

    (a)(1) The NRCS, with FSA consultation, shall provide guidance for 
determining structural, vegetative, and land management practices 
eligible for program payments. To be considered as an eligible 
conservation practice, the practices must provide beneficial, cost-
effective approaches for participants to change or adapt operations to 
conserve or improve soil, water, or related natural resources or to 
provide for environmental enhancement.
    (2) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee or local work group, shall determine the 
conservation practices eligible for program payments for the priority 
area or for significant statewide natural resource concerns outside a 
priority area.
    (3) Where new technologies or conservation practices that provide a 
high potential for maximizing the environmental benefits per dollar 
expended have been developed, NRCS may approve interim conservation 
practice standards and financial assistance for pilot work to evaluate 
and assess the performance, efficacy, and effectiveness of the 
technology or conservation practices at maximizing environmental 
benefits per dollars expended. NRCS may involve other entities in the 
pilot testing, including conservation districts, extension and research 
agencies and institutions, private agribusiness sector, and others.
    (b)(1) CCC cannot provide cost-share assistance to construct an 
animal waste management facility on a large confined livestock 
operation. CCC may fund other structural, vegetative, or land management 
practices needed in the conservation management system to address the 
livestock-related natural resource concerns on a large confined 
livestock operation. Except as provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, CCC will consider a producer with confined livestock operations 
of more than 1,000 animal unit equivalents to be a large confined 
livestock operation and ineligible for financial assistance for 
construction of an animal waste management facility. When determining 
the number of livestock in the participant's operation for eligibility 
purposes, the total number of animals confined at all locations of the 
participant's livestock operation will be used.
    (2) The NRCS State conservationist may develop a definition for a 
large confined livestock operation as it applies to that particular 
State using criteria recommended by the State technical committee. The 
criteria will consider but not be limited to such factors as:

[[Page 648]]

    (i) The cost-effectiveness of the facility and its potential to 
maximize environmental benefits per dollar expended;
    (ii) The ability of the producer to pay for the cost of animal waste 
management facilities;
    (iii) The significance of the natural resource concern resulting 
from the operation;
    (iv) The prevailing State, Tribe, or local implementation of various 
Federal, Tribal, and State environmental laws and regulations, including 
regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
et seq.) and guidance developed under Sec. 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act 
Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 1455b);
    (v) The particular characteristics of modern livestock operations; 
and
    (vi) The size of the operation in relation to other confined 
livestock operations in the State or region.
    (3) The NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee, shall place emphasis on the considerations 
contained in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section when 
developing the criteria to define a large confined livestock operation.
    (4) The definitions developed by NRCS State conservationists must be 
approved by the Chief, who will also provide oversight on their 
implementation. In approving the definitions the Chief will consider:
    (i) The justification for the definition; and
    (ii) The need for consistency in the definitions used between and 
among States, to the greatest extent possible.
    (5) The Chief will report semiannually to the Secretary during the 
first two years of the program on the implementation of paragraph (b) of 
this section, including the impact that may have occurred to the 
environment and to the structure of livestock agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.8  Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel not affiliated with USDA.

    (a) A NRCS State conservationist may utilize technical and other 
assistance from qualified personnel of other Federal, State, and local 
agencies, or Indian tribes, and will encourage producers to use the most 
cost-effective technical assistance available, including if appropriate, 
using the services of the private agribusiness sector to carry out the 
assigned responsibilities of the program.
    (b) Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel 
not affiliated with USDA may include, but is not limited to: 
conservation planning; conservation practice survey, layout, design, 
installation, and certification; information, education, and training 
for producers; and training, certification, and quality assurance for 
professional conservationists.
    (c) NRCS shall provide technical coordination and leadership for the 
program, regardless of who provides technical and other assistance, and 
shall assure that the quality of the assistance obtained from other 
Federal, State, and local agencies, Indian tribes, and the private 
agribusiness sector is acceptable for purposes of this part. Non-NRCS 
assistance shall not be deemed to satisfy an EQIP contract entered into 
under subpart B of this part until the assistance has been approved by 
NRCS.


<R04>
                          Subpart B--Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 1466.20  Application for contracts and selecting offers from producers.

    (a) Any producer who has eligible land may submit an application for 
participation in the EQIP to a USDA service center. Producers who are 
members of a joint operation shall file a single application for the 
joint operation.
    (b) CCC will accept applications throughout the year. NRCS shall 
rank and select the offers of applicants periodically, as determined 
appropriate by NRCS after consultation with the State technical 
committee and on the recommendation of the local work groups.
    (c) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the local 
work group, will develop ranking criteria to prioritize applications 
within a priority area. NRCS shall prioritize applications from the same 
EQIP-funded priority area using the criteria specific

[[Page 649]]

to the area. The FSA county committee, with the assistance of the 
designated conservationist and the FSA county executive director, shall 
approve for funding the applications in a priority area based on 
eligibility factors of the applicant and the NRCS ranking.
    (d) The NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee, and using quality criteria in the NRCS field office 
technical guide, will develop criteria to prioritize applications from 
applicants with significant statewide natural resource concerns outside 
a priority area. The FSA county committee, with assistance of the 
designated conservationist and FSA county executive director, shall 
approve for funding these applications based on the eligibility factors 
of the applicant and the NRCS ranking.
    (e) The designated conservationist will work with the applicant to 
collect the information necessary to evaluate the application using the 
ranking criteria. A participant has the option of offering and accepting 
less than the maximum program payments allowed.
    (f) NRCS will rank all applications using criteria that will 
consider:
    (1) The environmental benefits per dollar expended;
    (2) A reasonable estimate of the cost of the conservation practices, 
the program payments that will be paid to the applicant, and other 
factors for determining which applications will present the least cost 
to the program;
    (3) The environmental benefits that will be derived by applying the 
conservation practices in the conservation plan which will meet the 
purposes of the program;
    (4) The extent to which the contract will assist the applicant in 
complying with Federal, State, tribal, or local environmental laws;
    (5) Whether the land in the application is located in a priority 
area and the extent to which the contract will assist the priority area 
goals and objectives.
    (g) If two or more applications have an equal rank, the application 
that will result in the least cost to the program will be given greater 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.21  Contract requirements.

    (a) In order for a participant to receive cost-share or incentive 
payments, the participant shall enter into a contract agreeing to 
implement a conservation plan or portions thereof. FSA shall determine 
the eligibility of participants. The FSA county committee, with NRCS 
concurrence, shall use the NRCS ranking consistent with the provisions 
of Sec. 1466.20 and grant final approval of a contract.
    (b) An EQIP contract shall:
    (1) Incorporate by reference all portions of a conservation plan 
applicable to EQIP;
    (2) Be for a duration of not less than 5 years nor more than 10 
years;
    (3) Incorporate all provisions as required by law or statute, 
including participant requirements to:
    (i) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch unit of concern 
that would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract;
    (ii) Refund any program payments received with interest, and forfeit 
any future payments under the program, on the violation of a term or 
condition of the contract, consistent with the provisions of 
Sec. 1466.25;
    (iii) Refund all program payments received on the transfer of the 
right and interest of the producer in land subject to the contract, 
unless the transferee of the right and interest agrees to assume all 
obligations of the contract, consistent with the provisions of 
Sec. 1466.24; and
    (iv) Supply information as required by CCC to determine compliance 
with the contract and requirements of the program.
    (4) Specify the participant's requirements for operation and 
maintenance of the applied conservation practices consistent with the 
provisions of Sec. 1466.22; and
    (5) Any other provision determined necessary or appropriate by CCC.
    (c) The participant must apply a financially assisted practice 
within the first 12 months of signing a contract.
    (d) There is a limit of one EQIP contract at any one time for each 
tract of agricultural land, as identified with a FSA tract number, 
determined at the

[[Page 650]]

time of the application for EQIP assistance. Subject to the payment 
limitation set out elsewhere in this part, a participant may have 
subsequent EQIP contracts for different natural resource needs or 
concerns following completion of a previous EQIP contract on the same 
tract.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.22  Conservation practice operation and maintenance.

    The contract shall incorporate the operation and maintenance of 
conservation practices applied under the contract. The participant shall 
operate and maintain the conservation practice for its intended purpose 
for the life span of the conservation practice, as identified in the 
contract or conservation plan, as determined by CCC. Conservation 
practices installed before the execution of a contract, but needed in 
the contract to obtain the environmental benefits agreed upon, are to be 
operated and maintained as specified in the contract. NRCS may 
periodically inspect the conservation practice during the life span of 
the practice as specified in the contract to ensure that operation and 
maintenance is occurring.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.23  Cost-share and incentive payments.

    (a)(1) The maximum direct Federal share of cost-share payments to a 
participant shall not be more than 75 percent of the projected cost of a 
structural or vegetative practice. The direct Federal share of cost-
share payments to a participant shall be reduced proportionately below 
75 percent, or the cost-share limit as set in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, to the extent that total financial contributions for a 
structural or vegetative practice from all public and private entity 
sources exceed 100 percent of the projected cost of the practice.
    (2) CCC shall provide incentive payments to participants for a land 
management practice in an amount and at a rate necessary to encourage a 
participant to perform the land management practice that would not 
otherwise be initiated without government assistance.
    (3) CCC shall set the cost-share and incentive payment limits, as 
determined by:
    (i) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the local 
work group and State technical committee, for a priority area; or
    (ii) The NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee, for participants subject to environmental 
requirements or with significant statewide natural resource concerns 
outside a funded priority area.
    (4) Cost-share payments and incentive payments may both be included 
in a contract.
    (5) Cost-share and incentive payments will not be made to a 
participant who has applied or initiated the application of a 
conservation practice prior to approval of the contract.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the total 
amount of cost-share and incentive payments paid to a person under this 
part may not exceed:
    (1) $10,000 for any fiscal year; and
    (2) $50,000 for any multi-year contract.
    (c) To determine eligibility for payments, CCC shall use the 
provisions in 7 CFR part 1400 related to the definition of person and 
the limitation of payments, except that:
    (1) States, political subdivisions, and entities thereof will not be 
persons eligible for payment.
    (2) For purposes of applying the payment limitations provided for in 
this section, the provisions in part 1400, subpart C for determining 
whether persons are actively engaged in farming, subpart E for limiting 
payments to certain cash rent tenants, and subpart F as the provisions 
apply to determining whether foreign persons are eligible for payment, 
will not apply.
    (3)(i) The NRCS State conservationist may authorize, on a case-by-
case basis, payments in excess of $10,000 in any fiscal year, up to the 
$50,000 limitation in paragraph (b) of this section. However, such 
increase in payments for a certain year shall be offset by reductions in 
the payments in subsequent years. A decision to approve payments in 
excess of the annual limit will consider whether:

[[Page 651]]

    (A) The practices in the system need to be applied at once so that 
the system is fully functioning to resolve the natural resource problem;
    (B) The natural resource problem is so severe that resolving the 
problem immediately is needed;
    (C) The producer needs to complete the practices in one year so that 
the farming operation is not interrupted or disturbed by the practice 
installation over a 5-10 year period; or
    (D) The producer can install the practices at a lower total cost 
when installed in one year, thereby reducing the program payments.
    (ii) With respect to land under EQIP contract which is inherited in 
the second or subsequent years of the contract, the $10,000 fiscal year 
limitation shall not apply to the extent that the payments from any 
contracts on the inherited land cause an heir, who was party to an EQIP 
contract on other lands prior to the inheritance, to exceed the annual 
limit.
    (iii) With regard to contracts on tribal land, Indian trust land, or 
BIA allotted land, payments exceeding one limitation may be made to the 
tribal venture if an official of the BIA or tribal official certifies in 
writing that no one person directly or indirectly will receive more than 
the limitation.
    (4) Any cooperative association of producers that markets 
commodities for producers shall not be considered to be a person 
eligible for payment.
    (5) The status of an individual or entity on the date of application 
shall be the basis on which the determination of the number of persons 
involved in the farming operation is made.
    (6) A participant shall not be eligible for cost-share or incentive 
payments for conservation practices on eligible land if the participant 
receives cost-share payments or other benefits for the same land under 
the Conservation Reserve Program (16 U.S.C. 3831-3836) or the Wetlands 
Reserve Program (16 U.S.C. 3837 et seq.).
    (d) The participant and NRCS must certify that a conservation 
practice is completed in accordance with the contract before the CCC 
will approve the payment of any cost-share or incentive payments.
    (e) CCC expenditures under a contract entered into during a fiscal 
year shall not be made until the subsequent fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.24  Contract modifications and transfers of land.

    (a) The participant and CCC may modify a contract if the participant 
and CCC agree to the contract modification and the conservation plan is 
revised in accordance with NRCS requirements and is approved by the 
conservation district.
    (b) The parties may agree to transfer a contract with the agreement 
of all parties to the contract. The transferee must be determined by CCC 
to be eligible and shall assume full responsibility under the contract, 
including operation and maintenance of those conservation practices 
already installed and to be installed as a condition of the contract.
    (c) CCC may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any 
assistance earned under EQIP if the participant sells or loses control 
of the land under an EQIP contract and the new owner or controller is 
not eligible to participate in the program or refuses to assume 
responsibility under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.25  Contract violations and termination.

    (a)(1) If CCC determines that a participant is in violation of the 
terms of a contract or documents incorporated by reference into the 
contract, CCC shall give the participant a reasonable time, as 
determined by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS, to 
correct the violation and comply with the terms of the contract and 
attachments thereto. If a participant continues in violation, the FSA 
county committee may, in consultation with NRCS, terminate the EQIP 
contract.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a contract termination shall be effective immediately upon a 
determination by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS, 
that the participant has submitted false information or filed a false 
claim, or engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for 
payments is permitted under the provisions of Sec. 1466.35, or in a case 
in

[[Page 652]]

which the actions of the party involved are deemed to be sufficiently 
purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.
    (b)(1) If CCC terminates a contract, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for future payments under the contract and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received, plus interest determined in accordance 
with part 1403 of this chapter. The FSA county committee, in 
consultation with NRCS, has the option of requiring only partial refund 
of the payments received if a previously installed conservation practice 
can function independently, are not affected by the violation or other 
conservation practices that would have been installed under the 
contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain the 
installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.
    (2) If CCC terminates a contract due to breach of contract or the 
participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual 
payments have been made, the participant shall forfeit all rights for 
further payments under the contract and shall pay such liquidated 
damages as are prescribed in the contract. The FSA county committee, in 
consultation with NRCS, will have the option to waive the liquidated 
damages depending upon the circumstances of the case.
    (3) When making all contract termination decisions, CCC may reduce 
the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which 
reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the 
contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have 
prevented compliance with the contract.
    (4) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract if CCC 
agrees based on CCC's determination that termination is in the public 
interest.
    (5) In carrying out its role in this section, NRCS may consult with 
the local conservation district.

operating unit or tract for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of 
any representations made in a contract or in anticipation of entering a 
contract, as to the performance of the terms and conditions of the 
contract. Access shall include the right to provide technical assistance 
and inspect any work undertaken under the contract. The CCC 
representative shall make a reasonable effort to contact the participant 
prior to the exercise of this provision.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.33  Performance based upon advice or action of representatives of CCC.

    If a participant relied upon the advice or action of any authorized 
representative of CCC, and did not know or have reason to know that the 
action or advice was improper or erroneous, the FSA county committee, in 
consultation with NRCS, may accept the

[[Page 653]]

advice or action as meeting the requirements of the program and may 
grant relief, to the extent it is deemed desirable by CCC, to provide a 
fair and equitable treatment because of the good-faith reliance on the 
part of the participant.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.34  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof to any person shall be made without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found at part 1403 of this chapter 
shall be applicable to contract payments.
    (b) Any producer entitled to any payment may assign any payments in 
accordance with regulations governing assignment of payment found at 
part 1404 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.35  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A producer who is determined to have erroneously represented any 
fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this part 
shall not be entitled to contract payments and must refund to CCC all 
payments, plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of this 
chapter.
    (b) A producer who is determined to have knowingly:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination, shall 
refund to CCC all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with 
part 1403 of this chapter, received by such producer with respect to all 
contracts. The producer's interest in all contracts shall be terminated.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.4  Program requirements.

    (a) General. Under the WRP, the Department may purchase conservation 
easements from, or enter into restoration cost-share agreements with, 
eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate in the restoration and 
protection of wetlands and associated lands. To participate in WRP, a 
landowner will agree to the implementation of a Wetlands Reserve Plan of 
Operations (WRPO), the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, 
maintain, and manage the hydrologic conditions of inundation or 
saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of 
eligible lands. The Department may provide cost-share assistance for the 
activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management of wetland functions and values. Specific 
restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management 
actions may be undertaken by the landowner or other Department designee.
    (b) Acreage limitations. (1) Except for areas devoted to windbreaks 
or shelterbelts after November 28, 1990, no more than 25 percent of the 
total cropland in any county, as determined by the Farm Service Agency, 
may be enrolled in the CRP and the WRP, and no more than 10 percent of 
the total cropland in the county may be subject to an easement acquired 
under the CRP and the WRP.
    (2) The Department and the Farm Service Agency shall concur before a 
waiver of either the 25 percent limit or the 10 percent limit of this 
subsection can be approved for an easement proposed for enrollment in 
the WRP. Such a waiver will only be approved if it will not adversely 
affect the local economy, and operators in the county are having 
difficulties complying with the conservation plans implemented under 16 
U.S.C. 3812.
    (c) Landowner eligibility. The Department may determine that a 
person is not eligible to participate in the WRP or receive any WRP 
payment because the person did not comply with the provisions of 7 CFR 
part 12. To be eligible to enroll an easement in the WRP, a person must:
    (1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is 
sought;
    (2) Have been the landowner of such land for the 12 months prior to 
the time the intention to participate is declared unless it is 
determined by the State Conservationist that the land was acquired by 
will or success as a result of the death of the previous landowner, the 
ownership change occurred due to foreclosure on the land and the owner 
of the land immediately before the foreclosure exercises a right of 
redemption from the mortgage holder in accordance with State law, or 
that adequate assurances have been presented to the State 
Conservationist that the new landowner of such land did not acquire such 
land for the purpose of placing it in the WRP; and
    (3) Agree to provide such information to the Department as the 
agency deems necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of 
eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation 
purposes.
    (d) Eligible land. (1) The Department shall determine whether land 
is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands 
may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful 
restoration of

[[Page 657]]

wetland functions and values when considering the cost of acquiring the 
easement and restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and 
management costs.
    (2) Land shall only be considered eligible for enrollment in the WRP 
if the Department determines, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, that:
    (i) Such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and 
functions;
    (ii) The likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and 
the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the 
program, taking into consideration the cost of such restoration; and
    (iii) Such land meets the criteria of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) The following land may be eligible for enrollment in the WRP, 
which land may be identified by the Department pursuant to regulations 
and implementing policies pertaining to wetland conservation found at 7 
CFR part 12, as:
    (i) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions, farmed wetlands, prior 
converted cropland, commenced conversion wetlands, farmed wetland 
pastures, and lands substantially altered by flooding so as to develop 
wetland functions and values;
    (ii) Former or degraded wetlands that occur on lands that have been 
used or are currently being used for the production of food and fiber, 
including rangeland and forest production lands, where the hydrology has 
been significantly degraded or modified and will be substantially 
restored;
    (iii) Riparian areas along streams or other waterways that link or, 
after restoring the riparian area, will link wetlands which are 
protected by an easement or other device or circumstance that achieves 
the same objectives as an easement:
    (iv) Land adjacent to the restored wetland which would contribute 
significantly to wetland functions and values including buffer areas, 
wetland creations, and non-cropped natural wetlands, but not more than 
the State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical 
Committee, determines is necessary for such contribution;
    (v) Other wetlands that would not otherwise be eligible but would 
significantly add to the wetland functions and values; and
    (vi) Wetlands that have been restored under a private, State, or 
Federal restoration program with an easement or deed restriction with a 
duration of less than 30 years.
    (4) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must be configured 
in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management of 
the area for easement purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program 
objectives.
    (e) Ineligible land. The following land is not eligible for 
enrollment in the WRP:
    (1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was commended after 
December 23, 1985;
    (2) Land that contains timber stands established under a CRP 
contract or pasture land established to trees under a CRP contract.
    (3) Lands owned by an agency of the United States;
    (4) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction with a duration 
of 30 years or more prohibiting the production of agricultural 
commodities; and,
    (5) Lands where implementation of restoration practices would be 
futile due to on-site or off-site conditions.
    (f) Enrollment of CRP lands. Land subject to an existing CRP 
contract may be enrolled into the WRP only if the land and landowner 
meet the requirements of this part, and the enrollment is requested by 
the landowner and agreed to by the Department. To enroll in WRP, the CRP 
contract for the property shall be terminated or otherwise modified 
subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon by the 
Farm Service Agency and the landowner.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.5  Application procedures.

    (a) Application for participation. To apply for enrollment, a 
landowner must submit an Application for Participation in the WRP. The 
application must be submitted during an announced period for such 
submissions.

[[Page 658]]

    (b) Preliminary agency actions. By filing an Application for 
Participation, the landowner consents to a Department representative 
entering upon the land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions 
and values, and for other activities such as the development of the 
preliminary WRPO that are necessary or desirable for the Department to 
make offers of enrollment. The landowner is entitled to accompany a 
Department representative on any site visits.
    (c) Voluntary reduction in compensation. In order to enhance the 
probability of enrollment in WRP, a landowner may voluntarily offer to 
accept a lesser payment than is being offered by the Department.

42143, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.6  Establishing priority for enrollment of properties in WRP.

    (a) The Department shall place priority on the enrollment of those 
lands that will maximize wildlife values (especially related to 
enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife); have the 
least likelihood of re-conversion and loss of these wildlife values at 
the end of the WRP enrollment period; and that involve State, local, or 
other partnership matching funds and participation.
    (b) Ranking considerations. Based on applications for participation, 
the State Conservationist, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and the State Technical Committee, will rank properties 
based on: estimated costs of restoration and easement acquisition, 
availability of matching funds, significance of wetland functions and 
values, estimated success of restoration measures, and the duration of a 
proposed easement with permanent easements being given priority over 
non-permanent easements.
    (c) The Department may place higher priority on certain geographic 
regions of the State where restoration of wetlands may better achieve 
Department State and regional goals and objectives.
    (d) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, the State 
Conservationist may enroll eligible lands at any time in order to 
encompass total wetland areas subject to multiple ownership or otherwise 
to achieve program objectives. Similarly, the State Conservationist may, 
at any time, exclude otherwise eligible lands if the participation of 
the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of 
the wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling to participate.

[60 FR 28514, June 1, 1995. Redesignated and amended at 61 FR 42141, 
42142, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.7  Enrollment of easements.

    (a) Offers of enrollment. Based on the priority ranking, the 
Department will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance 
into the program for which the landowner has 15 calendar days to sign a 
letter of intent to continue. Department will select lands to maximize 
environmental benefits per expenditure of Federal funds.
    (b) Effect of letter of intent to continue (enrollment). An offer of 
tentative acceptance into the program does not bind the Department or 
the United States to acquire an easement, nor does it bind the landowner 
to convey an easement or agree to WRPO activities. However, receipt of 
an executed letter of intent to continue will authorize the Department 
to proceed.
    (c) Acceptance of offer of enrollment. A contract will be presented 
by the Department to the landowner, which will describe the easement 
area; the easement terms and conditions; and other terms and conditions 
for participation that may be required by the Department. A landowner 
accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing contract.
    (d) Effect of the acceptance of the offer. After the contract is 
executed by Department and the landowner, the Department will proceed 
with various easement acquisition activities, which may include 
conducting a survey of the easement area, securing necessary 
subordination agreements, procuring title insurance, and conducting 
other activities necessary to record the easement or implement the WRPO.
    (e) Withdrawal of offers. Prior to execution by the United States 
and the landowner of the contract, the Department may withdraw its offer 
anytime due to availability of funds, inability to clear title, or other 
reasons. The

[[Page 659]]

offer to the landowner shall be void if not executed by the landowner 
within the time specified. The date of the offer shall be the date of 
notification to the landowner of tentative acceptance.

[60 FR 28514, June 1, 1995. Redesignated and amended at 61 FR 42141, 
42142, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.8  Compensation for easements.

    (a) Establishment of rates. (1) The State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, shall determine 
easement payment rates to be applied to specific geographic areas within 
the State or to individual easement areas.
    (2) In order to provide for better uniformity among States, the 
Regional Conservationist and Chief may review and adjust, as 
appropriate, State or other geographically based easement payment rates.
    (b) Determination of easement payment rates. (1) Easement payment 
rates will be based upon analyses of the values of the lands when used 
for agricultural purposes. The landowner will receive the lesser of the 
following:
    (i) the geographic area rate;
    (ii) the value based on a market appraisal analysis/assessment; or
    (iii) the landowner offer.
    (2) Each State Conservationist will determine the easement payment 
rates using the best information which is readily available in that 
State for assessing the values of land for agricultural purposes. Such 
information may include: soil types, type(s) of crops capable of being 
grown, production history, location, real estate market values, 
appraisals and market analyses, and tax rates and assessments. The State 
Conservationist may consult with other Federal agencies, real estate 
market experts, appraisers, local tax authorities, and other entities or 
persons which may provide information on productivity and market 
conditions.
    (3) Easement payments for non-permanent easements will be less than 
those for permanent easements because the quality and duration of the 
ecological benefits derived from a non-permanent easement are 
significantly less than those derived from a permanent easement on the 
same land. Additionally, the economic value of the easement interests 
being acquired is less for a non-permanent easement than that associated 
with a permanent easement. An easement payment for the short-term 30-
year easement shall not be less than 50 percent nor more than 75 percent 
of that which would have been paid for a permanent easement.
    (c) Maximum payments. In order to ensure that limited program funds 
are expended to maximize program benefits, the State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish a maximum 
easement payment for any one easement within a State or for geographic 
areas within a State.
    (d) Preliminary estimates of easement payments. Upon request of the 
landowner prior to filing an application for enrollment, a landowner may 
be appraised of the maximum easement payment rates.
    (e) Acceptance of offered easement compensation. (1) The Department 
will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of 
the easement payment which is offered by the Department. The easement 
payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and 
rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement. By 
voluntarily participating in the program, a landowner waives any claim 
to additional compensation based on fair market value.
    (2) Annual easement payments may be made in no less than 5 annual 
payments and no more than 30 annual payments of equal or unequal size.
    (f) Reimbursement of a landowner's expenses. For completed easement 
conveyances, the Department will reimburse landowners for their fair and 
reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for surveying and related costs, 
as determined by the Department. The State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish maximum 
payments to reimburse landowners for reasonable expenses.
    (g) Tax implications of easement conveyances. Subject to applicable 
regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, a landowner may be eligible 
for a bargain sale tax deduction which is the difference between the 
fair market value of the easement conveyed to the

[[Page 660]]

United States and the easement payment made to the landowner. The 
Department disclaims any representations concerning the tax implications 
of any easement or cost-share transaction.
    (h) Payment limitation on non-permanent easements. With respect to 
non-permanent easements, the annual amount of easement payments to any 
person may not exceed $50,000 except for:
    (1) Payments made pursuant to projects involving partnership funding 
or participation; or
    (2) Payment received by a State, political subdivision, or agency 
thereof in connection with agreements entered into under a special 
wetland and environmental enhancement program carried out by that entity 
that has been approved by Department.
    (i) If easement payments are calculated on a per acre basis, 
adjustment to stated easement payment will be made based on final 
determination of acreage.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.9  Cost-share payments.

    (a) The Department may share the cost with landowners of restoring 
the enrolled land as provided in the WRPO. The amount and terms and 
conditions of the cost-share assistance shall be subject to the 
following restrictions on the costs of establishing or installing 
practices specified in the WRPO:
    (1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement, the Department 
shall offer to pay not less than 75 percent nor more than 100 percent of 
such costs; and
    (2) On enrolled land subject to a non-permanent easement or 
restoration cost-share agreement, the Department shall offer to pay not 
less than 50 percent nor more than 75 percent of such costs. Restoration 
cost-share payments offered by Department for the short-term, 30-year 
easements shall be 50 to 75 percent.
    (b) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by the 
Department that an eligible practice or an identifiable unit of the 
practice has been established in compliance with appropriate standards 
and specifications. Identified practices may be implemented by the 
landowner or other designee.
    (c) Cost-share payments may be made for the establishment and 
installation of additional eligible practices, or the maintenance or 
replacement of an eligible practice, but only if Department determines 
the practice is needed to meet the objectives of the easement, and the 
failure of the original practices was due to reasons beyond the control 
of the landowner.
    (d) A landowner may seek additional cost-share assistance from other 
public or private organizations as long as the activities funded are in 
compliance with this part. In no event shall the landowner receive an 
amount which exceeds 100 percent of the total actual cost of the 
restoration.

Sec. 1467.10  Easement participation requirements.

    (a) To enroll land in WRP, a landowner shall grant an easement to 
the United States. The easement shall require that the easement area be 
maintained in accordance with WRP goals and objectives for the duration 
of the term of the easement, including the restoration, protection, 
enhancement, maintenance, and management of wetland and other land 
functions and values.
    (b) For the duration of its term, the easement shall require, at a 
minimum, that the landowner, and the landowner's heirs, successors and 
assigns, shall cooperate in the restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management of the land in accordance with the easement 
and with the terms of the WRPO. In addition, the easement shall grant to 
the United States, through the Department:
    (1) A right of access to the easement area;
    (2) The right to permit compatible uses of the easement area, 
including such activities as hunting and fishing, managed timber 
harvest, or periodic haying or grazing, if such use is consistent with 
the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetland resources for 
which the easement was established;

[[Page 661]]

    (3) All rights, title and interest in the easement area subject to 
compatible uses reserved to the landowner; and,
    (4) The right to perform restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management activities on the easement area.
    (c) The landowner shall convey title to the easement which is 
acceptable to the Department. The landowner shall warrant that the 
easement granted to the United States is superior to the rights of all 
others, except for exceptions to the title which are deemed acceptable 
by the Department.
    (d) The landowner shall:
    (1) Comply with the terms of the easement;
    (2) Comply with all terms and conditions of any associated contract;
    (3) Agree to the permanent retirement of any existing cropland base 
and allotment history for the easement area under any program

Sec. 1467.11  The WRPO development.

    (a) The development of the WRPO shall be made through the local 
Department representative, in consultation with the State Technical 
Committee, and with consideration of site specific technical input from 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Conservation District.
    (b) The WRPO shall specify the manner in which the enrolled land 
shall be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to 
accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO shall be developed to 
ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife 
benefits and wetland functions and values will result.

Sec. 1467.12  Modifications.

    (a) Easements. (1) After an easement has been recorded, no 
modification will be made in the easement except by mutual agreement 
with the Chief and the landowner. The Chief will consult with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and the Conservation District prior to making 
any modifications to easements.
    (2) Approved modifications will be made only in an amended easement 
which is duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real 
estate practices, including requirements for title approval, 
subordination of liens, and recordation.
    (3) The Chief may approve modifications to facilitate the practical 
administration and management of the easement area or the program so 
long as the modification will not adversely affect the wetland functions 
and values for which the easement was acquired.
    (4) Modifications must result in equal or greater environmental and 
economic values to the United States.
    (b) WRPO. Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable 
law, the State Conservationist may approve modifications to the WRPO 
that do not affect provisions of the easement in consultation with the 
landowner and the State Technical Committee and following consideration 
of site specific technical input from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and the Conservation District. Any WRPO modification must meet WRP 
program objectives, and must result in equal or greater wildlife 
benefits, wetland functions and values, ecological and economic values 
to the United States. Modifications to the WRPO which are substantial 
and affect provisions of the easement will require

[[Page 662]]

agreement from the landowner and require execution of an amended 
easement.

more restrictive easement and contract terms and conditions.
    (b) Payments to landowners. (1) For easements with multiple annual 
payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original 
landowner unless the Department receives an assignment of proceeds.
    (2) The new landowner or purchaser shall be held responsible for 
assuring completion of all measures and practices required by the 
contract. Eligible cost-share payments shall be made to the new 
landowner upon presentation of an assignment of rights or other evidence 
that title had passed.
    (c) Claims to payments. With respect to any and all payments owed to 
landowners, the United States shall bear no responsibility for any full 
payments or partial distributions of funds between the original 
landowner and the landowner's successor. In the event of a dispute or 
claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, the Department may 
withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement 
or adjudication on the rights to the funds.

be available to the United States under applicable law, the Department 
may withhold any easement and cost-share payments owing to landowners at 
any time there is a material breach of the easement covenants or any 
contract. Such withheld funds may be used to offset costs incurred by 
the United States in any remedial actions or retained as damages 
pursuant to court order or settlement agreement.
    (d) The United States shall be entitled to recover any and all 
administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, 
associated with any enforcement or remedial action.

<R05>
Sec. 1468.1  Purpose.

    (a) Through the Conservation Farm Option (CFO), the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) provides financial assistance to eligible farmers and 
ranchers to address soil, water, and related natural resource concerns, 
water quality protection or improvement; wetland restoration and 
protection; wildlife habitat development and protection; and other 
similar conservation purposes on their lands in an environmentally 
beneficial and cost-effective manner. The Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS) may provide technical assistance, upon request by the 
producer or landowner.
    (b) The CCC provides a single contract and annual payments for 
implementation of innovative and environmentally-sound methods for 
addressing natural resource concerns for producers of wheat, feed 
grains, cotton, and rice, resulting in consolidation of

[[Page 664]]

payments that would have been available under the Conservation Reserve 
Program (CRP), the Wetlands Reserve Program cost-share agreements (WRP), 
and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). CFO 
participation is determined through two step process: first, the Chief, 
with FSA concurrence, selects CFO pilot project areas based on proposals 
submitted by the public; then CCC accepts applications from eligible 
producers or owners within the selected pilot project area.

1466), or WRP (7 CFR part 1467).
    (c) The participant is responsible for the development of a 
conservation farm plan for the farm or ranch and may request assistance 
from NRCS or a third party in writing both the conservation farm plan 
and installing the practices outlined within the plan. Conservation 
practices in the conservation farm plan that would have been eligible 
for payment under CRP, EQIP, or cost-share agreements under WRP are 
eligible for CFO payment. The provisions for determining eligibility for 
payment and the calculation of payment under CFO will be similar to 
those specified for the eligible conservation practices under CRP, EQIP, 
or cost-share agreements under WRP. For land retirement payments, the 
CRP payment schedule in effect for the applicable soils at the time the 
CFO contract is signed will be utilized. CCC will provide annual 
payments to a participant for such conservation practices as specified 
in the time schedule set forth in the conservation farm plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.6  Practice eligibility provisions.

    (a) Practices may be eligible for payment under CFO if the

conservation practice similar to EQIP in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(c).


<R05>
Sec. 1468.9  Conservation farm plan.

    (a) The conservation farm plan forms the basis of the CFO contract. 
Prior to contract approval, a conservation farm plan must be written and 
approved. In deciding whether to approve a conservation farm plan, CCC 
may consider whether:

[[Page 668]]

    (1) The participant will use conservation practices to solve the 
natural resource concerns that will maximize environmental benefits per 
dollar expended, and
    (2) The conservation practice would have been eligible for 
enrollment in the CRP, EQIP, or under the WRP cost-share agreements.
    (b) The conservation farm plan for the farm or ranch unit of concern 
shall:
    (1) Describe any resource conserving crop rotation, and all other 
conservation practices, to be implemented and maintained on the acreage 
that is subject to contract during the contact period;
    (2) Address the resource concerns identified in the CFO pilot 
project area proposal;
    (3) Contain a schedule for the implementation and maintenance of the 
practices described in the conservation farm plan;
    (4) Ensure that net environmental benefits under a CRP contract are 
maintained or exceeded for the whole farm, as constituted by FSA, when 
terminating a CRP contract and enrolling in a CFO contract; and
    (5) Meet the objectives of the pilot project area.
    (c) The conservation farm plan is part of the CFO contract.
    (d) The conservation farm plan must allow the participant to achieve 
a cost-effective resource management system, or some appropriate portion 
of that system, identified in the applicable NRCS field office technical 
guide or as approved by the State Conservationist.
    (e) Participants are responsible for implementing the conservation 
farm plan in compliance with this part.
    (f) Upon a participant's request, the NRCS may provide technical 
assistance to a participant.

professionals, other than NRCS personnel, to provide technical 
assistance. NRCS retains approval authority over the technical adequacy 
of work done by non-NRCS personnel for the purpose of determining CFO 
contract compliance.
    (2) Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel 
not affiliated with NRCS may include, but not limited to: conservation 
planning; conservation practice survey, layout, design, and 
installation; information, education, and training for producers; and 
training and quality assurance for professional conservationists.
    (g) All conservation practices scheduled in the conservation farm 
plan are to be carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS Field 
Office Technical Guide. The State Conservationist may approve use of 
innovative conservation measures that are not contained in the NRCS 
Field Office Technical Guide.
    (h)(1) To simplify the conservation planning process for the 
participant, the conservation farm plan may be developed, at the request 
of the participant, as a single plan that incorporates, other Federal, 
state, Tribal, or local government program or regulatory requirements. 
CCC development or approval of a conservation farm plan shall not 
constitute compliance with program, statutory and regulatory 
requirements administered or enforced by a non-USDA agency, except as 
agreed to by the participant and the relevant Federal, state, local or 
tribal entities.

<R05>
Sec. 1468.20  Application for CFO program participation.

    (a) Any eligible owner or producer within an approved pilot project 
area may submit an application for participation in the CFO to a service 
center or other USDA county or field office(s) of FSA or NRCS, where the 
pilot project area is located.
    (b) CCC will accept applications throughout the fiscal year. CCC 
will rank and select the offers of applicants

[[Page 669]]

periodically, as determined appropriate by the State Conservationist. 
The application period will begin after a pilot project area has been 
approved.
    (c) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the local 
work group, will develop ranking criteria to prioritize applications 
within a pilot project area which consists of more than one owner or 
producer. NRCS will prioritize applications from the same pilot project 
area using the criteria specific to the area. The FSA county committee, 
with the assistance of the designated conservationist and designated FSA 
official, will approve for funding the application in a pilot project 
area based on eligibility factors of the applicant and the NRCS ranking.
    (d) The designated conservationist will work with the applicant to 
collect the information necessary to evaluate the application using the 
ranking criteria. An applicant has the option of offering and accepting 
less than the maximum program payments allowed, offering to apply more 
conservation practices to the land in order to increase the likelihood 
of being enrolled. In evaluating the applications, the designated 
conservationist will take into consideration the following factors:
    (1) Soil erosion;
    (2) Water quality;
    (3) Wildlife benefits;
    (4) Soil productivity;
    (5) Conservation compliance considerations;
    (6) Likelihood to remain in conserving uses beyond the contract 
period, including tree planting and permanent wildlife habitat;
    (7) State water quality priority areas;
    (8) The environmental benefits per dollar expended; and
    (9) The degree to which application is consistent with the pilot 
project proposal.
    (e) If two or more applications have an equal rank, the application 
that will result in the least cost to the program will be given greater 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.21  Contract requirements.

    (a) In order for an applicant to receive annual payments, the 
applicant must enter into a contract agreeing to implement a 
conservation farm plan. The FSA county committee, with NRCS concurrence, 
will use the NRCS ranking consistent with the provisions of Sec. 1468.20 
and grant final approval of the contract.
    (b) A CFO contract will:
    (1) Incorporate by reference all portions of a conservation farm 
plan applicable to CFO;
    (2) Be for a duration of 10 years, and may be renewed, subject to 
the availability of funds, for a period not to exceed 5 years upon 
mutual agreement of CCC and the participant;
    (3) Provide that the participant will:
    (i) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch unit of concern 
consistent with the goals of the contract that would tend to defeat the 
purposes of the contract, or reduce net environmental and societal 
benefits;
    (ii) Refund with interest any program payments received and forfeit 
any future payments under the program, on the violation of a term or 
condition of the contract, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1468.25 of this part;
    (iii) Refund all program payments received on the transfer of the 
right and interest of the producer in land subject to the contract, 
unless the transferee of the right and interest agrees to assume all 
obligations of the contract, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1468.24 of this part;
    (iv) Agree to forego participation in CRP, EQIP, and the cost-share 
agreements under WRP, along with future payments associated with these 
programs, with regard to the land under the CFO contract;
    (v) Supply information as required by CCC to determine compliance 
with the contract and requirements of the program;
    (4) Specify the participant's requirements for operation and 
maintenance of the applied conservation practices in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1468.22 of this part, and
    (5) Include any other provision determined necessary or appropriate 
by CCC.
    (c) There is a limit of one CFO contract at any one time for each 
farm, as constituted by FSA.
    (d) The contract will incorporate the operation and maintenance of 
conservation practices applied under the

[[Page 670]]

contract, including those practices transferred from terminated CRP and 
EQIP contracts and WRP cost-share agreements. For persons wishing to 
transfer from CRP, EQIP, or WRP to CFO, practices included in CRP or 
EQIP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements must be included in a CFO 
contract if an owner or producer wishes to participate, unless otherwise 
stated in the conservation farm plan.
    (e) Acreage that is subject to a WRP easement will not be included 
in the CFO contract.
    (f) Upon completion, the participant must certify that a 
conservation practice is completed in accordance with the conservation 
farm plan to establish compliance with the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.22  Conservation practice operation and maintenance.

    (a) The participant will operate and maintain the conservation 
practice for its intended purpose for the life span of the conservation 
practice, as identified in the conservation farm plan. Conservation 
practices installed before the execution of a CFO contract, but needed 
in the contract to obtain the environmental benefits agreed upon, are to 
be operated and maintained as specified in the contract. NRCS may 
periodically inspect the conservation practice during the lifespan of 
the practice as specified in the contract to ensure that the operation 
and maintenance is occurring.
    (b) For those persons who are signatories to existing CRP or EQIP 
contracts, or WRP cost-share agreements, practices will be transferred 
from EQIP and CRP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements, as agreed upon 
in the CFO conservation farm plan and CFO contract. Remaining rights and 
obligations under CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be incorporated into the new 
CFO contract. Practices included in CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be 
incorporated into the new CFO contract. Practices included in CRP or 
EQIP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements must be included in a CFO 
contract if an owner or producer wishes to participate. Participants in 
CFO with CRP, EQIP, or WRP practices incorporated into CFO contracts are 
responsible for operating and maintaining these practices for the 
balance of the period specified in the original program contract, unless 
otherwise stated in the conservation farm plan and CFO contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.23  Annual payments.

    (a) CCC will determine annual payments, subject to the availability 
of funds, based on the value of the expected payments that would have 
been paid to the participant for that practice as specified in:
    (1) Part 1410 of this chapter, if the practice is a land retirement 
rental payment or cost-share practice which would have qualified for 
payment under CRP in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(a);
    (2) Part 1467 of this chapter, if the practice is a wetland 
restoration or protection practice which would have qualified for 
payment under WRP which was determined eligible in accordance with 
Sec. 1468.6(b);
    (3) Part 1466 of this chapter, if the practice was a conservation 
practice which would have qualified for payment under EQIP which was 
determined eligible in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(c);
    (b) The maximum amount of annual payments which a person may receive 
under the CFO for any fiscal year shall not exceed the total of the 
amounts calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section 
after being limited as follows:
    (1) The payment calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section is limited in accordance with CRP payment limitation 
provisions set forth in part 1410 of this chapter.
    (2) The payment calculated in accordance with Sec. 1467.9(a)(2) of 
this chapter is not limited.
    (3) The payment calculated in accordance with Sec. 1466.23(a)(3) of 
this chapter is limited in accordance with EQIP payment limitation 
provisions in Sec. 1466.23(b) of this chapter.
    (c) The regulations set forth at part 1400 of this chapter will be 
applicable in making payment eligibility determinations for CFO and in 
making person determination as they apply to the limitation of payments 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 671]]

    (d) The CCC cost-share payments to a participant shall be reduced so 
that total financial contributions for a structural or vegetative 
practice from all public and private entity sources do not exceed the 
cost of the practice.
    (e) A landowner or producer that enrolls in CFO and terminates a CRP 
or EQIP contract or WRP cost-share agreement will be eligible to receive 
payments for practices which have been determined, established, or 
completed by the technical agency under those contracts or agreements. 
Once the CFO contract is effective, all payments for practices, 
including any practice transferred from the terminated contract 
agreement will be made under the CFO contract, except for payments 
already earned under prior contracts or cost-share agreements.
    (f) Payments will not be made to a participant who has applied or 
initiated the application of a conservation practice for the purposes of 
CFO prior to approval of the CFO contract.
    (g) When requested by the State Conservationist on a case-by-case 
basis, the Chief may approve, based upon availability of funding, cost 
share on the reapplication of a practice to replace or repair practice 
destroyed by unusual circumstances beyond the control of the landowner.
    (h) The participant and NRCS must certify that a conservation 
practice is completed in accordance with the conservation farm plan to 
establish compliance with the contract before the CCC will approve the 
payment of any cost-share, incentive, or land retirement payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.24  Contract modifications and transfers of land.

    (a) The participant and CCC may modify a contract if the participant 
and CCC agree to the contract modification and the conservation farm 
plan is revised in accordance with CCC requirements and is approved by 
the conservation district.
    (b) The participant may agree to transfer a contract to another 
eligible owner or operator with the agreement of CCC. The transferee 
shall assume full responsibility under the contract, including operation 
and maintenance of those conservation practices already installed and to 
be installed as a condition of the contract. By agreeing to participate 
in CFO, CCC may require operation and maintenance of those conservation 
practices installed under CRP, EQIP, or WRP.
    (c) CCC may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any 
assistance earned under a CRP or EQIP contract, or WRP cost-share 
agreement that was terminated as a condition of participation in CFO, if 
the participant sells or loses control of the land under a CFO contract 
and the new owner or controller does not assume responsibility under the 
contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.25  Contract violations and termination.

    (a)(1) If it is determined that a participant is in violation of the 
provisions of this part, or the terms of the contract including portions 
of the contract that incorporate transferred obligations from CRP or 
EQIP contracts, or WRP cost-share agreements, CCC will give the 
participant written notice of a reasonable time to correct the violation 
and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto, as 
determined by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS. If a 
participant continues in violation after the time to comply has elapsed, 
the FSA county committee may, in consultation with NRCS, terminate the 
CFO contract.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a contract termination shall be effective immediately upon a 
determination by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS, 
that the participant has submitted false information, filed a false 
claim, or engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for 
payments is permitted under the provisions of Sec. 1468.35 of this part, 
or in a case in which the actions of the party involved are deemed to be 
sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without 
delay.
    (b)(1) If CCC terminates a contract, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for future payments under the contract and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received, plus interest, determined in 
accordance with part 1403 of

[[Page 672]]

this chapter. CCC has the option of requiring only partial refund of the 
payments received if a previously installed conservation practice can 
function independently, is not affected by the violation or other 
conservation practices that would have been installed under the 
contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain the 
installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.
    (2) If CCC terminates a contract for any reason stated above, before 
any contractual payments have been made, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for further payments under the contract and shall pay such 
liquidated damages as are prescribed in the contract.
    (3) When making all contract termination decisions, CCC may reduce 
the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which 
reflects the good-faith effort of the participant to comply with the 
contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have 
prevented compliance with the contract.
    (4) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract without 
penalty, if CCC determines that such termination would be in the public 
interest.

    If a participant relied upon the advice or action of any authorized 
representative of CCC, and did not know or have reason to know that the 
action or advice was improper or erroneous, the FSA county committee, in 
consultation with NRCS, may accept the advice or action as meeting the 
requirements of the program and may grant relief, to the extent it is 
deemed desirable, to provide a fair and equitable treatment because of 
the good-faith reliance on the part of the participant.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.34  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof to any participant shall be made without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any

any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this 
part shall not be entitled to contract payments and must refund to CCC 
all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of 
this chapter.
    (b) An applicant or participant who is determined to have knowingly 
adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the 
program; made any fraudulent representation; or misrepresented any fact 
affecting a program determination, shall refund to CCC all payments, 
plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, 
received by such applicant or participant with respect to CFO contracts.

the requirements for CMA's in part 1425 of this title may be eligible to 
obtain a loan on behalf of those members who themselves are eligible to 
obtain a loan provided that:
    (1) The beneficial interest in the mohair must always, until loan 
repayment or forfeiture, remain in the member who delivered the mohair 
to the eligible CMA or its member CMA's, except as otherwise provided in 
this part; and
    (2) The mohair delivered to an eligible CMA shall establish 
eligibility for a loan if the member who delivered the mohair does not 
retain the right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of the 
mohair as provided in part 1425 of this title.
    (h)(1) To be eligible to receive loans under this part a producer 
must have the beneficial interest in the mohair that is tendered to CCC 
for a loan. The producer must always have had the beneficial interest in 
the mohair unless, before the mohair was sheared, the producer and a 
former producer whom the producer tendering the mohair to CCC has 
succeeded had such an interest in the mohair. Mohair obtained by gift or 
purchase shall not be eligible to be tendered to CCC for loans. Heirs 
who succeed to the beneficial interest of a deceased producer or who 
assume the decedent's obligations under an existing loan shall be 
eligible to receive loans whether succession to the mohair occurs before 
or after shearing so long as the heir otherwise complies with the 
provisions of this part.
    (2) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the mohair if the producer retains control, 
title, and risk of loss in the mohair including the right to make all 
decisions regarding the tender of such mohair to CCC for a loan, and the 
producer takes one of the following actions:
    (i) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, with respect to such 
mohair if all other eligibility requirements are met and the option to 
purchase contains the following provision:

    Not withstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the mohair, as specified 
in 7 CFR part 1469, shall remain with the producer until the buyer 
exercises this option to purchase the mohair. This option to purchase 
shall expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either the 
producer or the buyer, at the earlier of: (1) the maturity of any CCC 
loan which is secured by such mohair; (2) the date the CCC claims title 
to such mohair; or (3) such other date as provided in this option.

    (ii) Enters into a contract to sell the mohair if the producer 
retains title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the mohair and 
the purchaser does not pay to the producer any advance payment amount or 
any incentive payment amount to enter into such contract except as 
provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (3) If loans are made available to producers through an approved CMA 
in accordance with part 1425 of this chapter, the beneficial interest in 
the mohair must always have been in the producer-member who delivered 
the mohair to the CMA or its member CMA's, except as otherwise provided 
in this section. Mohair delivered to such a CMA shall not be eligible 
for loans if the producer-member who delivered the mohair does not 
retain the right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of the 
mohair as provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (i) A producer may, before the final date for obtaining a loan for 
mohair, re-offer as loan mohair any mohair that has been previously 
pledged and redeemed as loan mohair.
    (ii) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 1469.5  Application, availability, disbursement, and maturity.

    (a) The deadline for requesting a loan offered under this part is 
September 30, 1999, for FY 1999 and September 30, 2000, for FY 2000.
    (b) Loans mature on demand but not later than the last day of the 
twelfth

[[Page 677]]

calendar month following the month in which the note and security 
agreement was approved. When the final maturity date falls on a non-
workday for county offices, CCC shall extend the final date to the next 
workday.
    (c) A producer must request loans on mohair at the county office 
serving the county where the headquarters of the producer's farm, ranch, 
or feed lot is located. If the producer has more than one farm, ranch, 
or feed lot, with headquarters in more than one county, separate non-
duplicative applications for loans may be filed with the county office 
serving each such headquarters covering only the mohair at each such 
location. A CMA must request loans at the county office for the county 
in which the principal office of the CMA is located unless the State 
committee designates another county office. If the CMA has operations in 
two or more States, the CMA must file its loan applications at the 
county office for the county in which its principal office for each 
State is located.
    (d) Loans will be made on the mohair (i.e., adult, yearling, spring 
kid, fall kid) as declared and certified by the producer on Form CCC-633 
(Mohair), (Mohair Loan Certification and Worksheet) at the time the 
mohair is pledged as collateral for a loan.
    (e) CCC shall not approve a loan application until the producer 
provides adequate assurance that the loan and all related charges will 
be paid to CCC in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. The 
disbursement of loans will be made by county offices on behalf of CCC.
    (f) The loan rate under this part shall be $2 per pound for all 
mohair eligible to be pledged as collateral under this part. Until the 
loan and all related charges have been paid, CCC shall retain (and the 
producer shall agree that CCC shall retain) a first and superior 
security interest on all of the producer's current and future production 
of mohair, the security interest shall not be restricted to the mohair 
used in calculating the amount of the loan but shall cover all mohair 
(current and future) owned by the producer. Proceeds from the sale of 
loan mohair will be applied to the loan. Proceeds from the sale of non-
loan mohair in which CCC holds a security interest will be applied to 
the loan only if the proceeds from the sale of the loan mohair are 
inadequate to pay the loan in full. The security interest shall also 
apply to the current and future mohair production of affiliated 
producers as defined in this part. CCC may require such additional 
security as it deems needed to assure repayment of the loan. In the 
event that the producer's present capability for producing mohair is 
such that a security interest on the producer's current and future 
production of mohair is not deemed to be sufficient, or if the loan is 
otherwise considered to be insufficiently secured, the CCC, as 
determined by the Executive Vice President, CCC, may require that 75 
cents per pound, or such other amount as may be deemed appropriate by 
the Executive Vice President (taking into consideration the market value 
of the mohair) be deducted from the loan to provide additional security. 
Producers, in lieu of such reduction, may provide a letter of credit, 
bond, or other form of security for the reduction amount, as approved by 
CCC. The Executive Vice President, CCC, may allow for releases from the 
security interest provided for in this section as needed to accomplish 
the goals of the program, and require the necessary assurances to 
determine the future production capability of a producer seeking a loan 
under this part.
    (g) If, after a loan is made, CCC determines that the producer or 
the mohair collateral is not in compliance with any of the provisions of 
this part, the producer shall refund the total amount disbursed under 
loan together with interest and other charges as may apply, including 
late payment interest as provided in part 1403 of this title.

<R05>
Sec. 1469.6  Security interests.

    (a) CCC's security interest in the mohair pledged as collateral is 
first and superior to all other security interests.
    (b) The county office may file or record, as required by State law, 
all financing statements needed to perfect a security interest in mohair 
pledged as collateral for loans. The cost of filing

[[Page 678]]

and recording shall be for the account of CCC.
    (c) If there are any security interests or encumbrances on the 
mohair, waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC must be obtained. 
For non-loan mohair which is subject to the security interest provided 
for in this part, CCC may require waivers of pre-existing security 
interests.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.7  Fees.

    A producer shall pay a non-refundable loan service fee to CCC at a 
rate determined by CCC. The amount of such fees will be available in 
State and county offices.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.8  Determination of quantity.

    The amount of a loan on the quantity of eligible loan mohair shall 
be based on 100 percent of the net weight in pounds of such quantity 
certified by the producer and verified by the warehouse for mohair which 
is pledged as security for the loan and covered by the note and security 
agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.9  Transfer of producer's interest prohibited.

    Absent written approval from CCC, the producer shall not transfer 
either the remaining interest in, or right to redeem, the mohair pledged 
as collateral for a loan nor shall anyone acquire such interest or 
right. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1469.12, a producer who wishes 
to liquidate all or part of a loan by contracting for the sale of the 
loan mohair must obtain written approval of the county office on a form 
prescribed by CCC to remove a specified quantity of the mohair from 
storage. Any such approval shall be subject to the terms and conditions 
set forth in the applicable form, copies of which may be obtained by 
producers at the county office.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.10  Loss or damage.

    The producer is responsible for any loss in quantity or quality of 
the mohair pledged as collateral for a loan. CCC shall not assume any 
loss in quantity or quality of the loan collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.11  Personal liability of the producer.

    (a) When applying for an individual or joint loan, each producer 
agrees:
    (1) When signing any document, including Form CCC-633 (Mohair), 
(Mohair Loan Certification and Worksheet) and Form CCC-677 (Farm Storage 
Note and Security Agreement), that the producer will:
    (i) Provide correct, accurate, and truthful certifications and 
representations of the loan quantity and all other matters of fact and 
interest; and
    (ii) Not remove or dispose of any amount of the loan quantity 
without prior written approval from CCC in accordance with this section; 
and
    (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of this part and Form 
CCC-677 will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed 
to the producer for a loan quantity which is not actually in existence 
or for an amount of mohair for which the producer is not eligible.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a ``violation'' shall refer to any 
violation of the loan agreement and this part which shall include, but 
not be limited to, any incorrect certification made with respect to 
obtaining a loan, any misrepresentation with respect to a loan, or any 
mis-disposition of loan collateral.
    (c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for conduct which is 
in violation of this part or the loan agreement. Accordingly, if the 
county committee determines that the producer has engaged in any such 
violation, liquidated damages shall be assessed and shall be due in 
addition to any loan refund that may be due plus interest and charges. 
The amount of such liquidated damages shall be computed using the 
quantity of mohair that is involved in the violation and the formula set 
out below. If CCC determines the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity of mohair involved 
in the violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
first offense; or

[[Page 679]]

    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for 
cases other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note.
    (d) When liquidated damages are assessed in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan 
quantity which was the subject of the violation plus charges, plus 
interest applicable to the amount repaid; and
    (2) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days 
from the date of notification, call the applicable loan in its entirety, 
plus charges, plus interest assessed from the date of the loan 
disbursement.
    (e) When liquidated damages are assessed in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the county committee shall call the 
loan in its entirety, plus charges, plus interest assessed from the date 
of the loan disbursement.
    (f) The county committee:
    (1) May waive the administrative actions taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section if the county committee 
determines that the violation occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or 
unintentionally.
    (2) Shall furnish a copy of its determination to the State 
committee, and the Administrator. If the determination of the county 
committee is not disapproved by either the State committee or the 
Administrator, or a designee, within 60 calendar days from the date the 
determination is received, such determination may be considered to have 
been approved unless the Administrator issues procedures that allow for 
more time, or decides in an individual case that more time is needed.
    (g) If, there is any violation of the loan agreement or this part, 
the loan may be terminated in which case there must be a full refund of 
the loan plus interest, and costs.
    (h) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
violated this part or the loan agreement, the county committee shall 
notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances which caused the violation, to 
the county committee, and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken in accordance with 
paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.
    (i)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent or misleading 
representation in obtaining, maintaining, or settling a loan, the 
producer shall be liable for:
    (i) The amount of the loan;
    (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC with respect to the loan;
    (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation;
    (iv) Late payment interest as may be provided for in part 1403 of 
this title; and
    (v) Liquidated damages assessed under paragraph (c) of this section; 
and
    (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent or misleading 
representation to CCC, the value of the settlement for such collateral 
removed by CCC shall be determined by CCC according to Sec. 1469.14.
    (j) If the amount disbursed under a loan or in settlement thereof, 
exceeds the amount authorized under this part, the producer shall be 
personally liable for repayment of such excess, plus charges, plus 
interest, and for any other sanction as may be allowed by law.
    (k) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan is less than the amount required in accordance with this part, the 
producer shall be personally liable for repayment of the amount of such 
deficiency plus charges, plus interest.
    (l) In the case of joint loans, the personal liability for the 
amounts specified in this section shall be joint and several on the part 
of each producer signing or responsible under the loan note. Further, 
each producer who is a party to a joint loan will be jointly and 
severally liable for any violation of the

[[Page 680]]

terms and conditions of the note, security agreement, and the 
regulations set forth in this part. Each such producer shall also remain 
liable for repayment of the entire loan amount until the loan is fully 
repaid without regard to such producer's claimed share in the mohair, or 
loan proceeds, after execution of the note and security agreement by 
CCC.
    (m) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by CCC.
    (n) Remedies set out here are in addition to remedies the CCC will 
have through its security interest on non-loan mohair which secures the 
repayment of the loan made on the loan mohair.
    (o) All remedies provided for in this section or part are in 
addition to any remedies as may otherwise be provided for in law.

Sec. 1469.12  Release of the mohair pledged as collateral for a loan.

    (a)(1) A producer shall not move or dispose of any loan mohair 
pledged as collateral for a loan until prior written approval for such 
removal or disposition has been received from the county committee in 
accordance with this section.
    (2) A producer may at any time obtain a release of all or part of 
the mohair remaining as loan collateral by paying to CCC the amount of 
the loan and any charges which had been made by CCC to the producer with 
respect to the quantity of the loan mohair released.
    (3) When the proceeds of a sale of loan mohair are needed to repay 
all or part of a loan, the producer must request and obtain prior 
written approval of the county office on a form prescribed by CCC in 
order to remove a specified quantity of the mohair from storage. Any 
such approval shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in 
the applicable form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the 
county office. Any such approval shall not constitute a release of CCC's 
security interest in the commodity or release the producer from 
liability for any amounts due and owing to CCC with respect to any loan 
indebtedness. With respect to non-loan mohair securing the loan, CCC 
may, in its discretion, release its security interest in the mohair if 
there are no loan amounts overdue at the time of the release.
    (b) The note and security agreement shall not be released until all 
loan liability has been satisfied in full.
    (c) After satisfaction of a loan, CCC shall release CCC's security 
interest in the mohair at the producer's request. The producer shall be 
responsible for payment of any fee for such release if such fee can be 
determined.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.13  Liquidation of loans.

    (a)(1) For loans made in FY 1999, the producer is require to repay 
the loan on or before maturity by payment of the amount of loan, plus 
any charges.
    (2) For loans made in FY 2000, the producer is required to repay the 
loan on or before maturity by payment of the amount of loan plus 
interest, as applicable, and any charges.
    (b) If a producer fails to settle the loan in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section within 30 calendar days from the maturity 
date of such loan, or other reasonable time period as established by 
CCC, a claim shall be established for the loan amount plus interest and 
any charges. CCC shall inform the producer before the maturity date of 
the loan of the date by which the loan must be settled or a claim will 
be established in accordance with part 1403 of this title. A failure to 
pay the loan in a timely manner will start the accrual of late payment 
interest, and costs.

<R05>
Sec. 1469.14  Foreclosure.

    (a) Upon maturity and nonpayment of the loan, title to the 
unredeemed loan mohair securing the loan shall vest in CCC.
    (b) If the total amount due on a loan or the unpaid amount of the 
note and charges is not satisfied upon maturity, CCC may remove the loan 
mohair from storage and assign, transfer, and deliver the mohair or 
documents evidencing title thereto at such time, in such manner, and 
upon such terms as CCC may determine at a public or private

[[Page 681]]

sale. Any such disposition may also be effected without removing the 
mohair from storage. CCC may become the purchaser of the whole or any 
part of the mohair at either a public or private sale.
    (c) If the mohair is removed from storage by CCC and is sold, the 
value of the settlement shall be the proceeds from the sale of the 
mohair minus costs associated with the disposition of the mohair, and:
    (1) If the value of the collateral computed at settlement is less 
than the amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such 
deficiency plus charges, plus interest on such deficiency and CCC may 
take any action against the producer to recover the deficiency; or
    (2) If the proceeds received from the sale of the loan mohair so 
computed are greater than the sum of the amount due, such excess shall 
be paid to the producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of 
the producer.
    (d) In addition, CCC may take any action with respect to non-loan 
mohair as may be needed to assure collection of all loans including, if 
need be, possession of the mohair. Nothing in this section of this part 
shall constitute a waiver of its lien on such mohair except when an 
express waiver has been executed by CCC. Absent such a waiver, all 
proceeds from such mohair shall be the property of CCC until the 
producer's loans have been repaid in full.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.15  Handling payments and collections not exceeding $9.99.

    In order to avoid administrative costs of making small payments and 
handling small accounts, amounts of $9.99 or less which are due the 
producer will be paid only upon the producer's request. Deficiencies of 
$9.99 or less may be disregarded by CCC unless demand for payment is 
made by CCC.

Sec. 1469.16  Death, incompetency, or disappearance; other regulations, additional loan provisions.

    (a) In the case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any 
producer who is entitled to the payment of any sum in settlement of a 
loan, payment shall, upon proper application to the county office which 
made the loan, be made to the persons who would be entitled to such 
producer's share under the regulations contained in part 707 of this 
title. Applications for loans may be made upon application of a 
representative of the producer as allowed under standard practice for 
farm programs.
    (b) Appeals of adverse decisions made under this part shall be 
subject to the provisions of 7 CFR parts 11 and 780.

Sec. 1470.4  Time and method of application.

    (a) Apple producers may obtain an application, Form CCC-891 (Apple 
Market Loss Assistance Payment Application), in person, by mail, by 
telephone, or by facsimile from any county FSA office. In addition, 
applicants may download a copy of the CCC-891 at http://
www.sc.egov.usda.gov.
    (b) A request for benefits under this subpart must be submitted on a 
completed Form CCC-891. The Form CCC-891 should be submitted to the 
county FSA office serving the county where the apple operation is 
located but, in any case, must be received by the county FSA office by 
the close of business on April 13, 2001. Applications not received by 
the close of business on April 13, 2001, will be disapproved as not 
having been timely filed and the apple operation will not be eligible 
for benefits under this program.
    (c) All persons who share in an apple operation's total production 
must certify on the same CCC-891 in order to obtain the maximum eligible 
quantity of the higher crop year of 1998 and 1999 of the apple operation 
before the application is complete.
    (d) The apple operation requesting benefits under this subpart must 
certify with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information 
provided in their application for benefits. All information provided is 
subject to verification and spot checks by CCC. Refusal to allow CCC or 
any other agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any 
information provided will result in a determination of ineligibility. 
Data furnished by the applicant will be used to determine eligibility 
for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without 
it program benefits will not be approved. Providing a false 
certification to the Government is punishable by imprisonment, fines and 
other penalties.

dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the 
general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their 
duly authorized representatives must sign the application for payment.
    (c) An apple operation must submit a timely application and comply

documents to assist the county FSA office in verifying the operation's 
apple production indicated on Form CCC-891. Examples of supporting 
documentation include, but are not limited to: picking, packout, and 
payroll records, RMA records, sales documents, copies of receipts, 
ledgers of income, or any other documents available to confirm the

year from all approved applications; and
    (2) Dividing the amount available for the Apple Market Loss 
Assistance Payment program by the total pounds of eligible production 
submitted and approved for payment (the quantity determined under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section).

[[Page 692]]

    (b) Each apple operation payment will be calculated by multiplying 
the payment rate determined in paragraph (a) of this section by the

<R05>
Sec. 1477.101  Applicability.

    (a) This part sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to the 
1998 Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program. Under sections 1101 and 1102 
of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (``1999 Act'') (Pub. L. 105-
277, 112 Stat. 2681), the Secretary of Agriculture will make disaster 
payments available to certain producers who have incurred losses in 
quantity or quality of their crops due to disasters. Producers will be 
able to receive benefits under this part for losses to 1998 crops, or 
losses occurring in at least 3 years for which payments were received 
for the period 1994 through 1998, as determined by the Secretary. 
Accordingly, this part contains three subparts. Subpart A contains 
general provisions applicable to both the single-year and multi-year 
aspects of the 1998 Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program, which are 
contained in Subparts B and C, respectively.
    (b) In accordance with section 1102(g)(2) of the 1999 Act, the 
Secretary has authorized use of a portion of the funds authorized by the 
Act to establish crop insurance premium discounts for the 1999 crop year 
(2000 crop year for citrus fruit, avocados in California,

[[Page 706]]

and macadamia nuts in Hawaii). This part establishes provisions and 
requirements for implementation of those discounts.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.102  Administration.

    (a) The program will be administered under the general supervision 
of the Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and 
shall be carried out in the field by State and county Farm Service 
Agency (FSA) committees.
    (b) State and county FSA committees and representatives do not have 
the authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of this part.
    (c) The State FSA committee shall take any action required by this 
part which has not been taken by a county FSA committee. The State FSA 
committee shall also:
    (1) Correct or require a county FSA committee to correct any action 
taken by such county FSA committee which is not in accordance with this 
part; and
    (2) Require a county FSA committee to withhold taking or reverse any 
action which is not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No delegation herein to a State or county FSA committee shall 
prevent the Deputy Administrator from determining any question arising 
under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made 
by a State or county FSA committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize the State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines or other program requirements in 
cases where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does not 
adversely affect the operation of the program or when, in his 
discretion, it is determined that an exception should be allowed to 
provide for a more equitable distribution of benefits consistent with 
the goals of the program provided for in this part.

    (c) A person shall be ineligible to receive disaster assistance 
under this part if it is determined by the State or county committee or 
an official of FSA that such person has:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or other device which tends to defeat the 
purpose of a program operated under this part;

[[Page 713]]

    (2) Made any fraudulent representation with respect to such program; 
or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (d) In the event there is a failure to comply with any term, 
requirement, or condition for payment or assistance arising under this 
part, and if any refund of a payment to CCC shall otherwise become due 
in connection with this part, all payments made in regard to such matter 
shall be refunded to CCC, together with interest as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and late-payment charges 
as provided for in part 1403 of this chapter.
    (e) Producers shall be required to pay interest on any refund 
required of the producer receiving assistance or a payment if CCC 
determines that payments or other assistance were provided to the 
producer and the producer was not eligible for such assistance. The 
interest rate shall be one percent greater than the rate of interest 
which the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date 
of payment. Interest that is determined to be due CCC shall accrue from 
the date such benefits were made available by CCC to the date repayment 
is completed. CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC determines 
that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any error 
by the producer.
    (f) All persons with a financial interest in the operation receiving 
benefits under this part shall be jointly and severally liable for any 
refund, including related charges, which is determined to be due CCC for 
any reason under this part.
    (g) In the event that any request for assistance or payment under 
this part was established as result of erroneous information or a 
miscalculation, the assistance or payment shall be recomputed and any 
excess refunded with applicable interest.
    (h) The liability of any person for any penalty under this part or 
for any refund to CCC or related charge arising in connection therewith 
shall be in addition to any other liability of such person under any 
civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law including, 
but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001 and 1014; 15 
U.S.C. 714m; and 31 U.S.C. 3729.
    (i) Any person who is dissatisfied with a determination made with 
respect to this part may make a request for reconsideration or appeal of 
such determination in accordance with the regulations set forth at parts 
11 and 780 of this title.
    (j) Any payment or portion thereof to any person shall be made 
without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard 
to any claim or lien again the crop, or proceeds thereof.
    (k) Disaster benefits under this part may be made without taking any 
applicable offsets.
    (l) Payments which are earned under this part may be assigned in 
accordance with the provisions of part 1404 of this chapter upon filling 
out the applicable assignment form.
    (m) For the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 3201(e), the restriction on 
receipt of funds or benefits under this program is waived; however, this 
waiver shall not preclude withholding or offsetting where it is deemed 
by the Deputy Administrator to be appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 1477.110  Matters of general applicability.

    (a) For calculations of loss made with respect to insured crops, the 
producer's existing unit structure will be used as the basis for the 
calculation and may include optional units established according to 7 
CFR Part 457 of this Title. For uninsured and noninsurable crops, basic 
units will be established for these purposes.
    (b) Loss payment rates and factors shall be established by the state 
committee based on procedures provided by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) County average yield for loss calculations will be the simple 
average of the 1993 through 1997 official county yields established by 
FSA.
    (d) County committees will assign production when the county 
committee determines:
    (1) An acceptable appraisal or record of harvested production does 
not exist;
    (2) The loss is due to an ineligible cause of loss or practices that 
cause

[[Page 714]]

lower yields than those upon which the historic yield is based;
    (3) The producer has a contract providing a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop;
    (4) The crop is planted beyond the normal planting period for the 
crop; or
    (5) Other cause, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, exists 
for such case.
    (e) The county committee shall establish a maximum loss level based 
on other losses in the county for the same crop. The maximum loss level 
for the county shall be expressed as either a percent of loss or yield 
per acre. The maximum loss level will apply when:
    (1) Unharvested acreage has not been appraised by FSA, RMA, FCIC, a 
company reinsured by FCIC, or other appraiser;
    (2) The crop's loss is because of an ineligible disaster condition 
or circumstances other than a natural disaster; or
    (3) Acceptable production records for harvested acres are not 
available from any source.
    (f) Assigned production for practices that result in lower yields 
than those for which the historic yield is based shall be established 
by:
    (1) Determining the acres planted to the low-yielding type of 
practice;
    (2) Multiplying the State office determined yield reduction factor 
times the county average yield; and
    (3) Multiplying the result of paragraph (f)(2) of this section times 
the acres in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (g) Assigned production for crops planted beyond the normal planting 
period for the crop shall be calculated according to the lateness of 
planting the crop. If the crop is planted after the final planting date 
by:
    (1) 1 through 10 calendar days, the assigned production will be 
based on one percent of the payment yield for each day involved.
    (2) 11 through 24 calendar days, the assigned production will be 
based on 10 percent of the payment yield plus an additional two percent 
reduction of the payment yield for each days of days 11 through 24 which 
are involved.
    (3) 25 or more calendar days or a date in which the crop would not 
reasonably be expected to mature by harvest, the assigned production 
will be based on 50 percent of the payment yield or such greater amount 
determined by the county committee to be appropriate.
    (h) Assigned production for producers with contracts to receive a 
guaranteed payment for production of an eligible crop will be 
established by the county committee by:
    (1) Determining the total amount of guaranteed payment for the unit;
    (2) Converting the guaranteed payment to guaranteed production by 
dividing the total amount of guaranteed payment by the approved county 
price for the crop or variety or such other factor deemed appropriate if 
otherwise the production would appear to be too high; and
    (3) Establishing the production for the unit as the greater of the 
actual net production for the unit or the guaranteed payment.

    Subpart B--1998 Single-Year Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program


<R05>
Sec. 1477.201  Single-year crop losses.

    (a) To receive disaster benefits under this subpart which covers 
single-year 1998 crop losses, the county committee must determine that 
because of a disaster, the producer with respect to the 1998 crop year:
    (1) Was prevented from planting a crop;
    (2) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the expected 
production of a crop;
    (3) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the value for value 
loss crops; or
    (4) Sustained damage in excess of 20 percent of an individual stand 
of eligible trees, after adjustments for normal mortality.
    (b) Calculation of benefits under this subpart shall not include 
losses:
    (1) That are the result of poor management decisions or poor farming 
practices as determined by the county committee on a case-by-case basis 
based on instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator;
    (2) That are the result of the failure of the producer to reseed or 
replant to the same crop in the county where it is

[[Page 715]]

customary to reseed or replant after a loss;
    (3) That are not as a result of a natural disaster;
    (4) To crops not intended for harvest in crop year 1998;
    (5) To losses of by-products resulting from processing or harvesting 
a crop, such as cotton seed, peanut shells, wheat or oat straw;
    (6) To home gardens; or
    (7) As a result of water contained or released by any governmental, 
public, or private dam or reservoir project if an easement exists on the 
acreage affected for the containment or release of the water.
    (c) Calculation of benefits under this subpart for ornamental 
nursery stock shall not include losses:
    (1) Caused by a failure of power supply or brownouts;
    (2) Caused by the inability to market nursery stock as a result of 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;
    (3) Caused by fire;
    (4) Affecting crops where weeds and other forms of undergrowth in 
the vicinity of the nursery stock have not been controlled; or
    (5) Caused by the collapse or failure of buildings or structures.
    (d) Calculation of benefits under this subpart for honey where the 
honey production by colonies or bees was diminished, shall not include 
losses:
    (1) Where the inability to extract was due to the unavailability of 
equipment; the collapse or failure of equipment or apparatus used in the 
honey operation;
    (2) Resulting from improper storage of honey;
    (3) To honey production because of bee feeding;
    (4) Caused by the application of chemicals;
    (5) Caused by theft, fire, or vandalism;
    (6) Caused by the movement of bees by the producer or any other 
person; or
    (7) Due to disease or pest infestation of the colonies.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.202  Calculating rates and yields.

    (a) Payment rates for 1998 single-year crop losses shall be:
    (1) 65 percent of the maximum established RMA price for insured 
crops;
    (2) 65 percent of the State average price for noninsurable crops;
    (3) 60 percent of the maximum established RMA price for uninsured 
crops; and
    (4) 65 percent of the established practice rate for damage to 
eligible trees.
    (b) Disaster benefits under this subpart for losses to crops other 
than trees shall be made in an amount determined by multiplying the loss 
of production in excess of 35 percent of the expected production by the 
applicable payment rate established according to paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Disaster benefits under this subpart for losses of trees shall 
be made in an amount determined by multiplying the quantity of acres or 
number of trees in a practice approved by the county committee according 
to instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, by the payment rate 
established according to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Separate payment rates and yields for the same crop may be 
established according to instructions issued by the Deputy 
Administrator, when there is supporting data from NASS or other sources 
approved by CCC that show there is a significant difference in yield or 
value based on a distinct and separate end use of the crop. In spite of 
differences in yield or values, separate rates or yields shall not be 
established for crops with different cultural practices, such as 
organically or hydroponically grown.
    (e) Each eligible producer's share of a disaster payment shall be 
based on the producer's share of the crop or crop proceeds, or, if no 
crop was produced, the share the producer would have received if the 
crop had been produced. In cases where crop insurance provides for a 
landlord/tenant to insure the tenant/landlord's share according to part 
457 of this title, disaster payments will be issued on the same basis.
    (f) When calculating a payment for a unit loss:
    (1) The unharvested payment factor shall be applied to crop acreage 
planted but not harvested; and
    (2) The prevented planting factor shall be applied to any prevented 
planted acreage eligible for payment.

[[Page 716]]

    (g) Production from all end uses of a multi-use crop or all 
secondary uses for multiple market crops will be calculated separately 
and summarized together.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.203  Production losses, producer responsibility.

    (a) Where available, RMA loss records will be used for insured 
crops.
    (b) If RMA loss records are not available, producers are responsible 
for:
    (1) Retaining or providing, when required, the best verifiable or 
reliable production records available for the crop;
    (2) Summarizing all the production evidence;
    (3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, 
whether or not records reflect this production; and
    (4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily 
understood by the county committee.
    (c) In determining production under this section the producer must 
supply acceptable production records to substantiate production to the 
county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of 
through commercial channels, acceptable production records include: 
commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger sheets; or load 
summaries; appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to CCC. 
If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to livestock, or 
disposed of in means other than commercial channels, acceptable 
production records include: truck scale tickets; appraisal information 
from a loss adjuster acceptable to CCC; contemporaneous diaries; or 
other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous measurements.
    (d) Producers must provide all records for any production of a crop 
which is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for 
guaranteed payment. The failure to report the existence of any 
guaranteed contract or similar arrangement or agreement shall be 
considered as providing false information to CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.204  Determination of production.

    (a) Production under this subpart shall include all harvested 
production, unharvested appraised production and assigned production for 
the total planted acreage of the crop on the unit.
    (b) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more 
than once in a crop year shall include the total harvested production 
from all these harvests.
    (c) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested, the actual 
harvested production shall be used to determine benefits.
    (d) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing 
assistance loans with an intended use of grain but harvested as silage, 
ensilage, cobbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be 
adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent according to instructions 
issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (e) For crops with an established yield and market price for 
multiple intended uses, a value will be calculated for each use.
    (f) For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for 
the crop with no established county average yield and market price, 60 
percent, if insured or noninsurable, or 65 percent, if uninsured, of the 
salvage value received will be deducted from the disaster payment.
    (g) If a producer has an arrangement, agreement, or contract for 
guaranteed payment for production (as opposed to production based on 
delivery), the production to count shall be the greater of the actual 
production or the guaranteed payment converted to production according 
to instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (h) Production that is commingled between units before it was a 
matter of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means 
acceptable to CCC shall be prorated to each respective unit according to 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator. Commingled production 
may be attributed to the applicable unit, if the producer made the unit 
production of a commodity a matter of record before

[[Page 717]]

commingling and does any of the following, as applicable:
    (1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production 
of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from 
beyond the unit;
    (2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the county 
committee; or
    (3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner 
acceptable to the county committee.
    (i) The county committee shall assign production for the unit when 
the county committee determines that:
    (1) The producer has failed to provide adequate and acceptable 
production records;
    (2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not 
covered by this subpart, or circumstances other than natural disaster, 
and there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause 
of loss;
    (3) The producer carries out a practice, such as double cropping, 
that generally results in lower yields than the established historic 
yields;
    (4) The producer has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop; or
    (5) A crop is late-planted.
    (j) For sugarcane, the quantity of sugar produced from such crop 
shall exclude acreage harvested for seed.
    (k) For peanuts, the actual production shall be all peanuts 
harvested for nuts regardless of their disposition or use as adjusted 
for low quality.
    (l) For tobacco, except flue-cured and burley, the actual production 
shall be the sum of the tobacco: marketed or available to be marketed; 
destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as determined by 
an appraisal. For flue-cured and burley tobacco, the actual production 
shall be the sum of the tobacco: marketed, regardless of whether the 
tobacco was produced in the current crop year or a prior crop year; on 
hand; destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as 
determined by an appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.205  Calculation of acreage for crop losses other than prevented planted.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the acreage of a crop 
planted in each planting period shall be considered a different crop for 
the purpose of determining disaster benefits under this subpart.
    (b) In cases where there is a repeat crop, double crop or a multiple 
planting, each of these crops may be considered different crops if the 
county committee determines that:
    (1) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted with 
an intent to harvest;
    (2) The subsequent crop was planted after the time when the initial 
crop would normally have been harvested;
    (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted 
within the normal planting period for that crop; and
    (4) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other 
eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices.
    (c) In cases where an initial crop is planted and fails due to an 
eligible disaster condition and it is generally considered too late to 
replant and a subsequent crop is planted on the same acreage within its 
normal planting period in the same crop year and also failed because of 
an eligible disaster condition, both crops are eligible for disaster 
assistance if they meet all other eligibility provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.206  Calculation of prevented planted acreage.

    (a) When determining losses under this subpart, prevented-planted 
acreage will be considered separately from planted acreage of the same 
crop.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for insured 
crops, disaster payments under this subpart for prevented-planted 
acreage shall not be made unless RMA documentation indicates that the 
eligible producer received a prevented planting payment under the RMA-
administered program.
    (c) For insured crops, disaster payments under this subpart for 
prevented-planted acreage will be made available for the following crops 
for which prevented planting coverage was

[[Page 718]]

not available and for which the county committee will make an 
eligibility determination according to paragraph (d) of this section: 
California safflowers; peanuts; peppers; popcorn; Central/Southern 
potatoes; sweet corn (fresh market); tomatoes (fresh market); tomatoes 
(processing).
    (d) For uninsured or noninsurable crops, or the insured crops listed 
in paragraph (c) of this section, the producer must prove, to the 
satisfaction of the county committee, an intent to plant the crop and 
that such crop could not be planted because of an eligible disaster. The 
county committee must be able to determine the producer was prevented 
from planting the crop by an eligible disaster that both:
    (1) Prevented most producers from planting on acreage with similar 
characteristics in the surrounding area; and
    (2) Unless otherwise allowed by the Deputy Administrator, began no 
earlier than the planting season for the 1998 crop.
    (e) Prevented planted disaster benefits under this subpart shall not 
apply to:
    (1) Aquaculture, including ornamental fish; perennial forage crops 
grown for hay, seed, or grazing; ginseng root and ginseng seed; honey; 
maple sap; millet; nursery crops; sweet potatoes; tobacco; trees; 
turfgrass sod; and tree and vine crops;
    (2) Any acreage which is double-cropped, even if the producer has a 
history of double-cropping acreage;
    (3) Uninsured crop acreage that is unclassified for insurance 
purposes;
    (4) Acreage that is used for conservation purposes or intended to be 
left unplanted under any USDA program;
    (5) The same acreage from which any benefit is derived under any 
program administered by the USDA on which a crop is planted and fails 
during the crop year except as provided in 1477.106(f) of this part;
    (6) Any acreage on which a crop other than a cover crop was 
harvested, hayed, or grazed during the crop year;
    (7) Any acreage for which a cash lease payment is received for the 
use of the acreage the same crop year unless the county committee 
determines the lease was for haying and grazing rights only and was not 
a lease for use of the land;
    (8) Acreage for which planting history or conservation plans 
indicate that the acreage would have remained fallow for crop rotation 
purposes;
    (9) Acreage for which the producer or any other person received a 
prevented planted payment for any crop for the same acreage, excluding 
share arrangements; and
    (10) Acreage for which the producer cannot provide proof to the 
county committee that inputs such as seed, chemicals, and fertilizer 
were available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of at 
least producing a normal yield.
    (f) Disaster benefits under this subpart shall not apply to acreage 
where the prevented-planted acreage was affected by a disaster that was 
caused by drought or the failure of the irrigation water supply unless 
the acreage is in an area classified by the Palmer Drought Severity 
Index as in a severe or extreme drought during the time period specified 
by the producer.
    (g) For uninsured or noninsurable crops and the insured crops listed 
in paragraph (c) of this section, for prevented planting purposes:
    (1) The maximum prevented-planted acreage for all crops:
    (i) Cannot exceed the number of acres of cropland in the unit for 
the crop year; and
    (ii) Will be reduced by the number of acres planted in the unit;
    (2) The maximum prevented planted acreage for a crop cannot exceed 
the number of acres planted by the producer, or which was prevented from 
planting, to the crop in any 1 of the 1994 through 1997 crop years as 
determined by the county committee;
    (3) For crops grown under a contract specifying the number of acres 
contracted, the prevented-planted acreage is limited to the result of 
the number of acres specified in the contract minus planted acreage;
    (4) For each crop type or variety for which separate prices or 
yields are sought for prevented-planted acreage, the producer must 
provide evidence that the claimed prevented-planted acres were 
successfully planted in at

[[Page 719]]

least 1 of the most recent 4 crop years; and
    (5) The prevented planted acreage must be one contiguous block 
consisting of at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the intended planted 
acreage in the unit, whichever is less.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.207  Quality adjustments to production.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the quantity of 
production of crops that were damaged due to disaster resulting in 
diminished quality, shall be adjusted by the county committee in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) Crops eligible for quality adjustments to production are limited 
to:
    (1) Barley; canola; corn; cotton; flaxseed; grain sorghum; mustard 
seed; oats; peanuts; rapeseed; rice; safflower; soybeans; sugar beets; 
sunflower-oil; sunflower-seed; tobacco; wheat; and
    (2) Crops with multiple market uses such as fresh, processed or 
juice, as supported by NASS data or other data determined acceptable in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator. RMA 
loss production figures will not be used to conduct this quality 
adjustment unless the Deputy Administrator determines otherwise.
    (c) The producer must submit documentation for determining the grade 
and other discount factors that were applied to the crop.
    (d) Quality adjustments will be applied after production has been 
adjusted to standard moisture, when applicable.
    (e) Except for cotton, if a quality adjustment has been made for 
multi-peril crop insurance purposes, an additional adjustment will not 
be made.
    (f) Quality adjustments for crops, other than cotton, peanuts, sugar 
beets and tobacco, listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be 
made by applying an adjustment factor based on dividing the Federal 
marketing assistance loan rate applicable to the crop and producer 
determined according to part 1421 of this chapter by the unadjusted 
county marketing assistance loan rate for the crop. For crops that grade 
sample and are marketed through normal channels, production will be 
adjusted according to instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator. 
County committees may, with state committee concurrence, establish 
county average quality adjustment factors according to procedures issued 
by the Deputy Administrator.
    (g) Quality adjustments for cotton shall be based on the difference 
between:
    (1) The loan rate applicable to the crop and producer determined 
according to part 1427 of this chapter; and
    (2) The adjusted county loan rate. The adjusted county rate is the 
county loan rate adjusted for the 4-year county average historical 
quality premium or discount, in accordance with instructions issued by 
the Deputy Administrator.
    (h) Quality adjustments for quota peanuts shall for unused quota be 
based on the difference between the adjusted sales price and the quota 
price. The adjusted sales price is the quota price minus discounts for 
quality, regardless of the actual sales price received. Adjustments for 
other peanuts may be made as determined appropriate by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (i) Quality adjustments for sugar beets shall be based on sugar 
content. The 1998 actual production for the producer shall be adjusted 
upward or downward to account for sugar content according to 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (j) Quality adjustments for tobacco shall be based on the difference 
between the sales price and the support price.
    (k) Quality adjustments for crops with multiple market uses such as 
fresh, processed and juice, shall be applied based on the difference 
between the producer's historical marketing percentage of each market 
use compared to the actual percentage for 1998, as determined in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (l) Quality adjustments for aflatoxin shall be based on the 
aflatoxin level. The producer must provide the County Office with proof 
a price reduction because of aflatoxin. The aflatoxin level must be 20 
parts per billion or more before a quality adjustment will be made. The 
quality adjustment factor applied

[[Page 720]]

to affected production is .50 if the production is marketable. If the 
production is unmarketable due to aflatoxin levels of at least 20 parts 
per billion, production will be adjusted to zero. Any value received 
will be considered salvage.
    (m) Any quantity of the crop determined to be salvage will not be 
considered production. Salvage values shall be factored by .60 for 
insured and noninsurable commodities and .65 for uninsured commodities.
    (n) Quality adjustments do not apply to value loss crops.
    (o) Quality adjustments shall not apply to: hay, honey, maple sap, 
turfgrass sod, crops marketed for a use other than an intended use for 
which there is not an established county price or yield.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.208   1999 crop losses.

    (a) Producers have the option to receive benefits on 1999 crop 
rather than 1998 loss when both the following apply:
    (1) The 1999 crop was affected by disaster-related conditions that 
occurred in calendar year 1998; and
    (2) Harvest for the 1999 crop would normally begin in calendar year 
1998.
    (b) Producers may elect to use the 1999 crop for 1998 single-year 
CLDAP benefits only.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.209  Value loss crops.

    (a) Special provisions to assess losses and calculate disaster 
assistance under this subpart apply to the following crops and such 
other crops as may be identified in instructions issued by the Deputy 
Administrator: ornamental nursery; Christmas trees; ginseng root; and 
aquaculture, including ornamental fish.
    (b) Disaster benefits under this subpart are calculated based on the 
loss of value at the time of disaster, as provided by instructions 
issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) For aquaculture, disaster benefits under this subpart for 
aquacultural species are limited to those aquacultural species which 
were placed in the aquacultural facility by the producer. Disaster 
benefits under this subpart shall not be made available for aquacultural 
species that are growing naturally in the aquaculture facility. Disaster 
benefits under this subpart are limited to aquacultural species that 
were planted or seeded on property owned or leased by the producer where 
that land has readily identifiable boundaries, and over which the 
producer has total control of the waterbed and the ground under the 
waterbed. Producers who only have control over a column of water will 
not be eligible for disaster benefits under this subpart.
    (d) For ornamental nursery crops, disaster benefits under this 
subpart are limited to ornamental nursery crops that were grown in a 
container or controlled environment for commercial sale on property 
owned or leased by the producer, and cared for and managed using good 
nursery growing practices. Indigenous crops are not eligible for 
benefits under this subpart.
    (e) For Christmas trees, disaster benefits under this subpart are 
limited to losses which exceed 35 percent of the value of the Christmas 
trees present at the time of the disaster. Christmas tree producers 
seeking disaster assistance under this subpart must provide acreage 
data, dates of plantings and the quantity of trees planted on each date.


<R05>
Sec. 1477.210  Other specialty crops.

    (a) Other special provisions to assess losses and calculate disaster 
assistance under this subpart apply to the following crops and such 
other crops as may be identified in instructions issued by the Deputy 
Administrator: turfgrass sod, honey and maple sap.
    (b) For turfgrass sod, disaster benefits under this subpart are 
limited to turfgrass sod which would have matured and been harvested 
during 1998, when a disaster caused in excess of 35 percent of the 
expected production to die.
    (c) For honey, disaster benefits under this subpart are limited to 
table and nontable honey produced commercially for human consumption. 
For calculating benefits, all honey is considered a single crop, 
regardless of type or variety of floral source or intended use.
    (d) For maple sap, disaster benefits under this subpart are limited 
to maple sap produced on private property in a controlled environment by 
a commercial operator for sale as sap or syrup.

[[Page 721]]

The maple sap must be produced from trees that are: located on land the 
producer controls by ownership or lease; managed for production of maple 
sap; and are at least 30 years old and 12 inches in diameter.


<R04>
       Subpart C--Multi-Year Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program


<R05>
Sec. 1477.300  Multi-year crop losses.

    (a) The disaster benefits under this subpart, the 1998 Crop Loss 
Disaster Assistance Program Multi-year Losses, will be equal to 25 
percent of the producer's previous loss payments for the qualifying 
losses if the producer received:
    (1) Crop insurance indemnity payments for crop losses on insured 
crops under the RMA-administered program, excluding replanting or raisin 
reconditioning payments; or
    (2) Payments from the Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program 
for multi-year crop losses, including any 1994 ad hoc disaster payment 
of a noninsurable crop.
    (b) In order to receive benefits under this subpart, the producer 
must have received (a)(1) or (a)(2) in at least 3 of the 5 crop years 
running from 1994 through 1998 and only such losses shall be considered 
qualifying losses for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) For multi-year eligibility based on crop insurance indemnity 
payments, RMA will determine the producers that meet the eligibility 
requirements along with indemnity amounts and pass the data to FSA.
    (d) For NAP multi-year eligibility, FSA will determine eligible 
producers. Because the multi-year payments are based on payments 
previously received, area loss provisions apply.
    (e) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the ``Federal 
loss payments'' shall only be those payments which were received for 
qualifying losses under the programs identified in paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section. In addition, benefits under this part will be 
permitted only where the qualifying losses were suffered by the 
identical producers, as determined under instructions of the Deputy 
Administrator. Changes in the organization and control of entities or 
production units will be considered to be changes in producers for crop 
history purposes. Likewise, in joint ventures, the entity will be 
considered to be the producer, not the individual members, and 
representational entities, such as a trust, will be considered different 
producers than the beneficiaries of the entity, except as otherwise 
allowed by the Deputy Administrator. The provisions of this subsection 
shall be used for qualifying purposes only for multi-year benefits and 
shall not, for qualified recipients, affect other restrictions that 
limit the maximum payment amount that may be received under this 
program.

crop in 1999 for which the producer receives crop loss assistance under 
this part must purchase crop insurance on that crop for the 2000 and 
2001 crop years.
    (b) If, at the time the producer is advised that he or she is 
eligible for crop loss assistance under this part, and the sales closing 
date for the 2000 crop year has passed for any crop for which crop 
insurance is required as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
producer must purchase crop insurance for the 2001 crop year for any 
such crop.
    (c) If any producer fails to purchase crop insurance as required in 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the producer will be required to 
refund the benefits received or pay a lesser amount as may be specified 
by the Deputy Administrator.

Sec. 1478.8  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Disaster benefits under this part are not subject to 
administrative offset under Sec. 1403.8 of this chapter except as 
determined appropriate by the Deputy Administrator who may, among other 
offsets, deduct from the benefits accrued any reductions appropriate for 
a producer's failure to obtain crop insurance as required in connection 
with benefits for crop losses in prior years.
    (b) A person shall be ineligible to receive disaster assistance 
under this part if it is determined by the State or county committee or 
an official of FSA that such person has:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the 
purpose of a program operated under this part;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation with respect to such program; 
or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (c) In the event there is a failure to comply with any term,

shall be refunded to CCC, together with interest as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and late-payment charges 
as provided for in part 1403 of this chapter.
    (d) Producers shall be required to pay interest on any refund 
required of the producer receiving assistance or a payment if CCC 
determines that payments or other assistance were provided to the 
producer and the producer was not eligible for such assistance. The 
interest rate shall be one percent greater than the rate of interest 
that the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date of 
payment. Interest that is determined to be due CCC shall accrue from the 
date such benefits were made available by CCC to the date repayment is 
completed. CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC determines that 
the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any error by the 
producer.
    (e) All persons with a financial interest in the operation receiving 
benefits under this part shall be jointly and severally liable for any 
refund, including related charges, which is determined to be due CCC for 
any reason under this part.
    (f) In the event that any request for assistance or payment under 
this part was established as result of erroneous information or a 
miscalculation, the assistance or payment shall be recalculated and any 
excess refunded with applicable interest.
    (g) The liability of any person for any penalty under this part or 
for any refund to CCC or related charge arising in connection therewith 
shall be in addition to any other liability of such person under any 
civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law including,

<R05>
Sec. 1478.9  Matters of general applicability.

    (a) For calculations of loss made with respect to insured crops, the 
producer's existing unit structure will be used as the basis for the 
calculation and may include optional units established in accordance 
with part 457 of this title. For uninsured and noninsurable crops, basic 
units will be established for these purposes.
    (b) Loss payment rates and factors shall be established by the state 
committee based on procedures provided by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) County average yield for loss calculations will be the simple 
average of the 1993 through 1997 official county yields established by 
FSA.
    (d) County committees will assign production when the county 
committee determines:
    (1) An acceptable appraisal or record of harvested production does 
not exist;
    (2) The loss is due to an ineligible cause of loss or practices that 
cause lower yields than those upon which the historic yield is based;
    (3) The producer has a contract providing a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop; or
    (4) The crop is planted beyond the normal planting period for the 
crop.
    (e) The county committee shall establish a maximum loss level based 
on other losses in the county for the same crop. The maximum loss level 
for the county shall be expressed as either a percent of loss or yield 
per acre. The maximum loss level will apply when:
    (1) Unharvested acreage has not been appraised by FSA, RMA, a 
company reinsured by FCIC, or other appraiser;
    (2) The crop's loss is because of an ineligible disaster condition 
or circumstances other than a natural disaster;
    (3) Acceptable production records for harvested acres are not 
available from any source; or
    (4) Any other good reason for such a limit shall present itself.
    (f) Assigned production for practices that result in lower yields 
than those for which the historic yield is based shall be established 
based on the acres found to have been subjected to those practices.
    (g) Assigned production for crops planted beyond the normal planting 
period for the crop shall be calculated according to the lateness of 
planting the crop. If the crop is planted after the final planting date 
by:
    (1) 1 through 10 calendar days, the assigned production reduction 
will be based on one percent of the payment yield for each day involved.
    (2) 11 through 24 calendar days, the assigned production reduction 
will be based on 10 percent of the payment yield plus an additional two 
percent reduction of the payment yield for each days of days 11 through 
24 that are involved.
    (3) 25 or more calendar days or a date from which the crop would not 
reasonably be expected to mature by harvest, the assigned production 
reduction will be based on 50 percent of the payment yield or such 
greater amount determined by the county committee to be appropriate.
    (h) Assigned production for producers with contracts to receive a 
guaranteed payment for production of an eligible crop will be 
established by the county committee by:
    (1) Determining the total amount of guaranteed payment for the unit;

[[Page 729]]

    (2) Converting the guaranteed payment to guaranteed production by 
dividing the total amount of guaranteed payment by the approved county 
price for the crop or variety or such other factor deemed appropriate if 
otherwise the production would appear to be too high; and
    (3) Establishing the production for the unit as the greater of the 
actual net production for the unit or the guaranteed payment.

Sec. 1478.10  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1478.11  Qualifying 1999 crop losses.

    (a) To receive disaster benefits under this part, which covers 
single-year 1999 crop losses, the county committee must determine that 
because of a disaster, the producer with respect to the 1999 crop year:
    (1) Was prevented from planting a crop;
    (2) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the expected 
production of a crop;
    (3) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the value for value 
loss crops; or
    (4) Sustained damage in excess of 20 percent of an individual stand 
of eligible trees.
    (b) Calculation of benefits under this part shall not include 
losses:
    (1) That are the result of poor management decisions or poor farming 
practices as determined by the county committee on a case-by-case basis;
    (2) That are the result of the failure of the producer to reseed or 
replant to the same crop in the county where it is customary to reseed 
or replant after a loss;
    (3) That are not as a result of a natural disaster;
    (4) To crops not intended for harvest in crop year 1999;
    (5) To losses of by-products resulting from processing or harvesting 
a crop, such as cotton seed, peanut shells, wheat or oat straw;
    (6) To home gardens;
    (7) That are a result of water contained or released by any 
governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project if an easement 
exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of the 
water; or
    (8) To losses of trees that are a result of normal mortality or 
would have been lost to normal mortality but for the disaster.
    (c) Calculation of benefits under this part for ornamental nursery 
stock shall not include losses:
    (1) Caused by a failure of power supply or brownouts;
    (2) Caused by the inability to market nursery stock as a result of 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;
    (3) Caused by fire;
    (4) Affecting crops where weeds and other forms of undergrowth in 
the vicinity of the nursery stock have not been controlled; or
    (5) Caused by the collapse or failure of buildings or structures.
    (d) Calculation of benefits under this part for honey where the 
honey production by colonies or bees was diminished, shall not include 
losses:
    (1) Where the inability to extract was due to the unavailability of 
equipment; the collapse or failure of equipment or apparatus used in the 
honey operation;
    (2) Resulting from improper storage of honey;
    (3) To honey production because of bee feeding;
    (4) Caused by the application of chemicals;
    (5) Caused by theft, fire, or vandalism;
    (6) Caused by the movement of bees by the producer or any other 
person; or
    (7) Due to disease or pest infestation of the colonies.


<R05>
Sec. 1478.12  Calculating rates and yields.

    (a) Payment rates for 1999 year crop losses shall be:
    (1) 65 percent of the maximum established RMA price for insured 
crops;
    (2) 65 percent of the State average price for noninsurable crops;
    (3) 60 percent of the maximum established RMA price for uninsured 
crops; and
    (4) 65 percent of the established practice rate for damage to 
eligible trees.
    (b) Disaster benefits under this part for losses to crops other than 
trees shall be made in an amount determined by multiplying the loss of 
production in excess of 35 percent of the expected production by the 
applicable payment

[[Page 730]]

rate established according to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Disaster benefits under this part for losses of trees shall be 
made in an amount determined by multiplying the quantity of acres or 
number of trees in a practice approved by the county committee as 
authorized by the Deputy Administrator, by the payment rate established 
according to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Separate payment rates and yields for the same crop may be 
established by the county committee as authorized by the Deputy 
Administrator, when there is supporting data from NASS or other sources 
approved by CCC that show there is a significant difference in yield or 
value based on a distinct and separate end use of the crop. In spite of 
differences in yield or values, separate rates or yields shall not be 
established for crops with different cultural practices, such as 
organically or hydroponically grown.
    (e) Each eligible producer's share of a disaster payment shall be 
based on the producer's share of the crop or crop proceeds, or, if no 
crop was produced, the share the producer would have received if the 
crop had been produced. In cases where crop insurance provides for a 
landlord/tenant to insure the tenant/landlord's share according to part 
457 of this title, disaster payments will be issued on the same basis.
    (f) When calculating a payment for a unit loss:
    (1) The unharvested payment factor shall be applied to crop acreage 
planted but not harvested; and
    (2) The prevented planting factor shall be applied to any prevented 
planted acreage eligible for payment.
    (g) Production from all end uses of a multi-use crop or all 
secondary uses for multiple market crops will be calculated separately 
and summarized together.


<R05>
Sec. 1478.13  Production losses, producer responsibility.

    (a) Where available, RMA loss records will be used for insured 
crops.
    (b) If RMA loss records are not available, producers are responsible 
for:
    (1) Retaining or providing, when required, the best verifiable or 
reliable production records available for the crop;
    (2) Summarizing all the production evidence;
    (3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, 
whether or not records reflect this production; and
    (4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily 
understood by the county committee.
    (c) In determining production under this section the producer must 
supply acceptable production records to substantiate production to the 
county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of 
through commercial channels, acceptable production records include: 
commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger sheets; or load 
summaries; appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to CCC. 
If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to livestock, or 
disposed of in means other than commercial channels, acceptable 
production records include: truck scale tickets; appraisal information 
from a loss adjuster acceptable to CCC; contemporaneous diaries; or 
other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous measurements.
    (d) Producers must provide all records for any production of a crop 
that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed 
payment. The failure to report the existence of any guaranteed contract 
or similar arrangement or agreement shall be considered as providing 
false information to CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1478.14  Determination of production.

    (a) Production under this part shall include all harvested 
production, unharvested appraised production and assigned production for 
the total planted acreage of the crop on the unit.
    (b) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more 
than once in a crop year shall include the total harvested production 
from all these harvests.
    (c) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested, the actual 
harvested production shall be used to determine benefits.

[[Page 731]]

    (d) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing 
assistance loans with an intended use of grain but harvested as silage, 
ensilage, cobbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be 
adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent as established by CCC.
    (e) For crops with an established yield and market price for 
multiple intended uses, a value will be calculated for each use; with
    (1) The intended use or uses for disaster purposes based on 
historical production and acreage evidence provided by the producer; and
    (2) The eligible acres for each use and the calculation of the 
disaster payment will be determined by the county committee according to 
instruction issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (f) For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for 
the crop with no established county average yield and market price, 60 
percent of the salvage value received will be deducted from the disaster 
payment.
    (g) If a producer has an arrangement, agreement, or contract for 
guaranteed payment for production (as opposed to production based on 
delivery), the production to count shall be the greater of the actual 
production or the guaranteed payment converted to production as 
determined by CCC.
    (h) Production that is commingled between units before it was a 
matter of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means 
acceptable to CCC shall be prorated to each respective by CCC. 
Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable unit, if the 
producer made the unit production of a commodity a matter of record 
before commingling and does any of the following, as applicable:
    (1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production 
of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from 
beyond the unit;
    (2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the county 
committee; or
    (3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner 
acceptable to the county committee.
    (i) The county committee shall assign production for the unit when 
the county committee determines that:
    (1) The producer has failed to provide adequate and acceptable 
production records;
    (2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not 
covered by this part, or circumstances other than natural disaster, and 
there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause of 
loss;
    (3) The producer carries out a practice, such as double cropping, 
that generally results in lower yields than the established historic 
yields;
    (4) The producer has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop; or
    (5) A crop is late-planted.
    (j) For sugarcane, the quantity of sugar produced from such crop 
shall exclude acreage harvested for seed.
    (k) For peanuts, the actual production shall be all peanuts 
harvested for nuts regardless of their disposition or use as adjusted 
for low quality.
    (l) For tobacco, except flue-cured and burley, the actual production 
shall be the sum of the tobacco: marketed or available to be marketed; 
destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as determined by 
an appraisal. For flue-cured and burley tobacco, the actual production 
shall be the sum of the tobacco: marketed, regardless of whether the 
tobacco was produced in the current crop year or a prior crop year; on 
hand; destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as 
determined by an appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 1478.15  Calculation of acreage for crop losses other than prevented planted.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the acreage of a crop 
planted in each planting period shall be considered a different crop for 
the purpose of determining disaster benefits under this part.
    (b) In cases where there is a repeat crop, double crop or a multiple 
planting, each of these crops may be considered different crops if the 
county committee determines that:

[[Page 732]]

    (1) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted with 
an intent to harvest;
    (2) The subsequent crop was planted after the time when the initial 
crop would normally have been harvested;
    (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted 
within the normal planting period for that crop; and
    (4) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other 
eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices.
    (c) In cases where an initial crop is planted and fails due to an 
eligible disaster condition and it is generally considered too late to 
replant and a subsequent crop is planted on the same acreage within its 
normal planting period in the same crop year and also failed because of 
an eligible disaster condition, both crops are eligible for disaster 
assistance if they meet all other eligibility provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1478.16  Calculation of prevented planted acreage.

    (a) When determining losses under this part, prevented-planted 
acreage will be considered separately from planted acreage of the same 
crop.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for insured 
crops, disaster payments under this part for prevented-planted acreage 
shall not be made unless RMA documentation indicates that the eligible 
producer received a prevented planting payment under the RMA-
administered program.
    (c) For insured crops, disaster payments under this part for 
prevented-planted acreage will be made available for the following crops 
for which prevented planting coverage was not available and for which 
the county committee will make an eligibility determination according to 
paragraph (d) of this section: peppers; sweet corn (fresh market); 
tomatoes (fresh market); tomatoes (processing).
    (d) For uninsured or noninsurable crops, or the insured crops listed 
in paragraph (c) of this section, the producer must prove, to the 
satisfaction of the county committee, an intent to plant the crop and 
that such crop could not be planted because of an eligible disaster. The 
county committee must be able to determine the producer was prevented 
from planting the crop by an eligible disaster that both:
    (1) Prevented most producers from planting on acreage with similar 
characteristics in the surrounding area; and
    (2) Unless otherwise approved by the Deputy Administrator, began no 
earlier than the planting season for the 1999 crop.
    (e) Prevented planted disaster benefits under this part shall not 
apply to:
    (1) Aquaculture, including ornamental fish; perennial forage crops 
grown for hay, seed, or grazing; ginseng root and ginseng seed; honey; 
maple sap; millet; nursery crops; sweet potatoes; tobacco; trees; 
turfgrass sod; and tree and vine crops;
    (2) Any acreage that is double-cropped, even if the producer has a 
history of double-cropping acreage;
    (3) Uninsured crop acreage that is unclassified for insurance 
purposes;
    (4) Acreage that is used for conservation purposes or intended to be 
left unplanted under any USDA program;
    (5) The same acreage from which any benefit is derived under any 
program administered by the USDA on which a crop is planted and fails 
during the crop year except as provided in Sec. 1478.6(f);
    (6) Any acreage on which a crop other than a cover crop was 
harvested, hayed, or grazed during the crop year;
    (7) Any acreage for which a cash lease payment is received for the 
use of the acreage the same crop year unless the county committee 
determines the lease was for haying and grazing rights only and was not 
a lease for use of the land;
    (8) Acreage for which planting history or conservation plans 
indicate that the acreage would have remained fallow for crop rotation 
purposes;
    (9) Acreage for which the producer or any other person received a 
prevented planted payment for any crop for the same acreage, excluding 
share arrangements; and
    (10) Acreage for which the producer cannot provide proof to the 
county committee that inputs such as seed, chemicals, and fertilizer 
were available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of at 
least producing a normal yield.

[[Page 733]]

    (f) Disaster benefits under this part shall not apply to uninsured 
and noninsurable crops where the prevented-planted acreage was affected 
by a disaster that was caused by drought or the failure of the 
irrigation water supply unless the acreage is in an area classified by 
the Palmer Drought Severity Index as in a severe or extreme drought 
during the planting period time specified by the producer and prior to 
the final planting date for the crop.
    (g) For uninsured or noninsurable crops and the insured crops listed 
in paragraph (c) of this section, for prevented planting purposes:
    (1) The maximum prevented-planted acreage for all crops:
    (i) Cannot exceed the number of acres of cropland in the unit for 
the crop year; and
    (ii) Will be reduced by the number of acres planted in the unit;
    (2) The maximum prevented planted acreage for a crop cannot exceed 
the number of acres planted by the producer, or that was prevented from 
being planted, to the crop in any 1 of the 1995 through 1998 crop years 
as determined by the county committee;
    (3) For crops grown under a contract specifying the number of acres 
contracted, the prevented-planted acreage is limited to the result of 
the number of acres specified in the contract minus planted acreage;
    (4) For each crop type or variety for which separate prices or 
yields are sought for prevented-planted acreage, the producer must 
provide evidence that the claimed prevented-planted acres were 
successfully planted in at least 1 of the most recent 4 crop years; and
    (5) The prevented planted acreage must be one contiguous block 
consisting of at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the intended planted 
acreage in the unit, whichever is less.


<R05>
Sec. 1478.17  Quality adjustments to production.

    (a) For the crops identified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
subject to the provisions of this section and part, the quantity of 
production of crops of the producer shall be adjusted to reflect 
diminished quality resulting from the disaster.
    (b) Crops eligible for quality adjustments to production are limited 
to:
    (1) Barley; canola; corn; cotton; crambe , flaxseed; grain sorghum; 
mustard seed; oats; peanuts; rapeseed; rice; safflower; soybeans; sugar 
beets; sunflower-oil; sunflower-seed; tobacco; wheat; and
    (2) Crops with multiple market uses such as fresh, processed or 
juice, as supported by NASS data or other data determined acceptable.
    (c) The producer must submit documentation for determining the grade 
and other discount factors that were applied to the crop.
    (d) Quality adjustments will be applied after production has been 
adjusted to standard moisture, when applicable.
    (e) Except for cotton, if a quality adjustment has been made for 
multi-peril crop insurance purposes, an additional adjustment will not 
be made.
    (f) Quality adjustments for crops, other than cotton, peanuts, sugar 
beets and tobacco, listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be 
made by applying an adjustment factor based on dividing the Federal 
marketing assistance loan rate applicable to the crop and producer 
determined according to part 1421 of this chapter by the unadjusted 
county marketing assistance loan rate for the crop. For crops that grade 
``sample'' and are marketed through normal channels, production will be 
adjusted as determined by CCC. County committees may, with state 
committee concurrence, establish county average quality adjustment 
factors.
    (g) Quality adjustments for cotton shall be based on the difference 
between:
    (1) The loan rate applicable to the crop and producer determined 
according to part 1427 of this chapter; and
    (2) The adjusted county loan rate. The adjusted county rate is the 
county loan rate adjusted for the 5-year county average historical 
quality premium or discount, as determined by CCC.
    (h) Quality adjustments for quota peanuts shall for unused quota be 
based on the difference between the adjusted

[[Page 734]]

sales price and the quota price. The adjusted sales price is the quota 
price minus discounts for quality, regardless of the actual sales price 
received. Adjustments for non-quota peanuts may also be made to reflect 
diminished quality as determined by CCC.
    (i) Quality adjustments for sugar beets shall be based on sugar 
content. The 1999 actual production for the producer shall be adjusted 
upward or downward to account for sugar content as determined by CCC.
    (j) Quality adjustments for tobacco shall be based on the difference 
between the sales price and the support price except that the market 
price may be used instead of the support price where market prices for 
the tobacco are normally in excess of the support price.
    (k) Quality adjustments for crops with multiple market uses such as 
fresh, processed and juice, shall be applied based on the difference 
between the producer's historical marketing percentage of each market 
use compared to the actual percentage for 1999.
    (l) Quality adjustments for aflatoxin shall be based on the 
aflatoxin level. The producer must provide the county committee with 
proof a price reduction because of aflatoxin. The aflatoxin level must 
be 20 parts per billion or more before a quality adjustment will be 
made. The quality adjustment factor applied to affected production is 
.50 if the production is marketable. If the production is unmarketable 
due to aflatoxin levels of at least 20 parts per billion, production 
will be adjusted to zero. Any value received will be considered salvage.
    (m) Any quantity of the crop determined to be salvage will not be 
considered production. Salvage values shall be factored by 0.60.
    (n) Quality adjustments do not apply to value loss crops.
    (o) Quality adjustments shall not apply to: hay, honey, maple sap, 
turfgrass sod, crops marketed for a use other than an intended use for 
which there is not an established county price or yield.


<R05>
Sec. 1478.18  Value loss crops.

    (a) Special provisions to assess losses and calculate disaster 
assistance under this part apply to the following crops and such other 
crops as determined by CCC: ornamental nursery; Christmas trees; 
vegetable and root stock including ginseng root; and aquaculture, 
including ornamental fish.
    (b) Disaster benefits under this part are calculated based on the 
loss of value at the time of disaster, as determined by CCC.
    (c) For aquaculture, disaster benefits under this part for 
aquacultural species are limited to those aquacultural species that were 
placed in the aquacultural facility by the producer. Disaster benefits 
under this part shall not be made available for aquacultural species 
that are growing naturally in the aquaculture facility. Disaster 
benefits under this part are limited to aquacultural species that were 
planted or seeded on property owned or leased by the producer where that 
land has readily identifiable boundaries, and over which the producer 
has total control of the waterbed and the ground under the waterbed. 
Producers who only have control over a column of water will not be 
eligible for disaster benefits under this part.
    (d) For ornamental nursery crops, disaster benefits under this part 
are limited to ornamental nursery crops that were grown in a container 
or controlled environment for commercial sale on property owned or 
leased by the producer, and cared for and managed using good nursery 
growing practices. Indigenous crops are not eligible for benefits under 
this part.
    (e) For Christmas trees, disaster benefits under this part are 
limited to losses that exceed 35 percent of the value of the Christmas 
trees present at the time of the disaster. Christmas tree producers 
seeking disaster assistance under this part must provide acreage data, 
dates of plantings and the quantity of trees planted on each date.
    (f) For vegetable and root stock, disaster benefits under this part 
are limited to plants grown in a container or controlled environment for 
use as transplants or root stock by the producer for commercial sale or 
property owned or leased by the producer and managed using good 
rootstock or fruit and vegetable plant growing practices.

<R05>
Sec. 1478.19  Other specialty crops.

    (a) For turfgrass sod, disaster benefits under this subpart are 
limited to turfgrass sod that would have matured and been harvested 
during 1999, when a disaster caused in excess of 35 percent of the 
expected production to die.
    (b) For honey, disaster benefits under this part are limited to 
table and non-table honey produced commercially for human consumption. 
For calculating benefits, all honey is considered a single crop, 
regardless of type or variety of floral source or intended use.
    (c) For maple sap, disaster benefits under this part are limited to 
maple sap produced on private property in a controlled environment by a 
commercial operator for sale as sap or syrup. The maple sap must be 
produced from trees that are: located on land the producer controls by 
ownership or lease; managed for production of maple sap; and are at 
least 30 years old and 12 inches in diameter.

Sec. 1479.5  County committee determinations of general applicability.

    (a) County committees shall determine whether land that is the 
subject of the application is land that has suffered flood-related 
production losses during calendar year 1999, and is at the same time 
land to which the following apply:
    (1) It is land that otherwise would have been used for crops or for 
pasture and could not be used because it was inaccessible, incapable of 
production, or the production was unusable during CY 1999, due to

    (c) The Deputy Administrator may divide and classify crops based on 
loss susceptibility, yield, and other factors.
    (d) No person shall receive more than a total of $80,000 in disaster 
benefits under this part, unless otherwise specified.

[[Page 743]]

    (e) No person shall receive disaster benefits under this part in an 
amount that exceeds the value of the expected production for the 
relevant period as determined by CCC.
    (f) A person who has a gross revenue in excess of $2.5 million for 
the preceding tax year shall not be eligible to receive disaster 
benefits under this part. Gross revenue includes the total income and 
total gross receipts of the person, before any reductions. Gross revenue 
shall not be adjusted, amended, discounted, netted or modified for any 
reason. No deductions for costs, expenses, or pass through funds will be 
deducted from any calculation of gross revenue. For purposes of making 
this determination, gross revenue means the total gross receipts 
received from farming, ranching and forestry operations if the person 
receives more than 50 percent of such person's gross income from farming 
or ranching; or the total gross receipts received from all sources if 
the person receives 50 percent or less of such person's gross receipts 
from farming, ranching and forestry.

Sec. 1480.7  Requirement to purchase crop insurance.

    (a) Except as provided further in this section, any producer who 
elected not to purchase crop insurance on an insurable 2000 crop for 
which the producer receives crop loss assistance under this part must 
purchase crop insurance on that crop for the 2001 and 2002 crop years.
    (b) If, at the time the producer applies for the 2000 CDP the sales 
closing date for 2001 insurable crops for which the producer sought 
benefits under the 2000 CDP has passed, the producer must purchase crop 
insurance for the 2002 crop, but is excused from purchasing insurance 
for those 2001 crops.
    (c) If any producer fails to purchase crop insurance as required in 
paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the producer will be required to 
refund all 2000 CDP benefits received, or such lesser amount as 
determined appropriate to the circumstances by the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.8  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Disaster benefits under this part are not subject to 
administrative offset provided for in section 842 of the 2001 Act 
(Public Law 106-387, 114 Stat. 1549).
    (b) A person shall be ineligible to receive disaster assistance 
under this part if it is determined by the State or county committee or 
an official of FSA that such person has:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the 
purpose of a program operated under this part;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation with respect to such program; 
or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

U.S.C. 714m; and 31 U.S.C. 3729.
    (f) Any person who is dissatisfied with a determination made with 
respect to this part may make a request for reconsideration or appeal of 
such determination in accordance with the regulations set forth at parts 
11 and 780 of this title.
    (g) Any payment or portion thereof to any person shall be made 
without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard 
to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof.
    (h) For the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 3201(e), the Secretary hereby 
waives the restriction on receipt of funds or benefits under this 
program but only as to beneficiaries who as a condition of

[[Page 744]]

such waiver agree to apply the 2000 CDP benefits to reduce the amount of 
the judgment lien.
    (i) The 2000 CDP is carried out using the funds, facilities and 
authorities of the CCC. As with all CCC programs, all authorities 
applicable to CCC and its activities apply to this program including, 
but not limited to the following: assessment of interest for refunds due 
CCC; late payment interest under part 1403 of this chapter; and 
withholding authorities. Additionally, producers may utilize other CCC 
authorities including but not limited to: assignments; and power of 
attorney forms.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.9  Matters of general applicability.

    (a) For calculations of loss made with respect to insured crops, the 
producer's existing unit structure will be used as the basis for the 
calculation and may include optional units established in accordance 
with part 457 of this title. Insured crops may have basic units 
established if the existing unit structure is based on enterprise units 
or whole county units. For uninsured and noninsurable crops, basic units 
will be established for these purposes.
    (b) Loss payment rates and factors shall be established by the state 
committee based on procedures provided by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) County average yield for loss calculations will be the simple 
average of the 1993 through 1997 official county yields established by 
FSA.
    (d) County committees will assign production when the county 
committee determines:
    (1) An acceptable appraisal or record of harvested production does 
not exist;
    (2) The loss is due to an ineligible cause of loss or practices that 
cause lower yields than those upon which the historic yield is based;
    (3) The producer has a contract providing a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop; or
    (4) The crop is planted beyond the normal planting period for the 
crop.
    (e) The county committee shall establish a maximum loss level that 
should reflect the amount of production producers should have 
considering the eligible disaster conditions in the area or county for 
the same crop. The maximum loss level for the county shall be expressed 
as either a percent of loss or yield per acre. The maximum loss level 
will apply when:
    (1) Unharvested acreage has not been appraised by FSA, or a company 
reinsured by FCIC; or
    (2) Acceptable production records for harvested acres are not 
available from any source.
    (f) Assigned production for practices that result in lower yields 
than those for which the historic yield is based shall be established 
based on the acres found to have been subjected to those practices.
    (g) Assigned production for crops planted beyond the normal planting 
period for the crop shall be calculated according to the lateness of 
planting the crop. With the exception of replanted crops, if the crop is 
planted after the final planting date by:
    (1) 1 through 10 calendar days, the assigned production reduction 
will be based on one percent of the payment yield for each day involved;
    (2) 11 through 24 calendar days, the assigned production reduction 
will be based on 10 percent of the payment yield plus an additional two 
percent reduction of the payment yield for each days of days 11 through 
24 that are involved; and
    (3) 25 or more calendar days or a date from which the crop would not 
reasonably be expected to mature by harvest, the assigned production 
reduction will be based on 50 percent of the payment yield or such 
greater amount determined by the county committee to be appropriate.
    (h) Assigned production for producers with contracts to receive a 
guaranteed payment for production of an eligible crop will be 
established by the county committee by:
    (1) Determining the total amount of guaranteed payment for the unit;
    (2) Converting the guaranteed payment to guaranteed production by 
dividing the total amount of guaranteed payment by the approved county 
price for the crop or variety or such other factor deemed appropriate if 
otherwise the production would appear to be too high; and
    (3) Establishing the production for the unit as the greater of the 
actual

[[Page 745]]

net production for the unit or the guaranteed payment, or combination 
thereof if greater.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.10  Eligible disaster conditions.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this part 
applies to losses where the crop could not be planted or crop 
production, both in quantity and quality, was adversely affected by:
    (1) Damaging weather including drought, excessive moisture, hail, 
freeze, tornado, hurricane, typhoon, excessive wind, excessive heat or a 
combination thereof;
    (2) Damage from earthquake and volcano eruptions;
    (3) Insect infestation as a related condition to damaging weather;
    (4) Disease as a related condition to damaging weather;
    (5) Salt water intrusion of an irrigation supply;
    (6) Irrigation water rationing if proof is provided that water was 
rationed by a Government entity or water district;
    (7) Lack of water supply due to drought conditions for irrigated 
crops; or
    (8) Other causes or factors as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (b) Disaster benefits will not be available under this part if the 
crop could not be planted or crop production, both in quantity and 
quality, was adversely affected by:
    (1) Poor farming practices;
    (2) Poor management decisions; or
    (3) Drifting herbicides.
    (c) To the extent not otherwise compensated by USDA, 2000 CDP 
benefits will be made available under this part to also compensate:
    (1) Growers whose crops could not be sold due to Mexican fruit fly 
quarantines in San Diego and San Bernardino/Riverside counties in 
California since their imposition on November 16, 1999, and September 
10, 1999, respectively;
    (2) Growers in relation to the Secretary's ``Declaration of 
Extraordinary Emergency'' on March 2, 2000, regarding the plum pox 
virus;
    (3) Growers for 2000-crop losses due to Pierce's disease;
    (4) Growers for 2000-crop losses due to watermelon sudden wilt 
disease; and
    (5) Growers for 2000-crop losses incurred due to infestations of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets.
    (d) Losses for which compensation may be provided under paragraph 
(c) of this section will be compensated in the same manner, and subject 
to the same limitations as other general claims for crop losses under 
the 2000 CDP and shall be limited in scope to those claims that, as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, are allowable under the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and are consistent with the 
terms of the authorizing legislation. In handling such claims, and 
others, the Deputy Administrator may consult with other branches of the 
Department to determine the extent of losses and the effect of prior 
governmental action on marketing decisions made by the growers.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.11  Qualifying 2000-crop losses.

    (a) To receive disaster benefits under this part, the county 
committee must determine that because of a disaster, the producer with 
respect to the 2000 crop year:
    (1) Was prevented from planting a crop;
    (2) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the expected 
production of a crop; or
    (3) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the value for value 
loss crops.
    (b) Calculation of benefits under this part shall not include 
losses:
    (1) That are the result of poor management decisions or poor farming 
practices as determined by the county committee on a case-by-case basis;
    (2) That are the result of the failure of the producer to reseed or 
replant to the same crop in the county where it is customary to reseed 
or replant after a loss;
    (3) That are not as a result of a natural disaster, unless otherwise 
specified in Sec. 1480.10;
    (4) To crops not intended for harvest in crop year 2000;
    (5) To losses of by-products resulting from processing or harvesting 
a crop, such as cotton seed, peanut shells, wheat or oat straw;
    (6) To home gardens;

[[Page 746]]

    (7) That are a result of water contained or released by any 
governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project if an easement 
exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of the 
water; or
    (8) If losses could be attributed to conditions occurring outside of 
the applicable crop year growing season.
    (c) Calculation of benefits under this part for ornamental nursery 
stock shall not include losses:
    (1) Caused by a failure of power supply or brownouts;
    (2) Caused by the inability to market nursery stock as a result of 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;
    (3) Caused by fire;
    (4) Affecting crops where weeds and other forms of undergrowth in 
the vicinity of the nursery stock that have not been controlled; or
    (5) Caused by the collapse or failure of buildings or structures.
    (d) Calculation of benefits under this part for honey where the 
honey production by colonies or bees was diminished, shall not include 
losses:
    (1) Where the inability to extract was due to the unavailability of 
equipment; the collapse or failure of equipment or apparatus used in the 
honey operation;
    (2) Resulting from improper storage of honey;
    (3) To honey production because of bee feeding;
    (4) Caused by the application of chemicals;
    (5) Caused by theft, fire, or vandalism;
    (6) Caused by the movement of bees by the producer or any other 
person;
    (7) Due to disease or pest infestation of the colonies; or
    (8) Loss calculations shall take into account other conditions and 
adjustments provided for in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.12  Rates and yields; calculating payments.

    (a) Payment rates for 2000 year crop losses shall be:
    (1) 65 percent of the maximum established RMA price for insured 
crops;
    (2) 65 percent of the State average price for noninsurable crops; 
and
    (3) 60 percent of the maximum established RMA price for uninsured 
crops.
    (b) Except as provided elsewhere in this part, disaster benefits 
under this part for losses to crops shall be made in an amount 
determined by multiplying the loss of production in excess of 35 percent 
of the expected production by the applicable payment rate established 
according to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Separate payment rates and yields for the same crop may be 
established by the county committee as authorized by the Deputy 
Administrator, when there is supporting data from NASS or other sources 
approved by CCC that show there is a significant difference in yield or 
value based on a distinct and separate end use of the crop. In spite of 
differences in yield or values, separate rates or yields shall not be 
established for crops with different cultural practices, such as 
organically or hydroponically grown. Production from all end uses of a 
multi-use crop or all secondary uses for multiple market crops will be 
calculated separately and summarized together.
    (d) Each eligible producer's share of a disaster payment shall be 
based on the producer's share of the crop or crop proceeds, or, if no 
crop was produced, the share the producer would have received if the 
crop had been produced.
    (e) When calculating a payment for a unit loss:
    (1) an unharvested payment factor shall be applied to crop acreage 
planted but not harvested;
    (2) a prevented planting factor shall be applied to any prevented 
planted acreage eligible for payment; and
    (3) unharvested payment factors may be adjusted if costs normally 
associated with growing the crop are not incurred.
    (f) All payments made under this part shall conform to the 
requirements and limitations of this part and the Deputy Administrator 
may provide additional conditions or requirements as needed or 
appropriate to other wise serve the goals of the program. Nothing in 
this section shall prevent the Deputy Administrator from allowing a 
payment despite the receipt of the producer of a crop insurance payment, 
or a payment under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program 
operated

[[Page 747]]

under part 1437 of this chapter, as determined to be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.13  Production losses, producer responsibility.

    (a) Where available and determined accurate, RMA loss records will 
be used for insured crops.
    (b) If RMA loss records are not available, or if the FSA county 
committee determines the RMA loss records are inaccurate or incomplete, 
or if the FSA county committee makes inquiry, producers are responsible 
for:
    (1) Retaining or providing, when required, the best verifiable or 
reliable production records available for the crop;
    (2) Summarizing all the production evidence;
    (3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, 
whether or not records reflect this production;
    (4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily 
understood by the county committee; and (5) Providing supporting 
documentation if the county committee has reason to question the 
disaster event or that all production has been accounted for.
    (c) In determining production under this section the producer must 
supply verifiable or reliable production records to substantiate 
production to the county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or 
otherwise disposed of through commercial channels, production records 
include: commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger 
sheets; or load summaries; appraisal information from a loss adjuster 
acceptable to CCC. If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to 
livestock, or disposed of in means other than commercial channels, 
production records for these purposes include: truck scale tickets; 
appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to CCC; 
contemporaneous diaries; or other documentary evidence, such as 
contemporaneous measurements.
    (d) Producers must provide all records for any production of a crop 
that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed 
payment. The failure to report the existence of any guaranteed contract 
or similar arrangement or agreement shall be considered as providing 
false information to CCC and will render producers ineligible for 2000 
CDP benefits, and may lead to other civil or criminal sanctions.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.14  Determination of production.

    (a) Production under this part shall include all harvested 
production, unharvested appraised production and assigned production for 
the total planted acreage of the crop on the unit.
    (b) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more 
than once in a crop year shall include the total harvested production 
from all these harvests.
    (c) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested as the 
intended use, the actual harvested production shall be used to determine 
benefits.
    (d) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing 
assistance loans with an intended use of grain but harvested as silage, 
ensilage, cobbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be 
adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent as established by CCC.
    (e) For crops with an established yield and market price for 
multiple intended uses, a value will be calculated for each use with:
    (1) The intended use or uses for disaster purposes based on 
historical production and acreage evidence provided by the producer; and
    (2) The eligible acres for each use and the calculation of the 
disaster payment will be determined by the county committee according to 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (f) For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for 
the crop with no established county average yield and market price, 60 
percent of the salvage value received will be deducted from the disaster 
payment.
    (g) If a producer has an arrangement, agreement, or contract for 
guaranteed payment for production (as opposed to production based on 
delivery), the production shall be the greater of the actual production 
or the guaranteed payment converted to production as determined by CCC.
    (h) Production that is commingled between units before it was a 
matter or combination of record and cannot be

[[Page 748]]

separated by using records or other means acceptable to CCC shall be 
prorated to each respective unit by CCC. Commingled production may be 
attributed to the applicable unit, if the producer made the unit 
production of a commodity a matter of record before commingling and does 
any of the following, as applicable:
    (1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production 
of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from 
beyond the unit;
    (2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the county 
committee; or
    (3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner 
acceptable to the county committee.
    (i) The county committee shall assign production for the unit when 
the county committee determines that:
    (1) The producer has failed to provide adequate and acceptable 
production records;
    (2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not 
covered by this part, or circumstances other than natural disaster, and 
there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause of 
loss;
    (3) The producer carries out a practice, such as multiple cropping, 
that generally results in lower yields than the established historic 
yields;
    (4) The producer has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop;
    (5) A crop is late-planted;
    (6) Unharvested acreage was not timely appraised; or
    (7) Other appropriate causes exist for such assignment as determined 
by the Deputy Administrator.
    (j) For sugarcane, the quantity of sugar produced from such crop 
shall exclude acreage harvested for seed.
    (k) For peanuts, the actual production shall be all peanuts 
harvested for nuts regardless of their disposition or use as adjusted 
for low quality.
    (l) For tobacco, except flue-cured and burley, the actual production 
shall be the sum of the tobacco: marketed or available to be marketed; 
destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as determined by 
an appraisal. For flue-cured and burley tobacco, the actual production 
shall be the sum of the tobacco: marketed, regardless of whether the 
tobacco was produced in the current crop year or a prior crop year; on 
hand; destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as 
determined by an appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.15  Calculation of acreage for crop losses other than prevented planted.

    (a) Acreage shall be calculated using the number of acres shown to 
have been planted to a crop.
    (b) In cases where there is a repeat crop or a multiple planted crop 
in more than one planting period, or if there is multiple cropped 
acreage meeting criteria established in paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section, each of these crops may be considered separate crops for 2000 
CDP if the county committee determines that all of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted with 
an intent to harvest;
    (2) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted 
within the normal planting period for that crop;
    (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other 
eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices; 
and
    (4) Each planting could reach maturity if each planting was 
harvested or would have been harvested.
    (c) In cases where there is multiple cropped acreage, each crop may 
be eligible for disaster assistance separately if both of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) the specific crops are approved by the FSA State Committee as 
eligible multiple-cropping practices according to procedures approved by 
the Deputy Administrator; and
    (2) the farm containing the multiple cropped acreage has a history 
of multiple cropping based on timely filed crop acreage reports.
    (d) Producers with multiple cropped acreage not meeting the criteria 
in paragraph (c) of this section may be eligible for disaster assistance 
on more than one crop if the producer has

[[Page 749]]

verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful 
multiple cropping practice on the specific crops for which assistance is 
requested. All required records acceptable to CCC as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator must be provided before payments are issued.
    (e) Producers with multiple cropped acreage not meeting the criteria 
in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section must select the crop for which 
assistance will be requested. If more than one producer has an interest 
in the multiple cropped acreage, all producers must agree to the crop 
designated for payment by the end of the application period or no 
payment will be approved for any crop on the multiple cropped acreage.
    (f) Benefits under this part shall apply to irrigated crops where 
the acreage was affected by a lack of water or contamination by 
saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought 
conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.16  Calculation of prevented planted acreage.

    (a) When determining losses under this part, prevented-planted 
acreage will be considered separately from planted acreage of the same 
crop.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for insured 
crops, disaster payments under this part for prevented-planted acreage 
shall not be made unless RMA documentation indicates that the eligible 
producer received a prevented planting payment under the RMA-
administered program.
    (c) For insured crops, disaster payments under this part for 
prevented-planted acreage will be made available for the following crops 
for which prevented planting coverage was not available and for which 
the county committee will make an eligibility determination according to 
paragraph (d) of this section: peppers; sweet corn (fresh market); 
tomatoes (fresh market); tomatoes (processing).
    (d) The producer must prove, to the satisfaction of the county 
committee, an intent to plant the crop and that such crop could not be 
planted because of an eligible disaster. The county committee must be 
able to determine the producer was prevented from planting the crop by 
an eligible disaster that both:
    (1) Prevented most producers from planting on acreage with similar 
characteristics in the surrounding area; and
    (2) Unless otherwise approved by the Deputy Administrator, began no 
earlier than the planting season for that crop.
    (e) Prevented planted disaster benefits under this part shall not 
apply to:
    (1) Aquaculture, including ornamental fish; perennial forage crops 
grown for hay, seed, or grazing; honey; maple sap; millet; mint; nursery 
crops; cultivated wild rice; fresh market beans; cabbage, pumpkins, 
sweet potatoes; winter squash; tobacco, turfgrass sod and vine crops;
    (2) Uninsured crop acreage that is unclassified for insurance 
purposes;
    (3) Acreage that is used for conservation purposes or intended to be 
left unplanted under any USDA program;
    (4) Any acreage on which a crop other than a cover crop was 
harvested, hayed, or grazed during the crop year;
    (5) Any acreage for which a cash lease payment is received for the 
use of the acreage the same crop year unless the county committee 
determines the lease was for haying and grazing rights only and was not 
a lease for use of the land;
    (6) Acreage for which planting history or conservation plans 
indicate that the acreage would have remained fallow for crop rotation 
purposes;
    (7) Acreage for which the producer or any other person received a 
prevented planted payment for any crop for the same acreage, excluding 
share arrangements;
    (8) Acreage for which the producer cannot provide proof to the 
county committee that inputs such as seed, chemicals, and fertilizer 
were available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of at 
least producing a normal yield; and
    (9) Any other acreage for which, for whatever reason, there is cause 
to question whether the crop could have been planted for a successful 
and timely harvest, or for which prevented planting credit is not 
allowed under the provisions of this part.
    (f) Prevented planting payments are not provided on acreage that had 
either

[[Page 750]]

a previous or subsequent crop planted on the acreage, unless the county 
committee determines that all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) There is an established practice of planting two or more crops 
for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year;
    (2) Both crops could have reached maturity if each planting was 
harvested or would have been harvested;
    (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted or 
prevented-planting within the normal planting period for that crop;
    (4) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other 
eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices; 
and
    (5) The specific crops meet the eligibility criteria for a separate 
crop designation as a repeat or approved multiple cropping practice set 
out in Sec. 1480.15.
    (g) Disaster benefits under this part shall not apply to crops where 
the prevented-planted acreage was affected by a disaster that was caused 
by drought unless on the final planting date or the late planting period 
for non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being planted 
has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed and progress 
toward crop maturity because of a prolonged period of dry weather. 
Prolonged precipitation deficiencies must be verifiable using 
information collected by sources whose business it is to record and 
study the weather, including but not limited to the local weather 
reporting stations of the National Weather Service.
    (h) Prevented planting benefits under this part shall apply to 
irrigated crops where the acreage was prevented from being planted due 
to a lack of water resulting from drought conditions or contamination by 
saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought 
conditions.
    (i) For uninsured or noninsurable crops and the insured crops listed 
in paragraph (c) of this section, for prevented planting purposes:
    (1) The maximum prevented-planted acreage for all crops cannot 
exceed the number of acres of cropland in the unit for the crop year and 
will be reduced by the number of acres planted in the unit;
    (2) The maximum prevented planted acreage for a crop cannot exceed 
the number of acres planted by the producer, or that was prevented from 
being planted, to the crop in any 1 of the 1996 through 1999 crop years 
as determined by the county committee;
    (3) For crops grown under a contract specifying the number of acres 
contracted, the prevented-planted acreage is limited to the result of 
the number of acres specified in the contract minus planted acreage;
    (4) For each crop type or variety for which separate prices or 
yields are sought for prevented-planted acreage, the producer must 
provide evidence that the claimed prevented-planted acres were 
successfully planted in at least 1 of the most recent 4 crop years; and
    (5) The prevented planted acreage must be at least 20 acres or 20 
percent of the intended planted acreage in the unit, whichever is less.
    (j) Notwithstanding the provisions of part 718 of this chapter, 
late-filed crop acreage reports for previous years shall not be accepted 
for CDP purposes.

Sec. 1480.17  Quantity adjustments for diminished quality for certain crops.

    (a) For the crops identified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
subject to the provisions of this section and part, the quantity of 
production of crops of the producer shall be adjusted to reflect 
diminished quality resulting from the disaster.
    (b) Crops eligible for quality adjustments to production are limited 
to:
    (1) Barley; canola; corn; cotton; crambe, flaxseed; grain sorghum; 
mustard seed; oats; peanuts; rapeseed; rice; safflower; soybeans; sugar 
beets; sunflower-oil; sunflower-seed; tobacco; wheat; and
    (2) Crops with multiple market uses such as fresh, processed or 
juice, as supported by NASS data or other data determined acceptable.
    (c) The producer must submit documentation for determining the grade 
and other discount factors that were applied to the crop.

[[Page 751]]

    (d) Quality adjustments will be applied after production has been 
adjusted to standard moisture, when applicable.
    (e) For all crops listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except 
for cotton, if a quality adjustment has been made for multi-peril crop 
insurance purposes, an additional adjustment will not be made.
    (f) Quality adjustments for crops, other than cotton, peanuts, sugar 
beets and tobacco, listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be 
made by applying an adjustment factor based on dividing the Federal 
marketing assistance loan rate applicable to the crop and producer 
determined according to part 1421 of this chapter by the unadjusted 
county marketing assistance loan rate for the crop. For crops that 
receive a grade of ``sample'' and are marketed through normal channels, 
production will be adjusted as determined by CCC. County committees may, 
with state committee concurrence, establish county average quality 
adjustment factors.
    (g) Quality adjustments for cotton shall be based on the difference 
between:
    (1) The loan rate applicable to the crop and producer determined 
according to part 1427 of this chapter; and
    (2) The adjusted county loan rate. The adjusted county rate is the 
county loan rate adjusted for the 5-year county average historical 
quality premium or discount, as determined by CCC.
    (h) For quota and non-quota peanuts, quality adjustments shall be 
based on the difference between the actual sales price, or other 
proceeds, received and the National average support price by type of 
peanut for the applicable crop year.
    (i) Quality adjustments for sugar beets shall be based on sugar 
content. The 2000 actual production for the producer shall be adjusted 
upward or downward to account for sugar content as determined by CCC.
    (j) Quality adjustments for tobacco shall be based on the difference 
between the revenue received and the support price except that the 
market price may be used instead of the support price where market 
prices for the tobacco are normally in excess of the support price.
    (k) Quality adjustments for crops with multiple market uses such as 
fresh, processed and juice, shall be applied based on the difference 
between the producer's historical marketing percentage of each market 
use compared to the actual percentage for the 2000 crop year. These 
quality adjustments are built into the production loss determination. 
Production determinations from Federal crop insurance will not be used.
    (l) Except as determined by the Deputy Administrator, quality 
adjustments for aflatoxin shall be based on the aflatoxin level. The 
producer must provide the county committee with proof of a price 
reduction because of aflatoxin. The aflatoxin level must be 20 parts per 
billion or more before a quality adjustment will be made. The quality 
adjustment factor applied to affected production is .50 if the 
production is marketable. If the production is unmarketable due to 
aflatoxin levels of at least 20 parts per billion, production will be 
adjusted to zero. Any value received will be considered salvage.
    (m) Any quantity of the crop determined to be salvage will not be 
considered production. Salvage values shall be factored by 0.60 times 
the producer's share. This amount will be deducted from the disaster 
payment.
    (n) Quantity adjustments for diminished quality under this section 
will not be applied to crops that are, under Sec. 1480.18, value loss 
crops.
    (o) Quantity adjustments for diminished quality shall also not apply 
under this section to: hay, honey, maple sap, turfgrass sod, crops 
marketed for a use other than an intended use for which there is not an 
established county price or yield, or any other crop that the Deputy 
Administrator deems it appropriate to exclude.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.18  Value loss crops.

    (a) Irrespective of any inconsistent provisions in other sections, 
the provisions of this section shall be applied to the following crops, 
which will be considered ``value loss crops'': ornamental nursery; 
Christmas trees; vegetable and root stock including ginseng root; 
aquaculture, including ornamental

[[Page 752]]

fish, and such other crops as may be determined appropriate for 
treatment as ``value loss crops.''
    (b) For crops specified in paragraph (a) of this section, disaster 
benefits under this part are calculated based on the loss of value at 
the time of disaster, as determined by CCC.
    (c) For aquaculture, disaster benefits under this part for 
aquacultural species are limited to those aquacultural species that were 
placed in the aquacultural facility by the producer. Disaster benefits 
under this part shall not be made available for aquacultural species 
that are growing naturally in the aquaculture facility. Disaster 
benefits under this part are limited to aquacultural species that were 
planted or seeded on property owned or leased by the producer where that 
land has readily identifiable boundaries, and over which the producer 
has total control of the waterbed and the ground under the waterbed. 
Producers who only have control of the waterbed or the ground under the 
waterbed but not both will not be eligible for disaster benefits under 
this part.
    (d) For ornamental nursery crops, disaster benefits under this part 
are limited to ornamental nursery crops that were grown in a container 
or controlled environment for commercial sale on property owned or 
leased by the producer, and cared for and managed using good nursery 
growing practices. Indigenous crops are not eligible for benefits under 
this part.
    (e) For vegetable and root stock, disaster benefits under this part 
are limited to plants grown in a container or controlled environment for 
use as transplants or root stock by the producer for commercial sale or 
property owned or leased by the producer and managed using good 
rootstock or fruit and vegetable plant growing practices.
    (f) For ginseng, only ginseng that meets all the requirements of 
cultivated ginseng shall be considered as eligible for benefits under 
this part. Ginseng is defined as cultivated ginseng roots and seeds that 
meet the following requirements:
    (1) grown in raised beds above and away from wet and low areas 
protected from flood;
    (2) grown under man-made canopies that provide 75 to 80 percent 
shade coverage;
    (3) grown in well drained media with a pH adjustment of at least 5.5 
and which protects plants from disease; and
    (4) grown with sufficient fertility and weed control to obtain 
expected production results of ginseng root and seed.
    (g) Evidence of the above ginseng practice requirements must be 
provided by the producer if requested by the county committee. Any 
ginseng that is grown under cultivated practices or simulated wild or 
woodland conditions that do not meet these requirements are not eligible 
for disaster assistance under this part.
    (h) Because ginseng is a perennial crop, the producer must provide 
annual crop history to establish when the loss occurred and the extent 
of such loss. If the producer does not or is unable to provide annual 
records to establish the beginning inventory, before the loss, and 
ending inventory, after the loss, production shall be assigned by the 
county committee.
    (i) Aside from differences provided for in this section, all other 
conditions for eligibility contained in this part shall be applied to 
value loss crops.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.19  Other special provisions for specialty crops.

    (a) For turfgrass sod, disaster benefits under this part are limited 
to turfgrass sod that would have matured and been harvested during 2000, 
when a disaster caused in excess of 35 percent of the expected 
production to die.
    (b) For honey, disaster benefits under this part are limited to 
table and non-table honey produced commercially for human consumption. 
For calculating benefits, all honey is considered a single crop, 
regardless of type or variety of floral source or intended use.
    (c) For maple sap, disaster benefits under this part are limited to 
maple sap produced on private property in a controlled environment by a 
commercial operator for sale as sap or syrup. The maple sap must be 
produced from trees that are: located on land the producer controls by 
ownership or lease; managed for production of maple sap;

[[Page 753]]

and are at least 30 years old and 12 inches in diameter.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.20  Florida nursery crop losses.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, 2000 CDP benefits 
shall be made available for losses due to disasters afflicting nursery 
crops in the State of Florida that occur, because of disaster during the 
period beginning on October 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2000. 
Calculations of the amount of such losses shall be made independently of 
other losses of the producer, and such losses shall be subject to a 
separate limit on payment amounts as may otherwise apply. Any payment 
under this section for such losses shall for all purposes, present and 
future, be considered to be a 2000-crop payment, and such compensated 
losses shall be ineligible for any assistance that may become available 
for 2001 crop losses.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.21  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1480.22  Quality losses for 1999 and 2000 apples and potatoes.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, $37,916,400 
of CCC funds shall be made available until expended to producers of 1999 
and 2000-crop apples and potatoes for quality losses due to fireblight 
or weather related disasters, including but not limited to hurricane or 
hail damage.
    (b) Applications for benefits under this section must be filed 
before the close of business on May 4, 2001, or such other date that may 
be announced by the Deputy Administrator, in the county FSA office 
serving the county where the producer's operation is located for 
administrative purposes.
    (c) Payments issued under this section will be made regardless of 
whether the crop was harvested and without regard to:
    (1) A per person limitation on payment amount; however, a national 
payment factor may be applicable to all payments under this section if 
requests for benefits exceed the $37,916,400;
    (2) Restriction for the person's gross revenue; or
    (3) Qualifying loss threshold.
    (d) All or part of the benefits under this section shall not be 
issued if the producer received compensation for the same quality loss 
under any other Federal program, other than the Federal Crop Insurance 
Program.
    (e) Unless determined by the Deputy Administrator, all 2000-crop 
potato and apple claims will be addressed first under this section and 
if, after the handling of those claims under this section, it appears 
that for an individual producer that the producer would have received a 
greater compensation had the claim been treated in the same manner as 
other crops under the general program provided for in this part, then 
the difference shall be paid using that additional authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.23  Quality losses for 2000 crops.

    (a) Subject to other provisions of this part, CCC funds shall be 
made available for assistance to producers determined eligible under 
this section for crop quality losses greater than 20 percent of the 
value that the affected production of the crop would have had if the 
crop had not suffered a quality loss. The per unit amount of a quality 
loss for a producer's crop shall be equal to the difference between:
    (1) the unit market value of the units of the crop affected by the 
quality loss had the crop not suffered a quality loss; and
    (2) the per unit market value of the units of the crop affected by 
the quality loss.
    (b) The amount of payment for a quality loss shall be equal to 65 
percent of the quantity of the crop affected by the quality loss, 
multiplied by 65 percent of the per unit quality loss for the crop as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) This section will apply to all crops eligible for 2000-crop 
disaster assistance under this part including, but not limited to, 
forage crops and pecans, and will apply to crop production that has a 
reduced economic value due to the reduction in quality.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 1480.22(e), or as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator, producers may not be compensated under this 
section to the extent that such producers have received a payment under 
Sec. 1480.22 or received an adjustment on payment attributable in whole 
or in part to diminished quality

<R05>
Sec. 1481.4  Time and method of application.

    (a) FSA will mail an application form, CCC-870, from the Price 
Support Division located in Washington, D.C. to members of TVG that had 
a contract to produce an eligible commodity during crop year 2000. The 
mailed application will contain preprinted information obtained from 
TVG. Members of TVG may request an application form, CCC-870, from the 
California State FSA Office if an application is not received by mail 
seven business days after the start of the application period in person, 
by phone, by mail, or by facsimile. Members may obtain an application 
form, CCC-870, from the USDA eForms website at www.sc.egov.usda.gov 
seven business days after the start of the application period if an 
application is not received by mail. The application downloaded from the 
USDA eForms website will not have preprinted information; therefore, 
members will need to provide the appropriate information. The California 
State FSA Office will only need to receive one application per TVG 
member. The address for the California State FSA Office is in section 
12A and 12B of the application form. FSA will verify the information 
provided.
    (b) A request for payments under this part must be submitted on a 
completed application form. That application should be submitted to the 
California State FSA Office and must be received by the California State 
FSA office by close of business on April 6, 2001. Applications not 
received by the close of business on April 6, 2001, will be returned as 
not having been timely filed and the member will not be eligible for 
payments under this program.
    (c) The members of TVG requesting payments under this part must 
certify with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information 
provided in their application for payments. All information provided is 
subject to a spot check and other verification by FSA. Refusal to allow 
FSA or any other agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any 
information provided will result in a determination of ineligibility. 
Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without it program payments 
will not be approved. Providing a false certification to the Government 
is punishable by imprisonment, fines and other penalties.


<R05>
Sec. 1481.5  Eligibility.

    (a) To be eligible to receive a payment under this part, a member of 
TVG must:
    (1) Have suffered financial losses during crop year 2000 on eligible 
commodities under contract with TVG.
    (2) Apply for a payment during the application period.
    (b) Payments may be made for losses suffered by an eligible member 
who is now deceased or is a dissolved entity if a representative who 
currently has authority to act on behalf of the members, to the extent 
permitted by provisions of rules common to CCC programs. Proof of 
authority to sign for the deceased producer or dissolved entity must be 
provided. All members of a partnership or joint venture seeking 
benefits, or their duly authorized representatives, must sign the 
application for payment. If the entity has been dissolved all persons 
seeking payment because of the activities of that entity, or their 
representatives, must sign the application.
    (c) Members must submit a timely application and comply with all 
other terms and conditions of this part and instructions issued by CCC, 
as well as comply with those instructions that are otherwise contained 
in the application form to be eligible for a payment under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 1481.6  Availability of funds.

    The total available program funds shall not exceed $20 million as 
provided by section 843, as amended, of Public Law 106-387.


<R05>
Sec. 1481.7  Rate of payment and limitations on funding.

    (a) Subject to the availability of funds, payments under this part 
may be made to members who suffered eligible 2000-crop year financial 
losses, because of the insolvency of TVG. Information that was provided 
to FSA by TVG will be preprinted on the application form, CCC-870. 
Payments will be calculated after the conclusion of the application 
period, and shall be made in an amount determined by:
    (1) Having the member verify the eligible contracted commodities, 
the original dollar amount expected from TVG (calculated from TVG's 
final base price per commodity and the producer's contract production 
per commodity). The final base prices are fixed and no other price will 
be used to calculate the payments. The final base prices per ton to be 
used are $330 for apricots, $233 for yellow cling peaches, $243 for 
pears, and $48.50 for tomatoes. Contract production, final base price 
data and payments made to members of TVG for their 2000 crop year 
contract have been obtained from TVG.
    (2) Having the member verify the dollar amount received from TVG and 
the dollar amount received from any other source for the production that 
was under contract for the 2000 crop year with TVG.
    (3) Once the member verifies the relevant dollar amounts, FSA will 
calculate payments to individual members. Payments will be calculated by 
subtracting both the dollar amount received from TVG and the dollar 
amount received from any other source from the original dollar amount 
expected from TVG (calculated from TVG's final base price per commodity 
and the producer's contract production per commodity) on the contracted 
commodities. The difference will be considered to be the member's gross 
total loss for program purposes.
    (4) The gross payment amount for the producer shall not exceed 50 
percent of the member's gross total loss (authorized by the Act). At the 
close of the application period, if necessary, a uniform payment factor 
will be established so that total outlays will not exceed the $20 
million in funds available under this program. The uniform payment 
factor will be determined based on the factoring of the available funds 
of $20 million divided by the total eligible losses suffered.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1481.8  Offsets.

    (a) Any payment or portion thereof due any person under this part 
shall be allowed without regard to questions of title under State law, 
and without regard to any claim or lien against the member, the member's 
commodity, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the producer or any other 
creditors, including agencies of the U.S. Government.
    (b) The regulations governing offsets and withholdings found at 7 
CFR part 1403 shall not be applicable to this part.
    (c) Any payments received by a member of TVG are not subject to 
assignments, administrative offsets or withholdings, including 
administrative offset under chapter 37 of title 31, United States Code, 
as provided by P.L. 106-387.

this part may make a request for reconsideration or appeal of such 
determination in accordance with the appeal regulations set forth at 7 
CFR parts 11 and 780.


<R05>
Sec. 1481.10  Misrepresentation.

    (a) Whoever issues a false document or otherwise acts in violation 
of the provisions of this program so as to enable a member to obtain a 
payment to which such member is not entitled, shall become liable to CCC 
for any payment which CCC may have made in reliance on such sales 
document or as a result of such other action.
    (b) The issuance of, or assistance in the issuance of, a false 
document or the making of, or assistance in the making of, a false 
statement in an application for payment or other document, for the 
purpose of enabling a person to obtain a payment to which such person is 
not

[[Page 757]]

entitled, may subject the person issuing such document or making such 
statement, or assisting in such acts, or benefitting from such acts, to 
liability under applicable Federal civil and criminal statutes. Such 
person shall also be liable for a refund of all program payments made 
along with any other person who is also liable for such repayments.


<R05>
Sec. 1481.11  Maintaining records.

    Members making application for a payment under this program must 
maintain accurate records and accounts that will document that they meet 
all eligibility requirements specified for the program. Such records and 
accounts are subject to spot-checks and must be retained for three years 
after the date of payment to the producer under this program and any 
disposition after that time is at the risk of the producer if there is 
cause to believe that there are program matters at issue or which could 
become at issue.


<R05>
Sec. 1481.12  Estates, trust, and minors.

    (a) Program documents purportedly executed by a person legally 
authorized to represent estates or trusts will be accepted only if such 
person furnishes evidence of the authority to execute such documents.
    (b) A minor who is an otherwise eligible producer of the eligible 
commodities shall be eligible for assistance under this part only if 
such producer meets one of the following requirements:
    (1) The minor establishes that the right of majority has been 
conferred on the minor by court proceedings or by statute;
    (2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property and 
has executed the applicable program documents; or
    (3) A bond is furnished under which the surety guarantees any loss 
incurred for which the minor would be liable had the minor been an 
adult.


<R05>
Sec. 1481.13  Death, incompetency, or disappearance.

    In the case of death, incompetency, disappearance or dissolution of 
a producer that is eligible to receive benefits in accordance with this 
part, such person or persons specified in part 707 of this title may 
receive such benefits, as determined appropriate by FSA.


<R05>
Sec. 1481.14  Refunds; joint and several liability.

    (a) In the event there is a failure to comply with any term, 
requirement, or condition for payment arising under the application or 
this part, and if any refund of a payment to CCC shall otherwise become 
due in connection with the application or this part, all payments made 
under this part to any member shall be refunded to CCC together with 
interest as determined in accordance with this section and late payment 
charges as provided in part 1403 of this chapter.
    (b) All members signing an application for payment as having an 
interest in such payments shall be jointly and severally liable for any 
refund, including related charges, that is determined to be due for any 
reason under the terms and conditions of the application or this part. 
Reference in this part to ``application'' and ``form application'' shall 
be taken to be interchangeable.
    (c) Interest shall be applicable to refunds required of any producer 
under this part if CCC determines that payments or other assistance were 
provided to a producer who was not eligible for such assistance or 
determines that a refund is due for any other reason. Such interest 
shall be charged at the rate of interest that the United States Treasury 
charges the CCC for funds, as of the date CCC made benefits available.

[[Page 763]]


<R05>
Sec. 1484.12  What is the Cooperator program?

    (a) Under the Foreign Market Development Cooperator (Cooperator) 
Program, FAS enters into project agreements with eligible nonprofit U.S. 
trade organizations to share the costs of certain overseas marketing and 
promotion activities that are intended to create, expand, or maintain 
foreign markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and products. FAS does 
not provide brand promotion assistance to Cooperators under this 
program.
    (b) FAS enters into project agreements with those eligible nonprofit 
U.S. trade organizations that have the broadest possible producer 
representation of the commodity being promoted and gives priority to 
those organizations that are nationwide in membership and scope. Project 
agreements involve the promotion of agricultural commodities on a 
generic basis. Project agreements do not involve activities targeted 
directly toward consumers purchasing as individuals. Activities must 
contribute to the maintenance or growth of demand for the agricultural 
commodities and generally address long-term foreign import constraints 
and export growth opportunities by focusing on matters such as reducing 
infra-structural or historical market impediments; improving processing 
capabilities; modifying codes and standards; and identifying new markets 
or new applications or uses for the agricultural commodity or product in 
the foreign market.
    (c) The Cooperator program generally operates on a reimbursement 
basis.
    (d) FAS policy is to ensure that benefits generated by Cooperator 
agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural 
sector and no one entity gains an undue advantage or sole benefit from 
program activities.

of a single company.
    Market--a country or region in which an activity is conducted.
    Marketing plan year--the program year beginning on October 1 and 
ending on September 30, during which Cooperators can undertake 
activities, consistent with this part and their agreements with FAS, and

50 percent of the value of resources provided by FAS for activities 
conducted under the project agreement.
    (b) FAS may require that a project agreement include a contribution 
level greater than that specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In 
requiring a higher contribution level, FAS will take into account such 
factors as past Cooperator contributions, previous Cooperator program 
funding levels, the length of time an entity participates in the 
program, and the entity's ability to increase its contribution.
    (c) FAS will enter into Cooperator agreements only for the promotion 
of eligible commodities.


<R04>
               Subpart B--Application and Fund Allocation


<R05>
Sec. 1484.20  How can my organization apply to the Cooperator program?

dollars or as a percentage of paragraph (a)(10) of this section;
    (13) A description of the eligible commodity(s); the associated 
commodity aggregate code(s), obtained from FAS; and the percentage of 
U.S. origin content by weight, exclusive of added water; and
    (14) A certification statement, and, if requested by the Deputy 
Administrator, a written explanation supporting the certification, that 
any funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or 
industry funds or other contributions to program activities. The written 
explanation, if necessary, shall indicate why the Cooperator is unlikely 
to carry out the activities without Federal financial assistance. The 
certification shall also state that information contained in the 
application is true and accurate and that all records supporting the 
claim that project funds do not supplant other funds will be made 
available to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
    (b) Strategic plan and performance measures. All Cooperator program 
applications shall also contain:
    (1) A description of the U.S. and world market situation for the

job titles, corresponding position descriptions, salary ranges, and any 
request for approval of salaries above the Foreign Service National 
(FSN) salary plan. To request approval of a salary above the FSN salary 
plan, the Cooperator shall include a detailed description of both the 
duties and responsibilities of the position, and of the qualifications 
and background of the individual concerned. The Cooperator shall also 
justify, based on a verifiable local salary survey or other documented 
local salary information, why the highest FSN salary level is 
inappropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.21  How does FAS determine which Cooperator program applications are approved?

    (a) General. FAS allocates funds in a manner that effectively 
supports the strategic decision-making initiatives of the Government 
Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. In deciding whether a 
proposed project will contribute to the effective creation, expansion, 
or maintenance of foreign markets, FAS seeks to identify those projects 
that would demonstrate a

[[Page 766]]

clear, long-term agricultural trade strategy by market or product and a 
program effectiveness time line against which results can be measured at 
specific intervals using quantifiable product or country or region 
goals. These performance indicators are part of FAS' resource allocation 
strategy to fund applicants which can demonstrate performance based on a 
long-term strategic plan and address the performance measurement 
objectives of the GPRA.
    (b) Approval criteria. FAS will consider a number of factors when 
reviewing proposed projects, including:
    (1) The ability of the organization to provide an experienced U.S.-
based staff with technical and international trade expertise to ensure

Cooperator's U.S. office to the Director, Marketing Operations Staff, 
FAS, USDA.
    (c) FAS will not reimburse claims submitted later than 6 months 
after the end of a marketing plan year.
    (d) If FAS overpays a reimbursement claim, the Cooperator shall 
repay FAS within 30 days the amount of the overpayment either by 
submitting a check payable to FAS or by offsetting its next 
reimbursement claim.
    (e) If a Cooperator receives a reimbursement or offsets an advanced 
payment which is later disallowed, the Cooperator shall within 30 days 
of such disallowance repay FAS the amount owed either by submitting a 
check payable to FAS or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim.

<R05>
Sec. 1484.57  Will FAS make advance payments to a Cooperator?

    (a) Policy. In general, FAS operates the Cooperator program on a 
reimbursable basis.
    (b) Exception. Upon request, FAS may make two types of advance 
payments to a Cooperator. The first is a revolving fund operating 
advance provided by

[[Page 774]]

FAS only to Cooperators with foreign offices supported with project 
funds. The second is a special advance payment used to pay an impending 
large cost item. FAS will provide this type of advance expense payment 
in lieu of direct payments by FAS to vendors or other third parties. All 
Cooperators, with or without project fund-supported foreign offices, are 
eligible to request special advance payments. Normally, special advance 
payments received from FAS must be liquidated by the Cooperator within 
90 days from the date of receipt. Prior to making an advance, FAS may 
require the participant to submit security in a form and amount 
acceptable to FAS to protect FAS' financial interests. FAS will not make 
any special advance payment to a Cooperator where a special advance is 
outstanding from a prior marketing plan year. Cooperators shall deposit 
and maintain advances in insured, interest-bearing accounts, unless such 
accounts are prohibited by law or custom of a host country.
    (c) Refunds due FAS. A participant shall return any unexpended 
portion of an advance, plus any interest earned, either by submitting a 
check payable to FAS or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. All 
checks shall be mailed to the Director, Marketing Operations Staff, FAS, 
USDA.

<R05>
Sec. 1484.71  Are Cooperator documents subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act?

    (a) Documents submitted to FAS by Cooperators are subject to the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, 7 CFR 
part 1, Subpart A--Official Records, and, specifically, 7 CFR 1.11--
Handling Information from a Private Business.
    (b) If requested by a person located in the United States, a 
Cooperator shall provide to such person a copy of any document in its 
possession or control containing market information developed and 
produced under the terms of its agreement. The Cooperator may charge a 
fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and 
distributing the materials.
    (c) The results of any research conducted by a Cooperator under an 
agreement shall be the property of the U.S. Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.72  How is program effectiveness measured?

    (a) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 
U.S.C.

[[Page 775]]

306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance 
measurement of Federal programs, including the Cooperator program. 
Evaluation of the Cooperator program's effectiveness will depend on a 
clear statement by each Cooperator of the constraints and opportunities 
facing U.S. exports, goals to be met within a specified time, a schedule 
of measurable milestones for gauging success, a plan for achievement, 
and reports of activity results.
    (b) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and 
implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The 
evaluation results guide the development and scope of a Cooperator's 
program, contribute to program accountability, and provide evidence of 
program effectiveness.
    (c) A Cooperator shall conduct periodic evaluations of its program 
and activities and may contract with an independent evaluator to satisfy 
this requirement. FAS reserves the right to have direct input and 
control over design, scope, and methodology of any such evaluation, 
including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the 
independent evaluator.
    (d) A Cooperator shall complete at least one program evaluation each 
year. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be 
determined by the Cooperator and the Division Director and specified in 
the Cooperator's application approval letter. A program evaluation shall 
contain:
    (1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
    (2) The activities covered by the evaluation;
    (3) A concise statement of the constraint(s) and opportunities and 
the goals specified in the application;
    (4) A description of the evaluation methodology;
    (5) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the 
ratio of additional export sales in relation to Cooperator program 
funding received;
    (6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
    (7) Recommendations for future programs.
    (e) A Cooperator shall submit, via a cover letter to the Division 
Director, an executive summary which assesses the program evaluation's 
findings and recommendations and proposes changes in program strategy or 
design as a result of the evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.73  Are Cooperators penalized for failing to make required contributions?

    A Cooperator's contribution requirement is specified in the 
Cooperator program allocation letter. If a Cooperator fails to 
contribute the amount specified in its allocation approval letter, the 
Cooperator shall pay to Commodity Credit Corporation in U.S. dollars the 
difference between the amount it has contributed and the amount 
specified in the allocation approval letter. A Cooperator shall remit 
such payment by December 31 following the end of the marketing plan 
year.

<R05>
Sec. 1484.74  How is Cooperator program compliance monitored?

    (a) The Compliance Review Staff (CRS), FAS, performs periodic on-
site reviews of Cooperators to ensure compliance with this part.
    (b) In order to verify that federal funds received by a Cooperator 
do not supplant private or U.S. industry funds or contributions pursuant 
to Sec. 1550.20(a)(14), FAS will consider the Cooperator's overall 
marketing budget from year to year, variations in promotional strategies 
within a country or region, and new markets.
    (c) The Director, CRS, will notify a Cooperator through a compliance 
report when it appears that Commodity Credit Corporation may be entitled 
to recover funds from that Cooperator. The compliance report will state 
the basis for this action.

[64 FR 52630, Sept. 30, 1999. Redesignated and amended at 65 FR 9995, 
9996, Feb. 25, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1484.75  How does a Cooperator respond to a compliance report?

    (a) A Cooperator shall, within 60 days of the date of the compliance 
report, submit a written response to the Director, CRS. This response 
shall include any money owed to Commodity Credit Corporation if the 
Cooperator does not wish to contest the compliance report. The Director, 
CRS, at the Director's

[[Page 776]]

discretion, may extend the period for response up to an additional 30 
days. If the Cooperator does not respond to the compliance report within 
the required time period or, if after review of the Cooperator's 
response, the Director, CRS, determines that Commodity Credit 
Corporation may be entitled to recover funds from the Cooperator, the 
Director, CRS, will refer the compliance report to the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (b) If, after review of the compliance report and response, the 
Deputy Administrator determines that the Cooperator owes money to FAS, 
the Deputy Administrator will so inform the Cooperator. The Deputy 
Administrator may initiate action to collect such amount pursuant to 7 
CFR Part 1403, Debt Settlement Policies and Procedures. Determinations 
of the Deputy Administrator will be in writing and in sufficient detail 
to inform the Cooperator of the basis for the determination. The 
Cooperator has 30 days from the date of the Deputy Administrator's 
initial determination to submit any money owed to Commodity Credit 
Corporation or to request reconsideration.

[64 FR 52630, Sept. 30, 1999. Redesignated and amended at 65 FR 9995, 
9996, Feb. 25, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1484.76  Can a Cooperator appeal the determinations of the Deputy Administrator?

    (a) The Cooperator may appeal the determinations of the Deputy 
Administrator to the Administrator. An appeal must be in writing and be 
submitted to the Office of the Administrator within 30 days following 
the date of the initial determination by the Deputy Administrator or the 
determination on reconsideration. The Cooperator may request a hearing.
    (b) If the Cooperator submits its appeal and requests a hearing, the 
Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, will set a date and 
time, generally within 60 days. The hearing will be an informal 
proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the 
Cooperator bears the cost of a transcript; however, the Administrator 
may have a transcript prepared at FAS's expense.
    (c) The Administrator will base the determination on appeal upon 
information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to 
make a determination within 60 days after submission of the appeal, 
hearing, or receipt of any transcript, whichever is later. The 
determination of the Administrator will be the final determination of 
FAS. The Cooperator must exhaust all administrative remedies contained 
in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by 
the Administrator.

Sec. 1485.14  Application approval and formation of agreements.

    (a) General. CCC will, consistent with available resources, approve 
those applications which it considers to present the best opportunity 
for developing, maintaining or expanding export markets for U.S. 
agricultural commodities. The selection process, by its nature, involves 
the exercise of judgment. CCC's choice of participants and proposed 
promotion projects requires that it consider and weigh a number of 
factors that cannot be mathematically measured--i.e., market 
opportunity, market strategy and management capability.
    (b) Approval criteria. In assessing the applications it receives and 
determining which it will approve, CCC considers the following criteria:
    (1) The effectiveness of program management;
    (2) Soundness of accounting procedures;
    (3) The nature of the applicant organization, with greater weight 
given to those organizations with the broadest base of producer 
representation;
    (4) Prior export promotion or direct export experience;
    (5) Previous MAP funding;
    (6) Adequacy of the applicant's strategic plan in the following 
categories:
    (i) Description of market conditions;
    (ii) Description of, and plan for addressing, market constraints;
    (iii) Reasonable likelihood of plan success;
    (iv) Export volume and value and market share goals in each country;
    (v) Description of evaluation plan and suitability of the plan for 
performance measurement; and
    (vi) Past program results and evaluations, if applicable.
    (c) Allocation factors. After determining which applications to 
approve, CCC determines how it will allocate resources among 
participants based on the following factors, in addition to those in 
paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Size of the budget request in relation to projected value of 
exports;

[[Page 782]]

    (2) Where applicable, size of the budget request in relation to 
actual value of exports in prior years;
    (3) Where applicable, participant's past projections of exports 
compared with actual exports;
    (4) Level of participant's, State's, and industry's contributions;
    (5) Market share goals in target country(ies);
    (6) The degree to which the product to be exported consists of U.S. 
grown agricultural commodities;
    (7) The degree of value-added processing in the U.S.; and
    (8) General administrative and overhead costs compared to direct 
promotional costs.
    (9) In the case of a brand promotion program, the percentage of the 
budget that will be made available to small-sized entities as a means of 
providing priority assistance to such entities.
    (d) Approval decision. (1) CCC will approve those applications which 
it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified above. In 
addition, CCC will only approve applications for EIP/MAP when there is 
sufficient U.S. industry need for a brand promotion and there is no 
eligible MAP participant interested in or capable of undertaking the 
brand promotion.
    (2) CCC will not provide assistance to a single company for brand 
promotion in a single country for more than five years. This five year 
period shall not begin prior to the 1994 program or the participant's 
first activity plan year, whichever is later. In limited circumstances, 
the five year limitation may be waived if the Deputy Administrator 
determines that further assistance is necessary in order to meet the 
objectives of the program.
    (e) Formation of agreements. CCC will notify each applicant in 
writing of the final disposition of its application. CCC will send a 
program agreement, allocation approval letter and a signature card to 
each approved applicant. The allocation approval letter will specify any 
special terms and conditions applicable to a participant's program, 
including the required level of participant contribution. An applicant 
that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the program 
agreement and allocation approval letter should so indicate by having 
its Chief Executive Officer sign the program agreement and by submitting 
the signed agreement to the Director, Marketing Operations Staff, FAS, 
USDA. Final agreement shall occur when the Administrator signs the 
agreement on behalf of CCC. The application, the program agreement, the 
allocation approval letter and these regulations shall establish the 
terms and conditions of an MAP or EIP/MAP agreement between CCC and the 
approved applicant.
    (f) Signature cards. The participant shall designate at least two 
individuals in its organization to sign program agreements, 
reimbursement claims and advance requests. The participant shall submit 
the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the 
participant's Chief Executive Officer to the Director, Marketing 
Operations Staff, FAS, USDA, and shall immediately notify the Director 
of any changes in signatories and shall submit a revised signature card 
accordingly.

FR 29940, June 2, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1485.15  Activity plan.

    (a) General. A participant shall develop a specific activity plan(s) 
based on its strategic plan and the allocation approval letter and shall 
submit an activity plan for each year in which it engages in program 
activities. An activity plan handbook, available from the Division 
Director, provides suggested formats and codes for activity plans and 
amendments.
    (b) An activity plan shall contain:
    (1) A written presentation of all proposed activities including:
    (i) A short description of the relevant constraint;
    (ii) A description of any changes in strategy from the strategic 
plan;
    (iii) A budget for each proposed activity, identifying the source of 
funds;
    (iv) Specific goals and benchmarks to be used to measure the 
effectiveness of each activity. This will assist CCC in carrying out its 
responsibilities under the Government Performance and Results Act of 
1993 that requires performance measurement of Federal programs, 
including the MAP. Evaluation of MAP's effectiveness will depend on a

[[Page 783]]

clear statement by participants of goals, method of achievement, and 
results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of the MAP 
and of individual participants' activities is to achieve additional 
exports of U.S. agricultural products, that is, sales that would not 
have occurred in the absence of MAP funding.
    (2) A staffing plan for any overseas office, including a listing of 
job titles, position descriptions, salary ranges and any request for 
approval of supergrade salaries; and
    (3) An itemized administrative budget for any overseas office.
    (c) Activity plans for small-sized entities operating through an 
SRTG shall contain a certification that it is a small-sized entity 
within the standards established by 13 CFR part 121.
    (d) Requests for approval of ``supergrades''. (1) Ordinarily, CCC 
will not reimburse any portion of a non-U.S. citizen employees 
compensation that exceeds the highest salary level in the Foreign 
Service National (FSN) salary plan applicable to the country in which 
the employee works. However, a participant may seek a higher level of 
reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen who will be employed as a country 
director or regional director by requesting that CCC approve that 
employee as a ``supergrade''.
    (2) To request approval of a ``supergrade'', the participant shall 
include in its activity plan a detailed description of both the duties 
and responsibilities of the position, and of the qualifications and 
background of the employee concerned. The participant shall also justify 
why the highest FSN salary level is insufficient.
    (3) Where a non-U.S. citizen will be employed as a country director, 
the MAP participant may request approval for a ``Supergrade I'' salary 
level, equivalent to a grade increase over the existing top grade of the 
FSN salary plan. The ``supergrade'' and its step increases are 
calculated as the percentage difference between the second highest and 
the highest grade in the FSN salary plan with that percentage applied to 
each of the steps in the top grade. Where the non-U.S. citizen will be 
employed as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/
or offices in more than one country, the MAP participant may request 
approval for a ``Supergrade II'' salary level which is calculated 
relative to a ``Supergrade I'' in the same way the latter is calculated 
relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary plan.
    (e) Submission of the activity plan. A participant shall submit 
three copies of an activity plan to the Division Director and a copy of 
the relevant country section(s) to the Attach[eacute]/Counselor(s) 
concerned.
    (f) Activity plan approval. CCC shall indicate in an activity plan 
approval letter which activities and budgets are approved or 
disapproved, and shall indicate any special terms and conditions that 
apply to the participant including any requirements with respect to 
contributions and program evaluations. A participant may undertake 
promotional activities directly or through a foreign third party; 
however, the participant shall be responsible and accountable to CCC for 
all such promotional activities and related expenditures.
    (g) Activity plan changes. (1) A participant may request changes to 
an activity plan by submitting one copy of an APAR to each of the 
Division Director and the Attach[eacute]/Counselor(s) concerned.
    (2) An APAR for a new activity shall contain the information 
required in paragraph (b) of this section. All other APAR's shall 
contain the activity description, the proposed budget and a 
justification for transfer of funds, if applicable.

documents supporting reimbursement claims.
    (b) Reports. (1) End-of-Year Contribution Report. Not later than 6 
months after the end of its activity plan year, a participant shall 
submit two copies of a report which identifies, by activity and cost 
category and in U.S. dollar equivalent, contributions made by the 
participant, the U.S. industry and foreign third parties during that 
activity plan year. A suggested format of a contribution report is 
available from the Division Director.
    (2) Trip reports. Not later than 45 days after completion of travel 
(other than local travel), an MAP participant shall submit a trip 
report. The report must include the name(s) of the traveler(s), purpose 
of travel, itinerary, names and affiliations of contacts, and a brief 
summary of findings, conclusions, recommendations or specific 
accomplishments.
    (3) Research reports. Not later than 6 months after the end of its 
activity plan year, an MAP participant shall submit a report on any 
research conducted in accordance with the activity plan.
    (4) A participant shall submit the reports required by this 
subsection to the appropriate Division Director. Trip reports and 
research reports shall also be submitted to the Attache/Counselor 
concerned. All reports shall be in English and include the participant's 
agreement number, the countries covered, date of the report and the 
period covered in the report.
    (5) CCC may require the submission of additional reports.
    (6) A participant shall provide to the FAS Compliance Review Staff 
upon request any audit reports by independent public accountants.
    (c) Evaluation--(1) Policy. (i) The Government Performance and 
Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 
3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, 
including MAP. Evaluation of MAP's effectiveness will depend on a clear 
statement by participants of goals to be met within a specified time, 
schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, plan for 
achievement, and results of activities at regular intervals. The overall 
goal of the MAP and of individual participants' activities is to achieve 
additional exports of U.S. agricultural products, that is, sales that 
would not have occurred in the absence of MAP funding. A participant 
that can demonstrate additional sales compared to a representative base 
period, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the participant's 
control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need 
for evaluation.
    (ii) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and 
implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan and activity 
plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a 
participant's program, contributing to program accountability and 
providing evidence of program effectiveness.
    (iii) An MAP participant shall conduct periodic evaluations of its 
program and activities and may contract with an independent evaluator to 
satisfy this requirement. CCC reserves the right to have direct input 
and control over design, scope and methodology of any such evaluation, 
including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the 
independent evaluator.
    (2) Types of evaluation. (i) An activity evaluation is a review of 
an activity to determine whether such activity achieved the goals 
specified in the activity plan. Unless specifically exempted in the 
activity plan, all activity

[[Page 789]]

evaluations shall be completed within 90 days following the end of the 
MAP participant's activity plan year.
    (ii) A brand promotion evaluation is a review of the U.S. and 
foreign commercial entities' export sales to determine whether the 
activity achieved the goals specified in the activity plan. These 
evaluations shall be completed within 90 days following the end of the 
participant's activity plan year.
    (iii) A program evaluation is a review of the MAP participant's 
entire program or any appropriate portion of the program to determine 
the effectiveness of the participant's strategy in meeting specified 
goals. An MAP participant shall complete at least one program evaluation 
each year. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be 
determined by the MAP participant and the Division Director and 
specified in the MAP participant's activity plan approval letter.
    (3) Contents of program evaluation. A program evaluation shall 
contain:
    (i) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
    (ii) The activities covered by the evaluation (including the 
activity numbers);
    (iii) A concise statement of the constraint(s) and the goals 
specified in the activity plan;
    (iv) A description of the evaluation methodology;
    (v) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the 
ratio of additional export sales in relation to MAP funding received;
    (vi) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
    (vii) Recommendations for future programs.
    (4) An MAP participant shall submit via a cover letter to the 
Division Director, an executive summary which provides assessment of the 
program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposed changes 
in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation.
    (5) If as a result of an evaluation or audit of activities of a 
participant under the program, CCC determines that further review is 
needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 
program, CCC may require the participant to contract for an independent 
audit of the program activities,
    (d) Appeals. (1) The Director, Compliance Review Staff (Director, 
CRS) will notify a participant through a compliance report when it 
appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from that participant. 
The compliance report will state the basis for this action.
    (2) A participant may, within 60 days of the date of the compliance 
report, submit a response to the Director, CRS. The Director, CRS, at 
the Director's discretion, may extend the period for response up to an 
additional 30 days. If the participant does not respond to the 
compliance report within the required time period or, if after review of 
the participant's response, the Director, CRS, determines that CCC may 
be entitled to recover funds from the participant, the Director, CRS, 
will refer the compliance report to the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) If after review of the compliance report and response, the 
Deputy Administrator determines that the participant owes any money to 
CCC he will so inform the participant and provide the basis for the 
decision. The Deputy Administrator may initiate action to collect such 
amount pursuant to 7 C.F.R. Part 1403, Debt Settlement Policies and 
Procedures. Determinations of the Deputy Administrator will be in 
writing and in sufficient detail to inform the participant of the basis 
for the determination. The participant may request reconsideration 
within 30 days of the date of the Deputy Administrator's initial 
determination.
    (4) The Participant may appeal determinations of the Deputy 
Administrator to the Administrator. An appeal must be in writing and be 
submitted to the office of the Deputy Administrator within 30 days 
following the date of the initial determination by the Deputy 
Administrator or the determination on reconsideration. The participant 
may request a hearing.
    (5) If the participant submits its appeal and requests a hearing, 
the Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, will set a date and 
time, generally within 60 days. The hearing will be an informal 
proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless

[[Page 790]]

the participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, the 
Administrator may have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.
    (6) The Administrator will base the determination on appeal upon 
information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to 
make a determination within 60 days after submission of the appeal, 
hearing or receipt of any transcript, whichever is later. The 
determination of the Administrator will be the final determination of 
CCC. The participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained 
in this subsection before pursuing judicial review of a determination by 
the Administrator.

U.S.'', ``Grown in the U.S.A.'', ``Made in America'' or other U.S. 
regional designation if approved in advance by CCC; that such origin 
identification will be conspicuously displayed, in a manner that is 
easily observed; and that such origin identification will conform, to 
the extent possible, to the U.S. standard of 1/6<gr-thn-eq> (.42 
centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter ``o''. A 
participant may request an exemption from this requirement. All such 
requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory to 
the Deputy Administrator that this labelling requirement would hinder a 
participant's promotional efforts. The Deputy Administrator will 
determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification 
exists to grant an exemption from the labelling requirement;
    (7) Specify documentation requirements for a U.S. brand applicant 
seeking priority consideration for assistance based on eligibility as a 
small-sized entity;
    (8) Require that the U.S. brand participant submit to the MAP

America'' or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance by 
CCC; such origin identification is conspicuously displayed in a manner 
that is easily observed, and that, to the fullest extent possible, the 
origin identification conforms to the U.S. standard of 1/6<gr-thn-eq> 
(.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter ``o''. An 
EIP/ MAP participant may request an exemption from this requirement. All 
such requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory 
to the Deputy Administrator that this labelling requirement would hinder 
a participant's promotional efforts. The Deputy Administrator will 
determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification 
exists to grant an exemption from the labelling requirement;
    (g) Travel shall conform to U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR 
parts 301 through 304) and air travel shall conform to the requirements 
of the ``Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 1517).'' The MAP participant shall 
notify the Attach[eacute]/Counselor in the destination countries in 
writing in advance of any proposed travel.
    (h) Proceeds. Any income or refunds generated from an activity, 
i.e., participation fees, proceeds of sales, refunds of value added 
taxes (VAT), the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially 
reimbursed, shall be repaid by submitting a check payable to CCC or 
offsetting the participant's next reimbursement claim. However, where 
CCC reimburses a participant with CCC commodity certificates, such 
participant may retain any income generated by the sale of such 
certificates.

<R05>
Sec. 1487.1  What special definitions apply to the TASC program?

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
    CCC--Commodity Credit Corporation.
    FAS--Foreign Agricultural Service, United States Department of 
Agriculture.
    Specialty crop--all cultivated plants, or the products thereof, 
produced in the United States, except wheat, feed grains, oilseeds,

<R05>
Sec. 1487.2  What is the TASC program?

    Under the TASC program, CCC, an agency and instrumentality of the 
United States within the Department of Agriculture, provides funds to 
eligible organizations, on a grant basis, to implement activities that 
are intended to address a sanitary, phytosanitary, or related technical 
barrier that prohibit or threaten the export of U.S. specialty crops 
that are currently available on a commercial basis. The TASC program is 
intended to benefit the represented industry rather than a specific 
company or brand. This program is administered by FAS.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.3  What activities are eligible?

    (a) General. In order to be eligible for funding under the TASC 
program, activities must address sanitary, phytosanitary, or technical 
barriers to export of specialty crops. Examples of expenses that CCC may 
agree to cover under the TASC program include, but are not limited to: 
initial pre-clearance programs, export protocol and work plan support, 
seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest 
lists, pest and disease research, database development, reasonable 
logistical and administrative support, and travel and per diem expenses.
    (b) Location of activities. Eligible projects may take place in the 
United States or abroad.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.4  Are there any limits on the scope of proposals?

    (a) Funding cap. TASC proposals which request more than $250,000 of 
CCC funding in a given year will not be considered.
    (b) Length of activities. TASC proposals to fund activities that 
exceed three years will not be considered.
    (c) Target countries. Proposals may target all export markets, 
including single countries or reasonable regional groupings of 
countries.
    (d) Multiple proposals. Applicants may submit multiple proposals, 
but no TASC participant may have more than three approved projects 
underway at any given time.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.5  What is the process for submitting proposals?

    (a) General. To be considered for participation in the TASC, 
interested parties should submit proposals to: Director, Marketing 
Operations Staff, Foreign Agricultural Service, Room 4932-S, Stop 1042, 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, 
DC 20250-1042. Telephone: (202) 720-4327. Entities interested in 
participating in the TASC program are not required to submit proposals 
in any specific format, although interested

[[Page 794]]

parties can request a suggested format for proposals from the same 
address.
    (b) Contents of proposals. TASC proposals must contain complete 
information about the proposed projects, including, at a minimum, the 
following:
    (1) Organizational information, including:
    (i) Organization's name, address, Chief Executive Officer (or 
designee), and Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN);
    (ii) Type of organization;
    (iii) Name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the 
primary contact person;
    (iv) A description of the organization and its membership; and
    (v) A description of the organization's experience in technical 
assistance projects, including activities involved and project results.
    (2) Project information, including:
    (i) A brief project title;
    (ii) Request for funding;
    (iii) A market assessment, including a brief description of the 
specific export barrier to be addressed by the project;
    (iv) The goals of the project, and the expected benefits to the 
represented industry;
    (v) A description of the activities planned to address the export 
barrier;
    (vi) An itemized list of all estimated costs associated with the 
project for which reimbursement will be sought; and
    (vii) Information indicating all financial and in-kind support to 
the proposed project, and the resources to be contributed by each entity 
that will contribute to the project's implementation. This may include 
the organization that submitted the proposal, private industry entities, 
host governments, foreign third parties, CCC, FAS, or other Federal 
agencies. Support may include cash, goods, and services. Although highly 
encouraged, financial support from the participant is not required.
    (3) Export information, including:
    (i) Performance measures for three years, beginning with the year 
that the project would begin, which will be used to measure the 
effectiveness of the project;
    (ii) A benchmark performance measure for the year prior to the year 
that the project would begin; and
    (iii) The viability of long-term sales to this market.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.6  What are the criteria for evaluating proposals?

    (a) Evaluation criteria. FAS will use the following criteria in 
evaluating proposals:
    (1) The degree to which time is essential to addressing specific 
export barriers;
    (2) The nature of the specific export barrier and the extent to 
which the proposal is likely to successfully remove, resolve, or 
mitigate that barrier;
    (3) The impact of the proposed project on market retention, market 
access, and market expansion;
    (4) The completeness and viability of the proposal;
    (5) The ability of the organization to provide an experienced staff 
with the requisite technical and trade experience to execute the 
proposal;
    (6) The extent to which the proposal is targeted to a market in 
which the United States is generally competitive;
    (7) The potential for expanding commercial sales in the targeted 
market; and
    (8) The cost of the project and the amount of other resources 
dedicated to the project, including cash and goods and services of the 
U.S. industry and foreign third parties.
    (b) Evaluation process. FAS will review proposals for eligibility 
and will evaluate each proposal against the factors described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The purpose of this review is to identify 
meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each 
proposal based upon these factors, and submit the proposals and funding 
recommendations to the Deputy Administrator, Commodity and Marketing 
Programs. FAS may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the 
proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. government experts in 
evaluating the merits of a proposal.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.7  How are agreements formalized?

    Following approval of a proposal, CCC will enter into an agreement 
with

[[Page 795]]

the organization that submitted the proposal. TASC agreements will 
incorporate the proposal as approved by FAS, include a maximum amount 
that may be reimbursed, and identify terms and conditions pursuant to 
which CCC will reimburse certain costs of the project. TASC agreements 
will also outline any specific responsibilities of the participant, 
including, but not limited to, timely and effective implementation of 
technical assistance and submission of a written evaluation report 
within six months of completion of the project. Evaluation reports 
should address the performance measures presented in the proposal. TASC 
participants are also subject to the reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements described in 7 CFR part 3019, ``Uniform Administrative 
Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher 
Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-profit Organizations''.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.8  How does my organization apply for funds?

    CCC will publish a notice periodically in the Federal Register 
informing the public of the process by which interested organizations 
may apply for TASC program funding. This notice will, among other 
things, include information on any deadlines for submitting applications 
and the office where the applications should be sent.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.9  Can participants receive advance payments?

    (a) Reimbursement. Generally, after implementation of a TASC project 
for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, participants may submit 
claims for reimbursement of the costs associated with completing the 
project, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such costs. A TASC 
participant will be reimbursed after CCC reviews its claim and 
determines that the claim is complete. TASC projects will be subject to 
verification by the FAS Compliance Review Staff.
    (b) Advances. TASC participants may request advances of funds up to 
85 percent of the amount approved for funding. In such cases, 
reimbursement claims will be used to offset the advanced funds.
    (c) Interest. TASC participants must deposit and maintain advances 
in insured, interest-bearing accounts, unless such accounts are 
prohibited by law or custom of a host country. Interest earned on 
advances must be returned to CCC.

receivable and the bank obligation shall, at the option of the Assistant

commodity into such country as required. In such case, the financing 
agreement may be terminated by the Assistant Sales Manager, and if full 
payment under the bank obligation or account receivable has not yet been 
received, the bank obligation and the account receivable shall at the 
option of CCC, become due and payable and liquidated damages shall be 
payable in accordance with Sec. 1488.11. The remedy herein provided 
shall not be exclusive of other rights available to the Federal 
government if the commodity enters a country other than that specified 
in the financing agreement.

                          Delivery Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1488.11  Liquidated damages.

    Failure of the exporter to export or cause to be exported, within 
the period provided therefor, any agricultural commodity financed, when 
delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing 
agreement, or failure of the exporter to enter or cause the entry of, 
such commodity into the country of destination, shall constitute a 
breach of the financing agreement which will result in serious and 
substantial damage to CCC and to its program. Since it will be 
difficult, if not

[[Page 803]]

impossible, to prove the exact amount of such damage, the exporter shall 
pay to CCC promptly on demand, as reasonable compensation and not as a 
penalty, liquidated damages in lieu of probable actual damages, as 
follows:
    (a) For each day of delay in exportation after the final date for 
exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the 
financing agreement, .15 percent of the amount financed under the 
financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (b) for failure to 
export or cause exportation, when delivery is made before export under 
the terms of the financing agreement, 5 percent of the amount financed 
under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (c) for 
failure, after exportation, to enter or cause the entry of the commodity 
into the country of destination, at the rate of 5 percent a year of the 
amount financed under the financing agreement for such commodity from 
the start of the financing period until payment to CCC of the amount 
financed; Provided however, That the aggregate of all amounts assessed 
under this Sec. 1488.11 with respect to the same commodity shall not 
exceed 5 percent of the amount financed for such commodity. Liquidated 
damages shall not be assessed: Under paragraph (a) of this section if 
the Assistant Sales manager determines that the delay was due to such 
causes as acts of God or government or public enemy, fires, floods, 
epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, or 
unusually severe weather; under paragraph (b) of this section if the 
Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to export was due to 
loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of 
God or government or public enemy; and under paragraph (c) of this 
section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to enter 
or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination was 
due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or 
act of God or government or public enemy.

                     Bank Obligations and Repayment


<R05>
Sec. 1488.12  Coverage of bank obligations.

    (a) U.S. banks and branch banks shall be liable without regard to 
risk (1) for payment of bank obligations issued by them or (2) for 
payment of bank obligations confirmed by them without regard to risk if 
a requirement for such confirmation is included in the financing 
agreement or (3) as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (b) An obligation issued by a foreign bank must be confirmed and 
advised, as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this 
section, by a U.S. bank or a branch bank, or may be confirmed by an 
agency bank when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC 
after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of 
CCC.
    (c) A U.S. bank must confirm the full amount of an obligation issued 
by its foreign branch. CCC will hold the U.S. bank liable for payment 
without regard to risks.
    (d) If a branch bank confirms an obligation issued by its home 
office, or by another branch of its home office, it must confirm the 
full amount thereof. CCC will hold the branch bank liable for payment 
without regard to risks.
    (e) If CCC accepts an agency bank confirmation of a foreign bank 
obligation, it must be for the full amount thereof without regard to 
risks and will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be 
contained in the financing agreement. CCC will not accept an agency bank 
confirmation of an obligation issued by its home office, or by a branch 
of its home office.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this 
section, if a U.S. bank or a branch bank confirms an obligation issued 
by a foreign bank, it must confirm at least 10 percent pro rata and must 
advise the remainder of the foreign bank obligation. The percentage of 
confirmation shall be the same for both the account receivable and the 
interest portions of the obligation. For the confirmed amount, except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, CCC will hold the U.S. 
bank or

[[Page 804]]

branch bank liable for commercial risks but not for non-commercial 
risks. For the advised amount, CCC will not hold the U.S. bank or branch 
bank liable for commercial or non-commercial risks. CCC will hold the 
foreign bank liable without regard to risks for all amounts not 
recovered from the U.S. or branch bank.
    (g) Under special circumstances, on application in writing, the Vice 
President, CCC, may reduce or waive requirements for 10 percent 
confirmation by a U.S. or branch bank, but a bank will not be relieved 
of any obligation it undertakes.
    (h) Any bank obligation which provides for a bank acceptance of a 
time draft by CCC (banker's acceptance) shall not be acceptable to CCC.
    (i) CCC will consent to cancellation or reduction of a bank 
obligation to the extent of any payment it receives from other sources 
or amounts otherwise payable under such bank obligation.
    (j) Collection of accounts receivable purchased under GSM-5 will be 
effected through the issuance by CCC of sight drafts against the bank 
obligations, but this method of collection shall not be exclusive of any 
other collection procedures or rights available to CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1488.13  CCC drafts.

    CCC will draw one draft for each payment due under bank obligations. 
If any portion of a CCC draft is dishonored, the U.S. bank or branch 
bank shall return the dishonored draft together with its statement of 
the reason for nonpayment. If a draft which is drawn under a partially 
confirmed bank obligation is dishonored, CCC will replace the draft with 
separate drafts for the confirmed and unconfirmed portions at the 
request of the confirming bank. Such replacement shall not alter the 
confirming bank's obligation for timely payment to CCC of the confirmed 
portion of the credit. For confirmed amounts, except as provided in 
Sec. 1488.12(a), (c) and (d), a U.S. or branch bank may request refund 
from CCC of the amount paid if it certifies to CCC that it is unable to 
recover funds from the foreign bank due to a stipulated non-commercial 
risk which existed on the date payment was made to CCC under the draft. 
If CCC finds that inability to recover funds was due to such a non-
commercial risk, the refund shall be promptly made together with 
interest at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discount rate from and 
including the date payment was originally made to CCC but not include 
the date of refund by CCC. For unconfirmed amounts, remittance to CCC 
shall be considered final, and the U.S. bank or branch bank shall not 
thereafter have recourse to CCC.

FR 30833, June 17, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.14  Interest charges.

    The account receivable assigned to CCC and the related bank 
obligation(s) shall bear interest as specified in this section. Rates of 
interest applicable to financing agreements shall be published in USDA 
announcement. The interest rate applicable to that portion of an account 
receivable for which payment is assured by a bank obligation issued or 
confirmed for all risks according to Sec. 1488.12(a)(ii) or pro rata 
confirmed by a U.S. bank shall be lower than the interest rate 
applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest 
rate applicable to that portion of an account receivable the payment of 
which is assured by a bank obligation issued or pro rata confirmed by a 
branch bank shall, when determined by the President or Vice President, 
CCC after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest 
of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of 
the account receivable. The interest rates applicable to accounts 
receivable the payment of which is assured by an agency bank 
confirmation may, when determined by the President or Vice President, 
CCC, after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest 
of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of 
the account receivable. The interest rate applicable will be the rate in 
effect on the date CCC receives the sale registration request under 
Sec. 1488.4.

[[Page 805]]

Interest shall accrue on the account receivable from the date of 
delivery or the weighted average delivery date of the agricultural 
commodities delivered under the financing agreement to the date of 
payment, or to the date of expiration of the financing period, or to the 
date of expiration of the bank obligation, whichever occurs first, and 
shall be payable as specified in the financing agreement. Thereafter, 
interest shall accrue on any unpaid part of both the principal and 
interest due as of such expiration date.

[42 FR 10999, Feb. 25, 1977, as amended at 42 FR 27569, May 31, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.15  Advance payment.

    If, before expiration of the financing period, the exporter or the 
U.S. bank or the agency or branch bank accepts payment from or on behalf 
of the foreign importer of any part of the account receivable, it shall 
be remitted promptly to CCC. Such prepayment shall be applied first to 
interest on the unpaid balance of the account receivable to the date CCC 
receives such prepayment and then to the principal.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.16  Liability for payment.

    If delivery is made within the coverage of the bank obligation(s) 
submitted in accordance with Sec. 1488.8, CCC will look to the 
obligating bank or banks and the foreign importer, rather than to the 
exporter or intervening purchaser, for payment of all amounts due at 
maturity of the account receivable and of the bank obligation(s), but 
the exporter and the intervening purchaser shall remain liable for any 
loss arising from breach of any contractual obligation, certification or 
warranty made by them pursuant to the financing agreement, and the 
exporter shall remain liable for any amounts not covered by the bank 
obligation which are owing to CCC, and any remittance or refund required 
by Sec. 1488.15 and Sec. 1488.18, together with interest thereon at the 
rate specified in the documents evidencing the account receivable, as 
well as for any liquidated damages provided for in Sec. 1488.11. The 
liability of the bank and the importer under their respective 
obligations shall be several.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1488.17  Assignment.

    The exporter shall not assign any claim or rights or any amounts 
payable under the financing agreement, in whole or in part, without 
written approval of the Vice President, CCC, or the Controller, CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.18  Covenant against contingent fees.

    The exporter warrants that no person or selling agency has been 
employed or retained to solicit or secure the financing agreement on an 
agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or 
contingent fee, except bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty, 
CCC shall have the right, without limitation on any other rights it may 
have, to annul the financing agreement without liability to CCC. Should 
the financing agreement be annulled, CCC will promptly consent to the 
reduction or cancellation or related bank obligations except for amounts 
outstanding under a financing agreement. Such amounts shall, on demand, 
be refunded to CCC by the exporter.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.19  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.20  Officials not to benefit.

    No member of or delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, 
shall be admitted to any share or part of the financing agreement or to 
any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this provision shall not be 
construed to extend to the financing agreement if made with a 
corporation for its general benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.21  Exporter's records and accounts.

    CCC shall have access to and the right to examine any directly 
pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the exporter involving 
transactions related to the financed export credit sale until the 
expiration of three years after the end of the financing period.

[[Page 806]]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.22  Communications.

    (a) Unless otherwise provided, written requests, notifications, or 
communications by the applicant pertaining to the financing agreement 
shall be addressed to the Assistant Sales Manager, Commercial Export 
Programs, Office of the General Sales Manager, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.
    (b) [Reserved]

    Subpart A--Restrictions and Criteria for Export Credit Guarantee 
                                Programs


<R05>
Sec. 1493.1  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the restrictions which apply to the use of 
credit

[[Page 807]]

guarantees under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit 
Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate Credit Guarantee 
Program (GSM-103) and the criteria considered by CCC in determining the 
annual allocations of credit guarantees to be made available with 
respect to each participating country. This subpart also sets forth the 
criteria considered by CCC in the review and approval of proposed 
allocation levels for GSM-102 and/or GSM-103 credit guarantees which may 
be made available in connection with export sales of specific U.S. 
agricultural commodities to these countries. These restrictions and 
criteria are interrelated and will be applied and considered together in 
the process of determining which sales opportunities under GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 will best meet the purposes of the programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.2  Purposes of programs.

    CCC may use export credit guarantees:
    (a) To increase exports of U.S. agricultural commodities;
    (b) To compete against foreign agricultural exports;
    (c) To assist countries, particularly developing countries, in 
meeting their food and fiber needs; and
    (d) For such other purposes as the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines appropriate, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 1493.6.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.3  Restrictions on programs and cargo preference statement.

    (a) Restrictions on use of credit guarantees. (1) Export credit 
guarantees authorized under these regulations shall not be used for 
foreign aid, foreign policy, or debt rescheduling purposes.
    (2) CCC shall not make credit guarantees available in connection 
with sales of agricultural commodities to any country that the Secretary 
determines cannot adequately service the debt associated with such 
sales.
    (b) Cargo preference laws. The provisions of the cargo preference 
laws shall not apply to export sales with respect to which credit is 
guaranteed under these programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.4  Criteria for country allocations.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for country 
allocations under the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programs, will include, but not 
be limited to, the following:
    (a) Potential benefits that the extension of export credit 
guarantees would provide for the development, expansion or maintenance 
of the market for particular U.S. agricultural commodities in the 
importing country;
    (b) Financial and economic ability of the importing country to 
adequately service CCC guaranteed debt;
    (c) Financial status of participating banks in the importing country 
as it would affect their ability to adequately service CCC guaranteed 
debt;
    (d) Political stability of the importing country as it would affect 
its ability to adequately service CCC guaranteed debt; and
    (e) Current status of debt either owed by the importing country to 
CCC or to lenders protected by CCC's guarantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.5  Criteria for agricultural commodity allocations.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for specific 
U.S. commodity allocations within a specific country allocation will 
include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) Potential benefits that the extension of export credit 
guarantees would provide for the development, expansion or maintenance 
of the market in the importing country for the particular U.S. 
agricultural commodity under consideration;
    (b) The best use to be made of the export credit guarantees in 
assisting the importing country in meeting its particular needs for food 
and fiber, as may be determined through consultations with private 
buyers and/or representatives of the government of the importing 
country;
    (c) Evaluation, in terms of program purposes, of the relative 
benefits of providing payment guarantee coverage for sales of the U.S. 
agricultural commodity under consideration compared to providing 
coverage for sales of other U.S. agricultural commodities; and
    (d) Evaluation of the near and long term potential for sales on a 
cash basis

[[Page 808]]

of the U.S. commodity under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.6  Additional required determinations for GSM-103.

    Notwithstanding any other provision under this part, CCC shall not 
guarantee under the GSM-103 program the repayment of credit made 
available to finance an export sale unless the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines that such sale will:
    (a) Develop, expand or maintain the importing country as a foreign 
market, on a long-term basis, for the commercial sale and export of U.S. 
agricultural commodities, without displacing normal commercial sales;
    (b) Improve the capability of the importing country to purchase or 
use, on a long-term basis, U.S. agricultural commodities; or
    (c) Otherwise promote the export of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R04>
    Subpart B--CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and CCC 
    Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) Operations


<R05>
Sec. 1493.10  General statement.

    (a) Overview. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing 
the operations of the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the 
Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103). The GSM-102 and GSM-103 
programs of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were developed to 
expand U.S. agricultural exports by making available export credit 
guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing of foreign 
purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities on credit terms. Under GSM-
102, credit guarantees are issued for terms of up to three years. Under 
GSM-103, credit guarantees are issued for terms of from three to ten 
years.
    (2) The programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to 
increase or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private 
U.S. financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing 
without CCC's guarantee. The programs are operated in a manner intended 
not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs are targeted 
toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure 
financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial strength so 
that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In 
providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market 
opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term 
market development for U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (3) The credit facility created by these programs is the CCC payment 
guarantee. The payment guarantee is an agreement by CCC to pay the 
exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of 
the exporter's right to proceeds, specified amounts of principal and 
interest due from, but not paid by, the foreign bank issuing an 
irrevocable letter of credit in connection with the export sale to which 
CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, 
rather than governmental, financing and incurs a substantial portion of 
the risk of default by the foreign bank. CCC assumes this risk, in order 
to be able to operate the programs for the purposes specified in 
Sec. 1493.2.
    (b) Credit facility mechanism. Typically, in export sales of U.S. 
agricultural commodities, payment by the importer is made under an 
irrevocable letter of credit. For the purpose of the GSM-102 and GSM-103 
programs, CCC will consider applications for payment guarantees only in 
connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the 
payment for the agricultural commodities will be made in one of the two 
following ways:
    (1) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of 
the exporter, specifically stating the deferred payment terms under 
which the foreign bank is obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as 
such payments become due; or
    (2) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of 
the exporter, that is supported by a related obligation specifically 
stating the deferred payment terms under which the

[[Page 809]]

foreign bank is obligated to make payment to the exporter, or the 
exporter's assignee, in U.S. dollars as such payments become due. The 
exporter may assign the right to proceeds under the letter of credit or 
related obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that 
the exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred 
payment date(s) as set forth in the irrevocable foreign bank letter of 
credit or its related obligation. The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs are 
designed to protect the exporter or the exporter's assignee against 
those losses specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults, 
whether for commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the foreign bank 
obligated under the letter of credit or related obligation.
    (c) Program administration. The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs will be 
administered pursuant to this part and any Program Announcements and 
Notices to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent 
with, this part. These programs are under the general administrative 
responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS/USDA). The review and payment of claims for loss will be 
administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding 
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, 
and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular USDA or CCC offices, 
will be announced by a public press release (see Sec. 1493.20(c), 
``Contacts P/R'').
    (d) Country allocations and program announcements. From time to 
time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a GSM-102 and/or 
GSM-103 program allocation for a specific country. The Program 
Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific 
allocations for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof. 
Exporters may negotiate export sales to buyers in that country for one 
of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement and seek 
payment guarantee coverage within the dollar amounts of specified 
coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a 
requirement that the exporter's sales contract contain a shipping 
deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for a 
contractual shipping deadline will be stated in the Program 
Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified 
``undesignated'' or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that 
if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country 
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or 
``undesignated'' portion of the total country allocation may then be 
designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include 
an ``allocated'' or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain further 
information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion of the 
country allocation.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.20  Definition of terms.

    Terms set forth in this part, in CCC Program Announcements and 
Notices to Participants, and in any CCC-originated documents pertaining 
to the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs will have the following meanings:
    (a) Assignee. A financial institution in the United States which, 
for adequate consideration given, has obtained the legal rights to 
receive the payment of proceeds under the payment guarantee.
    (b) CCC. The Commodity Credit Corporation, an agency and 
instrumentality of the United States within the Department of 
Agriculture, authorized pursuant to the Commodity Credit Corporation

[[Page 813]]

Government programs, contracts or agreements; and
    (6) A certification that: ``I certify, to the best of my knowledge 
and belief, that neither [name of applicant] nor any of its principals 
has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment from contracting

guarantee may be submitted in writing or may be made by telephone, but, 
if made by telephone, it must be confirmed in writing to the office 
specified in the Contacts P/R. An application must identify the name and 
address of the exporter and include the following information:
    (1) Name of the destination country.
    (2) Name and address of the importer.
    (3) Name and address of the intervening purchaser, if any, and a

the price, as agreed between the exporter and the importer. If the 
commodity was sold on the basis of CFR or CIF, the actual (if known at 
the time of application) or estimated value of freight and, in the case 
of sales made on a CIF basis, the actual (if known at the time of 
application) or estimated value of marine and war risk insurance, must 
be specified.
    (10) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any.
    (11) Port value (includes upward loading tolerance, if any).
    (12) Guaranteed value.

between principal payments for each shipment to be made under the export 
sale.
    (16) A statement indicating whether any portion of the export sale 
for which the exporter is applying for a payment guarantee is also being 
used as the basis for an application for participation in any of the 
following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, Dairy 
Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or 
Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program. The number of the Agreement assigned 
by USDA under one of these programs should be included, as applicable.
    (17) Other information as specified in Notices to Participants, as 
applicable.
    (18) The exporter's statement, ``All Section 1493.50 Certifications 
Are Being Made In This Application'' which, when included in the

in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 1493.50.
    (b) An application for a payment guarantee may be approved as 
submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the exporter, or 
rejected by the GSM. In the event that the application is approved, the 
GSM will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time 
specified in Sec. 1493.60(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit 
sales price of the commodity does not fall within the prevailing 
commercial market level ranges, as determined by CCC, the application 
will not be approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.50  Certification requirements for obtaining payment guarantee.

    By providing the statement in Sec. 1493.40(a)(18), the exporter is 
certifying that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section 
have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide 
further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do 
not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application 
for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in 
Sec. 1493.40(a)(18), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the 
payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.20(z).
    (b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law;
    (c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable 
oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been 
or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, 
pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of 
any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity 
or product;
    (d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to 
solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement 
or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent 
fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.30 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.30, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications 
with respect to a GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, CCC will have 
the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, 
to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or 
to proceed against the exporter.

[59 FR 52876, Oct. 19, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 24561, May 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.60  Payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's obligation. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC 
agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to 
exceed the

[[Page 815]]

guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that the foreign 
bank fails to pay under the foreign bank letter of credit or the related 
obligation. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.
    (b) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to the period beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or on the 
date when interest begins to accrue, whichever is earlier, and will 
continue during the credit term specified in the payment guarantee or 
amendments thereto. However, the payment guarantee becomes effective on 
the date(s) of export(s) of the agricultural commodities or products 
thereof specified in the exporter's application for a payment guarantee.
    (c) Terms of the CCC payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's coverage 
will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the 
time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (d) Final date to export. The final date to export shown on the 
payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the 
contractual deadline for shipping.
    (e) Reserve coverage for loading tolerances. The exporter may apply 
for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee 
fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the 
export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC 
reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of 
the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If 
such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of 
application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so 
indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a 
quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid 
(i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage 
from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing 
for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional 
amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is 
not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the 
last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve 
the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.
    (f) Ineligible exports. Commodities with a date of export prior to 
the date of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written 
application for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after 
the final date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any 
amendments thereof, are ineligible for GSM-102 or GSM-103 guarantee 
coverage, except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best 
interests of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.
    (g) Foreign agricultural component. CCC may approve payment 
guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United 
States agricultural commodities as defined in Sec. 1493.20(z). CCC may 
not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for 
the value of any foreign agricultural component.
    (h) Additional requirements. The payment guarantee may contain such 
additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or 
desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (i) Amendments. A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee 
may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the 
assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the 
amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable 
Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may 
include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and 
an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, 
particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under 
the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. 
(Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be 
submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as 
amendments.)

[[Page 816]]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.70  Guarantee rates and fees.

    (a) Guarantee fee rates. The payment guarantee fee rates will be 
based upon the length of the payment terms provided for in the export 
sale contract, the degree of risk that CCC assumes, as determined by 
CCC, and any other factors which CCC determines appropriate for 
consideration. A current schedule of the guarantee fee rates charged by 
CCC under GSM-102 and GSM-103 will be available upon request from the 
FAS/USDA office specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (b) Calculation of fee. The guarantee fee will be computed by 
multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.
    (c) Payment of fee. The exporter shall remit, with his written 
application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not 
be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The 
exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and 
mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts 
P/R.
    (d) Refunds of fee. Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved 
applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the 
application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be 
made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be 
in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee 
is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage 
requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.80  Evidence of export.

    (a) Report of export. The exporter is required to provide CCC an 
evidence of export report for each shipment made under the payment 
guarantee. This report must include the following:
    (1) Payment guarantee number
    (2) Date of export
    (3) Exporter's sale number
    (4) Exported value
    (5) Quantity
    (6) A full description of the commodity exported
    (7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the 
basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price at export 
differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, the exporter is also required to 
submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference.
    (8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any.
    (9) Number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under another program 
if any portion of the export sale was also approved for participation in 
the following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, 
Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or 
Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program.
    (10) The exporter's statement, ``All Sec. 1493.90 Certifications Are 
Being Made In This Evidence Of Export'' which, when included in the 
evidence of export by the exporter, will constitute a certification that 
it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 1493.90.
    (b) Time limit for submission of evidence of export. The exporter 
must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/
R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 
calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period 
for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of 
the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of 
export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, 
the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the 
extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely 
to result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the 
program;
    (3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or
    (4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for 
submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such 
extension is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.
    (c) Export sales reporting. Exporters may have a mandatory reporting 
responsibility under Section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 
(7 U.S.C. 5712), as amended by Section 1531 of the Food, Agriculture, 
Conservation, and

[[Page 817]]

Trade Act of 1990 for exports of wheat and wheat flour, feed grains, 
oilseeds, cotton, and other agricultural commodities and products 
thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.90  Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

    By providing the statement contained in Sec. 1493.80(a)(10), the 
exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of 
export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements 
set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be 
required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to 
reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or 
violates these certifications with respect to a GSM-102 or GSM-103 
payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other 
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any 
commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The 
exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the 
statement set forth in Sec. 1493.80(a)(10), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment 
guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.20(z).
    (b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity 
called for in the exporter's sales contract with the importer have been 
exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee;
    (c) A letter of credit has been opened in favor of the exporter by 
the foreign bank shown in the payment guarantee to cover the port value 
of the commodity exported;
    (d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.30 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.30 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is 
a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements.

Sec. 1493.100  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of commodities covered by a GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 payment guarantee to a country other than that shown on the 
payment guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.
    (b) Records of proof of entry. Exporters must obtain and maintain 
records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant 
authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be 
necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programs in the 
country that was the intended country of destination of such 
commodities. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be in English or 
be accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable to CCC. 
Records acceptable to meet this requirement include an original 
certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs or port 
official of the importing country, by the importer, by an agent or 
representative of the vessel or shipline which delivered the 
agricultural commodity to the importing country, or by a private 
surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation deemed 
acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (1) That the agricultural commodity entered the importing country;
    (2) The identification of the export carrier;
    (3) The quantity of the agricultural commodity;
    (4) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the agricultural 
commodity; and
    (5) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the agricultural 
commodity in the importing country. [Records of proof of entry need not 
be submitted with a claim for loss, except as may be provided in 
Sec. 1493.110(b)(4)(ii).]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.110  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms

[[Page 818]]

of the foreign bank letter of credit or related obligation, the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as 
soon as possible, but not later than 10 calendar days after the date 
that payment was due from the foreign bank (the due date). A notice of 
default must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the 
address specified in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with 
this paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with 
respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit 
may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if such 
extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best 
interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the country;
    (3) Name of the defaulting bank;
    (4) Due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately 
the amounts for principal and interest;
    (6) Date of foreign bank's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for foreign bank's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must 
be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified 
in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following 
information and documents:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the foreign 
bank obligation applicable to the claim;
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i)(A) The foreign bank letter of credit securing the export sale; 
and
    (B) If applicable, the document(s) evidencing the related obligation 
owed by the foreign bank to the assignee financial institution which is 
related to the foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such related obligation must be demonstrated in one of the 
following ways:
    (1) The related obligation, including a specific promise to pay on 
deferred payment terms, may be contained in the letter of credit as a 
special instruction from the issuing bank directly to the U.S. financial 
institution to refinance the amounts paid by the U.S. financial 
institution for obligations financed according to the tenor of the 
letter of credit; or
    (2) The related obligation may be memorialized in a separate 
document(s) specifically identified and referred to in the letter of 
credit as the agreement under which the foreign bank is obliged to repay 
the U.S. financial institution on deferred payment terms; or
    (3) The letter of credit payment obligations may be specifically 
identified in a separate document(s) setting forth the related 
obligation, or in a duly executed amendment thereto, as having been 
financed by the U.S. financial institution pursuant to, and subject to 
repayment in accordance with the terms of, such related obligation; or
    (4) The related obligation may be memorialized in the form of a 
promissory note executed by the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit in favor of the U.S. financial institution submitting the claim;
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the importing country;
    (iii)(A) The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, 
FOB, CFR or CIF values; or
    (B) If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's 
invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's 
invoice to the importer;

[[Page 819]]

    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default 
under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the 
applicable foreign bank letter of credit and the related obligation, if 
applicable; and
    (v) A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the 
exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.80(a).
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. If the initial 
claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee 
need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial 
claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating 
to failure of the foreign bank to make scheduled installments on the 
same export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only 
submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated 
in paragraph (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of 
subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including 
the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.120  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.110, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable 
supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC 
determines that it is liable to the exporter and/or the exporter's 
assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. CCC's maximum liability for any 
claims for loss submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not 
including any late interest payments due in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus 
eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export, 
plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the day of reciept of a claim found 
by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date 
that payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the 
guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section, and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the 
Department of Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the 
foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed by the foreign 
bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the 
foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the exporter, unless 
it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC by the Controller, 
CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the 
entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default 
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition 
to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a 
payment guarantee, CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take 
any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, 
omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has no 
knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Sec. 1493.80 and Sec. 1493.90, excluding post-export adjustments (i.e., 
corrections to evidence of export reports); and

[[Page 820]]

    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.110.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.130  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights 
under the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer, the foreign bank, or any other source whatsoever, such 
monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies 
are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of 
recovery by the exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery 
to the date of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of 
payment by the exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest 
will be charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment 
guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the 
holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided 
that the required information necessary for determining pro rata 
distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 
business days from the date of recovery or 15 business days from 
receiving the required information for determining pro rata 
distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and such interest will accrue from such date to the 
date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of 
the recovery payable to the holder of the payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the 
exporter, the exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will 
be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to 
CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such 
recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on 
a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest 
in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 payment guarantee, CCC prorates any collections it receives and 
shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the 
guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been 
reimbursed in full. Appendix A to Sec. 1493.130--Illustration of Pro 
Rata Allocation of Recoveries--provides an example of the methodology 
used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts 
paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by 
CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in 
material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee 
or for fulfilling obligations under GSM-102 or GSM-103. Further, the 
exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC 
under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the 
exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program 
requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Sec. 1493.50(b) and Sec. 1493.90(d) or the failure of an exporter to 
comply with the provisions of Sec. 1493.100 or Sec. 1493.140(e) will not 
affect the validity of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee 
which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the 
time such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of 
assignment of the payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter

[[Page 821]]

or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will 
cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the foreign bank and/or the 
importer.

  Appendix A to Sec. 1493.130--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.130(c), regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for 
claims filed under the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs. A typical case 
might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit 
arrangement with the foreign bank calling for equal annual payments of 
principal and annual payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per 
annum and a penalty interest rate of 12 percent per annum on overdue 
amounts until the overdue amount is paid.
    2. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of 
$100,000 and an interest payment of $10,000, both due on January 31.
    3. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a claim in good order with 
CCC.
    4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
98 percent of the principal amount due ($98,000) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 98 percent of the principal 
($7,840).
    5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    6. The latest bond equivalent rate of the 52-week Treasury bill 
auction average which has been published by the Department of Treasury 
in effect on the date of nonpayment (January 31) is 9 percent. The 
latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury Bill auction average which 
has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect on the date 
of nonpayment by CCC (February 11) is 7 percent.

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the payment 
guarantee would be computed as follows:
    1. CCC's Obligation under the Payment Guarantee:

 
 
 
(a).............................  Principal coverage-- $98,000.00
                                   (98% x $100,000).
(b).............................  Interest coverage--  $7,840.00
                                   (8% x $98,000).
                                                      ------------------
                                                       $105,840.00
(c).............................  Late interest due    $223.28
                                   from CCC (7% per
                                   annum for 11 days
                                   x $105,840).
                                                      ------------------
(d).............................  Amount paid by CCC   $106,063.28
                                   on February 22.
 

    2. Foreign Bank's Obligation under the Letter of Credit or the 
Related Obligation:

 
 
 
(a).............................  Principal due        $100,000.00
                                   January 31.
                                  Interest due         $10,000.00
                                   January 31 (10% x
                                   $100,000).
                                                      ------------------
 
                                  Amount owed by       $110,000.00
                                   foreign bank as of
                                   January 31.
(b).............................  Penalty interest     $795.62
                                   due (12% per annum
                                   for 22 days x
                                   $100,000).
                                                      ------------------
(c).............................  Amount owed by       $110,795.62
                                   foreign bank as of
                                   February 22.
 

    3. Amount of Foreign Bank's Obligation Not Covered by CCC's Payment 
Guarantee: $4,668.55

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the foreign bank obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the foreign bank is 
$110,000, CCC would be entitled to 95.75 percent ($106,063.07 divided by 
$110,765.62) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be entitled 
to 4.21 percent ($4,668.55 divided by $110,795.62) of any recoveries of 
losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this example, the losses 
were recovered after the claim has been paid by CCC, Sec. 1493.130(b) 
would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.140  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to 
such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment 
must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already 
paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless 
approved in advance by CCC, be:
    (i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties or
    (ii) Subject to further assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases

[[Page 822]]

where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive 
an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC 
will provide notice thereof, to the financial institution and to the 
exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of an acknowledgment of 
assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC; or
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial institution:
    (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in 
sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees. CCC may, with 
the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under 
the payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the 
exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for 
the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other 
than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those 
alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in 
rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the 
payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the 
amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment 
guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, must 
maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and 
deliveries of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with a GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, 
including those records generated and maintained by agents, intervening 
purchasers, and related companies involved in special arrangements with 
the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General 
of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be 
given full and complete access to the premises of the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from 
the effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such 
five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the 
exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's or 
related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions 
relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, 
financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, 
processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and 
unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized 
representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside 
the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain 
directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in 
connection with the payment guarantee.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by 
Sec. 1493.100(b),

[[Page 823]]

and must provide access to such documentation if requested by the 
Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the five-
year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and Notices to 
Participants relating to the GSM-102 or GSM-103 program, as applicable. 
Applicants for payment guarantees under these programs are hereby on 
notice that they will be bound by any terms contained in applicable 
Program Announcements or Notices to Participants issued prior to the 
date of approval of a payment guarantee.
    (g) Submission of documents by principal officers. All required 
submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or 
requests (i.e., requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' 
assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of 
the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In

    (h) Officials not to benefit. No member of or delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the 
payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this 
provision shall not be construed to extend to the payment guarantee if 
made with a corporation for its general benefit.

sector ownership of the project;
    (25) The exporter's signature.
    (b) Application fee. The exporter shall pay the application fee 
specified in the program announcement at the time the application is 
submitted. An application will not be considered without payment of the 
specified fee. The application fee is nonrefundable.
    (c) Letter of preliminary commitment. CCC will determine whether, in 
its judgment, the project in connection with which the exporter seeks a 
facility payment guarantee is likely to increase exports of U.S. 
agricultural commodities or products to an emerging market; and whether 
the project is likely to benefit primarily U.S. agricultural commodities 
or products as opposed to commodities or products originating in other 
countries. If necessary, CCC may seek additional information from an 
applicant prior to making its determination. If CCC determines that an 
application meets these standards and appears to represent, in CCC's 
judgment, the best use of available resources, CCC will respond to the 
applicant with a letter of preliminary commitment indicating CCC's 
interest in issuing a facility payment guarantee conditioned on its 
approval of the exporter's final application.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.250  Final application and issuance of a facility payment guarantee.

    (a) Final application. An exporter who has received a letter of 
preliminary commitment may, within six months of the date of such 
letter, submit a final application to CCC for a facility payment 
guarantee which shall include the following information:
    (1) A cover sheet with the title: ``Application for a Facility 
Payment Guarantee--Final Commitment.''
    (2) A letterhead statement from the importer's bank or other 
documentation confirming the importer has the financial ability to 
comply with the initial payment requirement in Sec. 1493.230(c);
    (3) Written evidence of a firm sale signed by the exporter and the 
importer, specifying at minimum, the following information: Goods or 
services to be exported, quantities of such items, delivery terms (e.g., 
FOB, CFR, CIF), delivery period(s), contract value, payment terms, and 
date of sale. A sales contract may be contingent upon obtaining a 
facility payment guarantee;
    (4) A description of any changes in the information submitted in the 
preliminary application; and
    (5) The exporter's signature;
    (b) Additional information. CCC shall have the right to request the 
exporter to furnish any other information and documentation it deems 
pertinent to the evaluation of the exporter's final application for a 
final commitment.

[[Page 828]]

CCC may request from the exporter an independent engineering study or 
economic feasibility study relating to the project.
    (c) Final commitment letter. After making a favorable determination 
on the exporter's submissions, CCC will issue a final commitment letter 
indicating the applicable exposure fee rate and stating that CCC is 
prepared to issue a facility payment guarantee upon receiving full 
payment of the exposure fee within an allotted time. The letter will 
also indicate the key terms and coverage of the guarantee to be issued. 
CCC will also inform exporters in writing when it denies their request 
for a facility payment guarantee.
    (d) Exposure fee. The exposure fee is calculated by multiplying the 
requested guaranteed value (up to the maximum established by CCC's final 
commitment letter) by the exposure fee rate. Once the facility payment 
guarantee is issued to the exporter, CCC will ordinarily not refund the 
exposure fee. If CCC does not issue a facility payment guarantee, or 
issues a guarantee for only part of the coverage requested, CCC will 
make a full or pro rata refund of the exposure fee, as appropriate.
    (e) Issuance of the facility payment guarantee. Upon receipt of the 
exposure fee, CCC will issue a facility payment guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.260  Facility payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's maximum obligation. CCC will agree to pay the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee an amount not to exceed the guaranteed value 
stipulated on the face of the facility payment guarantee, plus eligible 
interest, in the event that the foreign bank fails to pay under the 
foreign bank letter of credit or related obligation. The exact amount of 
CCC's liability in the event of default will be determined in accordance 
with Sec. 1493.310(b).
    (b) Calculation of maximum guarantee coverage. CCC will determine 
the maximum amount of its obligation under a facility payment guarantee 
by calculating a:
    (1) Net contract value equal to the contract value minus:
    (i) The value of goods that are not U.S. goods; and
    (ii) The cost of services that are not U.S. services (except those 
services the exporter requests CCC to determine are vital to the success 
of the project and approved to be included in the net contract value);
    (2) Facility base value equal to net contract value minus:
    (i) The amount to be paid in accordance with the initial payment 
requirement in Sec. 1493.230(c); and
    (ii) The amount of discounts and allowances; and
    (3) Maximum guaranteed value equal to:
    (i) A principal amount determined by multiplying the facility base 
value (as determined in Sec. 1493.260(b)(2)) by the guaranteed 
percentage specified in the program announcement; and
    (ii) Interest on such principal amount at the rate specified in the 
applicable program announcement, not to exceed the investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 52-week bill auction in effect at that time.
    (c) Value and cost. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Value means declared customs value of the goods; or, in the 
absence of specific information regarding declared customs value, the 
fair market wholesale value of the imported goods in the United States 
at the time they were acquired by the participant; and
    (2) Cost means actual amount paid by the exporter for the services 
in an arms-length transaction; or in the absence of an arms-length 
transaction, the fair market value of the services at the time the 
services were provided.
    (d) U.S. content test. (1) CCC will issue a guarantee only if the 
following items collectively represent less than 50 percent of the net 
contract value in Sec. 1493.260(b)(1):
    (i) The value of imported components (except for raw materials) that 
are assembled, processed, or manufactured into U.S. goods included in 
the net contract value;
    (ii) The cost of services that are not U.S. services (including 
freight on foreign flag carriers and transportation insurance registered 
with foreign agents) that, at the request of the exporter, CCC 
determines are vital to the success of the project and approves

[[Page 829]]

their inclusion in the net contract value;
    (2) For purpose of this subsection, minor or cosmetic procedures 
(e.g., affixing labels, cleaning, painting, polishing) do not qualify as 
assembling, processing or manufacturing;
    (3) For purpose of this subsection, local services which involve 
costs for hotels, meals, transportation, and other similar services 
incurred in the emerging market are not U.S. services.
    (e) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to the period beginning on the date(s) of export(s) and will continue 
during the credit term specified in the facility payment guarantee. For 
goods, the period of coverage will also apply from the date on which 
interest begins to accrue, if earlier than the date of export. The final 
payments of principal and interest by the foreign bank must come due 
within the period of guarantee coverage.
    (f) Terms of the CCC facility payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's 
coverage will be set forth in the facility payment guarantee and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
program announcement(s) or notice(s) to participants in effect at the 
time the facility payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (g) Final date to export. The final date to export will be stated in 
the facility payment guarantee.
    (h) Ineligible exports. Goods or services with a date of export 
prior to the date CCC issues the facility payment guarantee are 
ineligible for coverage unless approved by the GSM.
    (i) Additional requirements. The facility payment guarantee may 
contain such additional terms, conditions, and limitations as are deemed 
necessary or desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the facility payment guarantee, are binding 
on the exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (j) Amendments. Exporters must notify CCC of any amendments 
concerning contracts covered by a facility payment guarantee. CCC will 
determine if the contract amendments will require amendments to the 
facility payment guarantee. Amending the facility payment guarantee may 
result in an increase to the exposure fee. Requests made by the exporter 
to amend the facility payment guarantee so as to change the guaranteed 
value must have the concurrence of the assignee when an assignment has 
been made.
    (k) Effective date. The facility payment guarantee shall become 
effective on the date of export of the goods or services.

Appendix to Sec. 1493.260--Illustration of FGP Coverage of Imported Raw 
     Materials, Components, and Services That Are Not U.S. Services

    The following example illustrates CCC's regulations and policy 
options with regard to issuing a payment guarantee for a project which 
includes imported raw materials, imported components, and services that 
are not U.S. services:
    1. Ten grain trucks and one truck scale are to be exported from the 
U.S. to an emerging market. The trucks will provide the ability to 
purchase larger quantities of grain from the U.S. The contract value 
totals $2,025,000, cost, insurance and freight (CIF) basis.
    2. The fenders, hoods and doors of the trucks have been manufactured 
and assembled in the U.S. and contain some imported raw materials (sheet 
metal).
    3. Imported components consist of starters and alternators, with a 
U.S. customs valuation of $149,000. These items are installed into the 
trucks in the U.S.
    4. The truck scale was imported from Canada into the U.S. with a 
U.S. customs valuation of $20,000.
    5. A U.S. citizen, will travel on a foreign airline carrier to the 
emerging market (airfare is $1,000) to instruct mechanics in repair and 
maintenance of the trucks. He will be paid a salary for this service 
and, in addition, will be reimbursed separately for local costs in the 
emerging market (e.g., hotel, meals, transportation) which are estimated 
to be $5,000.
    6. The trucks are to be shipped on foreign flag vessels, and the 
marine insurance is to be placed with a foreign agent. The combined cost 
of these services that are not U.S. services for which the exporter 
seeks coverage is estimated to be $500,000.

          CCC's Approval of Services That Are Not U.S. Services

    CCC agrees to include in the net contract value the foreign flag 
freight and marine insurance ($500,000) and the airfare ($1,000) of the 
U.S. instructor (Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)).

                    Calculation of Net Contract Value

    CCC will calculate the net contract value by subtracting from the 
contract value

[[Page 830]]

($2,025,000) the U.S. customs value of the truck scale ($20,000) in 
accordance with Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)(I) and the local costs to be 
incurred by the U.S. instructor ($5,000) in accordance with 
Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)(ii) to equal $2,000,000.

             CCC's Determination of U.S. Content Eligibility

    The imported components and services that are not U.S. services 
approved for coverage total $650,000 (i.e., $149,000 for starters and 
alternators, $1,000 for airfare, $500,000 for freight and insurance; or 
32.5 percent of the net contract value of $2,000,000 
(Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)). Since this is less than 50 percent of the net 
contract value the transaction meets the U.S. content test 
(Sec. 1493.260(d)).


<R05>
Sec. 1493.270  Certifications.

    (a) Exporter's signature. The exporter's signature on documentation 
submitted to CCC under this subpart, is the exporter's certification 
that:

violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or 
other U.S. Laws;
    (2) All information submitted to CCC is true and correct; and
    (3) The exporter is in compliance with this subpart.
    (b) False certification. False certifications under this subpart may 
result in the termination of the facility payment guarantee, suspension 
or debarment, or civil or criminal action.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.280  Evidence of export report.

    (a) Report of export. The exporter is required to provide CCC an 
evidence of export report for each shipment of goods or provision of 
services covered under the facility payment guarantee. Each report must 
be numbered in chronological order and contain the following information 
in the order prescribed below:
    (1) The facility payment guarantee number;
    (2) The date goods or services were exported or provided;

    (10) Written statements that:
    (i) The goods exported or services provided were included in the

<R05>
Sec. 1493.300  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the foreign bank 
letter of credit or related obligation, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but 
not later than ten days after the date that payment was due from the 
foreign bank (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in 
writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts 
P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's assignee fails to promptly notify 
CCC of defaults in accordance with this paragraph, CCC may make the 
facility payment guarantee null and void with respect to any payment(s) 
applicable to such default. This time limit may be extended only under 
extraordinary circumstances and if approved by the Controller, CCC. The 
notice of default must include:
    (1) Facility payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the emerging market;

    (6) Date of foreign bank's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for the foreign bank's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's

[[Page 832]]

assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six months from the 
due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must be submitted in 
writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts 
P/R. The claim for loss must include the following information and 
documents:
    (1) Facility payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue and the interest rate on the foreign 
bank obligation applicable to the claim; and
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i)(A) The foreign bank's letter of credit securing the export sale, 
and;
    (B) If applicable, the document(s) evidencing the related obligation 
owed by the foreign bank to the assignee financial institution which is 
related to the foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the 
exporter.
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill; 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the emerging market;
    (iii) The exporter's sales invoice(s) showing the value and basis of

    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default. 
The instrument must reference the applicable foreign bank letter of 
credit and the related obligation, if applicable; and
    (v) A copy of the evidence of export report(s) previously submitted 
by the exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.280.
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. The exporter or 
an exporter's assignee need only provide one claim which meets full 
documentation requirements relating to a covered transaction. For 
subsequent claims relating to such failures of the foreign bank to make 
scheduled installments on the same export, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure 
containing the information stated in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (3) of 
this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) 
of this section, and the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.310  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.300, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the facility payment guarantee, this subpart, program 
announcement(s) and notice(s) to participants. If CCC determines that it 
is liable to the exporter or the exporter's assignee, CCC will pay the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee in accordance with paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. CCC's maximum liability for any 
claims for loss submitted with respect to any facility payment 
guarantee, not including any late interest payments due in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the facility payment 
guarantee, plus eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the facility payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export 
report (Sec. 1493.280(a)(7)), plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the claim was found by CCC to be in 
good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is 
made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount,

[[Page 833]]

as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will be 
calculated based on the latest average investment rate of the most 
recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department of 
Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the 
foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed by the foreign 
bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the 
foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the exporter, unless 
it is determined to be in the best interest of CCC by the Controller, 
CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the 
entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default 
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition 
to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to the value of goods or 
services covered by a facility payment guarantee, CCC will not hold the 
assignee responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the 
assignee for any action, omission or statement by the exporter of which 
the assignee has no knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Sec. 1493.270 and Sec. 1493.280 excluding post-export adjustments (i.e., 
corrections of evidence of export reports); and
    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.300.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.320  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights 
under the subrogation agreement to recover all monies in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer, the foreign bank or any other source whatsoever, such 
monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies 
are not received by CCC within 15 days from the date of recovery by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date 
of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest 
average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day auction, as 
announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of 
recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be 
charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a facility 
payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay 
the holder of the facility payment guarantee its pro rata share 
immediately, provided that the required information necessary for 
determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not 
made by CCC within 15 days from the date of recovery or 15 days from 
receiving the required information for determining pro rata 
distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of 
payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the 
recovery payable to the holder of the facility payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the 
exporter, the exporter's assignee or any other source whatsoever, will 
be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to 
CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such 
recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on 
a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest 
in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a facility 
payment

[[Page 834]]

guarantee, CCC prorates any collections it receives and shares these 
collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both 
CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. 
Appendix to Sec. 1493.320 provides an example of the methodology used by 
CCC in applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
facility payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any 
amounts paid by CCC under the facility payment guarantee when and if it 
is determined by CCC that the exporter engaged in fraud, or has been or 
is in breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the facility payment 
guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under the FGP. Further, the 
exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC 
under the facility payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC 
that the exporter's assignee engaged in fraud or otherwise violated 
program requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Sec. 1493.270 or the failure of an exporter to comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 1493.290 or Sec. 1493.330(e) will not affect the 
validity of any facility payment guarantee with respect to an assignee 
which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the 
time such exporter applied for the facility payment guarantee or at the 
time of assignment of the facility payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the foreign 
bank or the importer.

   Appendix to Sec. 1493.320--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.320, regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for claims 
filed under the FGP. For the purpose of this example only, even though 
CCC interest coverage is on a floating rate basis, a constant rate of 
interest is assumed. A typical case might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit 
arrangement for the export sale of goods and services with the foreign 
bank calling for equal semi-annual payments of principal and semi-annual 
payment of interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum and a penalty 
interest rate of 12 percent per annum on overdue amounts until the 
overdue amount is paid.
    2. Exported value reported to CCC equals $300,000.
    3. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of 
$50,000 and an interest payment of $2,493.15, both due on January 31.
    4. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a notice of default and claim 
in good order with CCC.
    5. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
95 percent of the principal amount due ($47,500) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 95 percent of the principal 
($1,894.80).
    6. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    7. The latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury Bill auction 
average which has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect 
on the date of nonpayment by CCC (February 11) is 7 percent.

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the facility 
payment guarantee would be computed as follows:

1. CCC's Obligation under the Facility Payment Guarantee:
    (a) Principal coverage--(95% x $50,000)................   $47,500.00
    (b) Interest coverage--(8% x $47,500 x 182/365)........     1,894.80
                                                            ------------
        Total..............................................    49,394.80
    (c) Late interest due from CCC (7% per annum for 11           104.20
     days x $49,394.80)....................................
                                                            ------------
    (d) Amount paid by CCC on February 22..................    49,499.00
                                                            ============
2. Foreign Bank's Obligation under the Letter of Credit or
 the Related Obligation:
    (a) Principal due January 31...........................    50,000.00
        Interest due January 31 (10% x $ 50,000 x 182/365).     2,493.15
                                                            ------------
        Amount owed by foreign bank as of January 31.......    52,493.15
    (b) Penalty interest due (12% per annum for 22 days x $       361.64
     50,000)...............................................
                                                            ------------
    (c) Amount owed by foreign bank as of February 22......    52,854.79
3. Amount of Foreign Bank's Obligation Not Covered by CCC's    3,355.79.
 Payment Guarantee:........................................
 


[[Page 835]]

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the foreign bank obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the foreign bank is 
$52,854.79, CCC would be entitled to 93.65 percent ($49,499.00 divided 
by $52,854.79) and the holder of the facility payment guarantee would be 
entitled to 6.35 percent ($3,355.79 divided by $52,854.79) of any 
recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this 
example, the losses were recovered after the claim had been paid by CCC, 
Sec. 1493.320(b) would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.330  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a facility payment guarantee or the 
right to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The 
assignment must cover all amounts payable under the facility payment 
guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and 
may not, unless approved in advance by CCC, be subject to further 
assignment. Any assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee 
for two or more parties participating in the assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be 
ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, CCC will provide notice thereof to such financial 
institution and to the exporter issued the facility payment guarantee in 
lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a facility payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC; or
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a facility payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial 
institution:
    (1) At the time of assignment of a facility payment guarantee, is 
not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of facility payment guarantees. CCC 
may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds 
payable under the facility payment guarantee has been assigned, with the 
agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms or 
conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a facility 
payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC 
determines that those alternative procedures, terms or conditions are 
appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction 
covered by the facility payment guarantee and would not result in CCC 
paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a facility 
payment guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as 
applicable, must maintain and make available all records pertaining to 
sales

[[Page 836]]

and deliveries of and extension of credit for goods or services exported 
in connection with a facility payment guarantee, including those records 
generated and maintained by agents, and related companies involved in 
special arrangements with the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and 
the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized 
representatives, must be given full and complete access to the premises 
of the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, during 
regular business hours from the effective date of the facility payment 
guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, 
examine, audit, and make copies of the exporter's, exporter's 
assignee's, or a related company's books, records, and accounts 
concerning transactions relating to the facility payment guarantee, 
including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts pertaining 
to sales, inventory, manufacturing, processing, and administrative and 
incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by 
Sec. 1493.290(b), and must provide access to such document if requested 
by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the 
five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, this subpart, program announcement(s), and notice(s) to 
participants relating to the FGP, as applicable. Applicants for facility 
payment guarantees under this program are hereby on notice that they 
will be bound by any terms contained in applicable program 
announcement(s) or notice(s) to participants issued prior to the date of 
approval of a facility payment guarantee.
    (g) Submission of documents by principal officers. All required 
submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or 
requests (i.e., requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' 
assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of 
the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In 
cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal or the 
officer, the signature must be accompanied by:
    (1) Wording indicating the delegation of authority or, in the 
alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority; and
    (2) The name and title of the authorized person or officer. Further, 
the exporter or exporter's assignee must ensure that all information/
reports required under this subpart are submitted within the required 
time limits. If requested in writing, CCC will acknowledge receipt of a 
submission by the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment 
of receipt is requested, the exporter or exporter's assignee must submit 
an extra copy of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope for 
return by U.S. mail. If courier services are desired for the return 
receipt, the exporter or exporter's assignee must also submit a self-
addressed courier service order which includes the recipient's billing 
code for such service.
    (h) Officials not to benefit. No member of or delegate to Congress, 
or resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the 
facility payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, 
but this provision shall not be construed to extend to the facility 
payment guarantee if made with a corporation for its general benefit.
    (i) Deadlines. (1) Where a deadline is fixed in terms of days, it 
means business days and excludes Saturdays, Sundays and federal 
holidays.
    (2) Where a deadline is fixed in terms of months, the deadline falls 
on the same day of the month as the day triggering the deadline period, 
or if there is no same day, the last day of the month; and
    (3) Where a deadline would otherwise fall on a Saturday, Sunday or 
federal holiday, the deadline shall be the next business day.

<R05>
Sec. 1493.400  General statement.

    (a) Overview. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing 
the operations of the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP). The 
restrictions and criteria set forth at subpart A for the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and 
the Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) will apply to this 
subpart. The SCGP was developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by 
making available payment guarantees to encourage U.S. exporters to 
extend financing on credit terms of not more than 180 days to importers 
of U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (2) The SCGP operates in cases where credit is necessary to increase 
or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private U.S. 
exporters would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's 
guarantee. The program is operated in a manner intended not to interfere 
with markets for cash sales. The program is targeted toward those 
countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the 
exports but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign 
exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this 
credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for 
U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for 
U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (3) The credit facility created by this program is the SCGP payment 
guarantee (payment guarantee). The payment guarantee is an agreement by 
CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take 
assignment of the exporter's right to proceeds, specified amounts of 
principal and, where applicable, interest due from, but not paid by, the 
importer incurring the obligation in connection with the export sale to 
which CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, 
rather than government, financing and incurs a substantial portion of 
the risk of default by the importer. CCC assumes this risk, in order to 
be able to operate the program for the purposes specified in 
Sec. 1493.2.
    (b) Credit facility mechanism. (1) For the purpose of the SCGP, CCC 
will consider applications for payment guarantees only in connection 
with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for 
the agricultural commodities will be made under an unconditional and 
irrevocable importer obligation to a U.S. exporter payable in U.S. 
dollars, as defined in Sec. 1493.410(n).
    (2) The exporter may assign the right to proceeds under the importer 
obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the 
exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred 
payment date(s) as set forth in the importer obligation.
    (3) The SCGP payment guarantee is designed to protect the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment 
guarantee resulting from defaults, whether for commercial or 
noncommercial reasons, by the importer under the importer's obligation.
    (c) Program administration. The SCGP will be administered pursuant 
to subpart A and this subpart and any Program Announcements and Notices 
to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent with, 
this subpart. This program is under the general administrative 
responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS/USDA). The review and payment of claims for loss will be 
administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding 
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, 
and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular USDA or CCC offices, 
will be announced by a public press release (see Sec. 1493.410(c), 
``Contacts P/R'').
    (d) Country allocations and program announcements. From time to 
time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a SCGP 
allocation for a specific country. The Program Announcement for a 
country allocation will designate specific allocations for U.S. 
agricultural commodities or products thereof, will indicate the form of 
promissory note required by CCC, and will provide other pertinent 
information. Exporters may negotiate export sales to importers in that 
country for one of the commodities specified in the

[[Page 838]]

Program Announcement and seek payment guarantee coverage within the 
dollar amounts of specified coverage for that commodity. The Program 
Announcement will contain a requirement that the exporter's sales 
contract contain a shipping deadline within the applicable program year. 
The final date for a contractual shipping deadline will be stated in the 
Program Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified 
``undesignated'' or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that 
if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country 
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or 
``undesignated'' portion of the total country allocation may then be 
designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include 
an ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain 
further information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion 
of the country allocation.

    (9) Unit sales price of the commodity, or a mechanism to establish 
the price, as agreed between the exporter and the importer. If the 
commodity was sold on the basis of CFR or CIF, the actual (if known at 
the time of application) or estimated value of freight and, in the case 
of sales made on a CIF basis, the actual (if known at the time of 
application) or estimated value of marine and war risk insurance, must 
be specified;

in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 1493.440.
    (b) An application for a payment guarantee may be approved as 
submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the exporter, or 
rejected by the GSM. In the event that the application is approved, the 
GSM will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time 
specified in Sec. 1493.450(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit 
sales price of the commodity does not fall within the prevailing 
commercial market level ranges, as determined by CCC, the application 
will not be approved.
    (c) Ineligible exporter. An exporter will be ineligible to obtain a 
payment guarantee if such exporter:
    (1) Directly or indirectly owns or controls the importer;
    (2) Is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the importer; 
or
    (3) Is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a person(s) or

<R05>
Sec. 1493.440  Certification requirements for payment guarantee.

    By providing the statement in Sec. 1493.430(a)(17), the exporter is 
certifying that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section 
have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide 
further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do 
not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application 
for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in 
Sec. 1493.430(a)(17), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the 
payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.410(x).
    (b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law;
    (c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable 
oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been 
or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, 
pursuant to section 313 of

[[Page 843]]

the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed 
under Federal law on an imported commodity or product;
    (d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to 
solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement 
or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent 
fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.420, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications 
with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, 
notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul 
guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to 
proceed against the exporter.

[61 FR 33831, July 1, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 24561, May 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.450  Payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's obligation. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC 
agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to 
exceed the guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that 
the importer fails to pay under the importer obligation. unless CCC 
determines with respect to the particular transaction and claim that the 
guaranteed portion of the port value exceeded the prevailing U.S. market 
value for the same, or same type of agricultural commodity or product. 
In making this determination, CCC will adjust the prevailing U.S. market 
value for estimated freight and/or insurance costs if the export sale 
was made on a CFR or CIF basis. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.
    (b) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to a credit period not exceeding 180 days beginning either on the 
date(s) of export(s) or from the date when interest begins to accrue 
whichever is earlier, and will continue during the credit term specified 
in the payment guarantee or amendments thereto. However, the payment 
guarantee becomes effective on the date(s) of export(s) of the 
agricultural commodities or products thereof specified in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee.
    (c) Terms of the CCC payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's coverage 
will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the 
time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (d) Final date to export. The final date to export shown on the 
payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the 
contractual deadline for shipping.
    (e) Reserve coverage for loading tolerances. The exporter may apply 
for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee 
fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the 
export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC 
reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of 
the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If 
such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of 
application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so 
indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a 
quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid 
(i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage 
from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing 
for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional 
amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is 
not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the 
last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve 
the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.
    (f) Ineligible exports. Commodities with a date of export prior to 
the date

[[Page 844]]

of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written application 
for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after the final 
date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any amendments 
thereof, are ineligible for guarantee coverage under this subpart, 
except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of 
CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.
    (g) Foreign agricultural component. CCC may approve payment 
guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United 
States agricultural commodities as defined in Sec. 1493.410(x). CCC may 
not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for 
the value of any foreign agricultural component.
    (h) Additional requirements. The payment guarantee may contain such 
additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or 
desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (i) Amendments. A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee 
may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the 
assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the 
amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable 
Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may 
include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and 
an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, 
particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under 
the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. 
(Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be 
submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as 
amendments.)


<R05>
Sec. 1493.460  Guarantee rates and fees.

    (a) Guarantee fee rates. The current payment guarantee fee rate(s) 
will be available by Program Announcement.
    (b) Calculation of fee. The guarantee fee will be computed by 
multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.
    (c) Payment of fee. The exporter shall remit, with his written 
application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not 
be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The 
exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and 
mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts 
P/R.
    (d) Refunds of fee. Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved 
applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the 
application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be 
made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be 
in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee 
is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage 
requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.470  Evidence of export.

    (a) Report of export. The exporter is required to provide CCC an 
evidence of export report for each shipment made under the payment 
guarantee. This report must include the following:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Date of export;
    (3) Exporter's sale number;
    (4) Exported value;
    (5) Quantity;
    (6) A full description of the commodity exported;
    (7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the 
basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price at export 
differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, the exporter is also required to 
submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference;
    (8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any;
    (9) Number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under any other program 
if any portion of the export sale was also approved for participation in 
any of the following CCC or USDA export program: Export Enhancement 
Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance 
Program, or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program; and

[[Page 845]]

    (10) The exporter's statement, ``ALL SECTION 1493.480 CERTIFICATIONS 
ARE BEING MADE IN THIS EVIDENCE OF EXPORT'' which, when included in the 
evidence of export by the exporter, will constitute a certification that 
it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 1493.480.
    (b) Time limit for submission of evidence of export. The exporter 
must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/
R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 
calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period 
for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of 
the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of 
export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, 
the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the 
extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely 
to result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the 
program;
    (3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or
    (4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for 
submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such 
extension is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.
    (c) Export sales reporting. Exporters may have a mandatory reporting 
responsibility under section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, 
as amended (7 U.S.C. 5712) for exports of wheat and wheat flour, feed 
grains, oilseeds, cotton, and other agricultural commodities and 
products thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.480  Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

    By providing the statement contained in Sec. 1493.470(a)(10), the 
exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of 
export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements 
set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be 
required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to 
reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or 
violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, 
CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under 
this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet 
exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The exporter, in 
submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth 
in Sec. 1493.470(a)(10), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment 
guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.410(x).
    (b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity 
called for in the exporter's sales contract with the importer have been 
exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee;
    (c) There is an importer obligation as defined in Sec. 1493.410(n) 
to cover the exported value of the commodity exported;
    (d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.420 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 1493.490  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of commodities covered by a SCGP 
payment guarantee to a country other than that shown on the payment 
guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.
    (b) Records of proof of entry. Exporters must obtain and maintain 
records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant 
authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be 
necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the agricultural commodities 
exported in connection

[[Page 846]]

with the SCGP in the country that was the intended country of 
destination of such commodities. Records demonstrating proof of entry 
must be in English or be accompanied by a certified or other translation 
acceptable to CCC. Records acceptable to meet this requirement include 
an original certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs 
or port official of the importing country, by the importer, by an agent 
or representative of the vessel or shipline which delivered the 
agricultural commodity to the importing country, or by a private 
surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation deemed 
acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (1) That the agricultural commodity entered the importing country;
    (2) The identification of the export carrier;
    (3) The quantity of the agricultural commodity;
    (4) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the agricultural 
commodity; and
    (5) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the agricultural 
commodity in the importing country. (Records of proof of entry need not 
be submitted with a claim for loss, except as may be provided in 
Sec. 1493.500(b)(4)(ii).)


<R05>
Sec. 1493.500  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the importer fails to make payment 
pursuant to the terms of the importer obligation, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as 
possible, but not later than 10 calendar days after the date that 
payment was due from the importer (the due date). A notice of default 
must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address 
specified in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with 
this paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with 
respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit 
may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if such 
extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best 
interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the country;
    (3) Name of the defaulting importer;
    (4) Due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately 
the amounts for principal and interest;
    (6) Date of importer's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for importer's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must 
be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified 
in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following 
information and documents:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the importer 
obligation applicable to the claim;
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i) The importer obligation;
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the importing country;
    (iii)(A) The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, 
FOB, CFR or CIF values; or
    (B) If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's 
invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's 
invoice to the importer;
    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of

[[Page 847]]

payment in default under the applicable export sale. The instrument must 
reference the applicable importer obligation; and
    (v) A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the 
exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.470(a).
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. If the initial 
claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee 
need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial 
claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating 
to failure of the importer to make scheduled installments on the same 
export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only 
submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated 
in paragraph (b) (1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of 
subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including 
the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.510  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.500, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable 
supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC 
determines that it is liable to the exporter and/or the exporter's 
assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. Subject to a determination by CCC 
with respect to prevailing U.S. market value pursuant to 
Sec. 1493.450(a) of this part, CCC's maximum liability for any claims 
for loss submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not including 
any late interest payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus 
eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export, 
plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the day of receipt of a claim found 
by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date 
that payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the 
guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section, and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the 
Department of Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract or the 
importer obligation unless it is determined to be in the best interests 
of CCC by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its 
option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued 
interest, in default and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from 
CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a 
payment guarantee, CCC will not, except pursuant to a determination 
under Sec. 1493.450(a) of this part, hold the assignee responsible or 
take any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any 
action, omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has 
no knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Secs. 1493.470 and 1493.480, excluding post-export adjustments (i.e., 
corrections to evidence of export reports); and
    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.500.

[[Page 848]]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.520  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the importer of CCC's rights under 
the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer or any other source whatsoever, such monies shall be 
immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies are not received 
by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will 
owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt by 
CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest average 
investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as 
announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of 
recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be 
charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment 
guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the 
holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided 
that the required information necessary for determining pro rata 
distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 
business days from the date of recovery or 15 business days from 
receiving the required information for determining pro rata 
distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and such interest will accrue from such date to the 
date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of 
the recovery payable to the holder of the payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the 
exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated 
by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to CCC on a pro 
rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. 
The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata 
basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in 
default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment 
guarantee, CCC pro rates any collections it receives and shares these 
collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both 
CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. 
Appendix A to Sec. 1493.520--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
Recoveries--provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in 
applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts 
paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by 
CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in 
material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee 
or for fulfilling obligations under SCGP. Further, the exporter's 
assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the 
payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the 
exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program 
requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Secs. 1493.440(b) and 1493.480(d) or the failure of an exporter to 
comply with the provisions of Secs. 1493.490 or 1493.530(e) will not 
affect the validity of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee 
which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the 
time such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of 
assignment of the payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the importer.

[[Page 849]]

  Appendix A to Sec. 1493.520--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.520(c), regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for 
claims filed under the SCGP. A typical case might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. exporter enters into a $200,000, 180 day credit 
arrangement with the importer calling for two equal payments of 
principal and two equal payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per 
annum and a penalty interest rate of 12 percent per annum (basis 360 
days) on overdue amounts until the overdue amount is paid. (Basis for 
interest calculation may be 360 or 365 days.)
    2. The importer fails to make the final principal payment of 
$100,000 and an interest payment of $2,500.00 (10% per annum for 90 days 
on $100,000), both due on January 31.
    3. On February 10, the U.S. exporter files a claim in good order 
with CCC.
    4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
60 percent of the principal amount due ($60,000) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 60 percent of the principal 
outstanding ($1,183.56) (8% per annum for 90 days on $60,000). (CCC's 
basis for interest calculation is 365 days.)
    5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    6. The average investment rate of the most recent 91-day Treasury 
Bill auction average which has been published by the Department of 
Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment by CCC (January 31) is 7 
percent. (CCC's late interest rate.)

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the payment 
guarantee would be computed as follows:

1. CCC's Obligation under the Payment Guarantee:
    (a) Principal coverage--(60% $100,000)...........         $60,000.00
    (b) Interest coverage--(8% per annum for 90 days            1,183.56
     on $60,000, basis 365 days).....................
                                                      ------------------
          ...........................................         $61,183.56
    (c) Late interest due from CCC (7% per annum for              129.07
     11 days on $61,183.56, basis 365 days)..........
                                                      ------------------
    (d) Amount paid by CCC on February 22............         $61,312.63
                                                      ==================
2. Importer's obligation under the importer
 obligation:
    (a) Principal due January 31.....................        $100,000.00
        Interest due January 31 (10% per annum for 90           2,500.00
         days on $100,000, basis 360 days)...........
                                                      ------------------
        Amount owed by importer as of January 31.....        $102,500.00
    (b) Penalty interest due (12% per annum for 22                751.67
     days on $102,500.00, basis 360 days)............
                                                      ------------------
    (c) Amount owed by importer as of February 22....        $103,251.67
3. Amount of importer's obligation not covered by
 CCC's payment guarantee: $41,939.04 ($103,251.67-
 $61,312.63).........................................
 

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the importer obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the importer is 
$103,251.67, CCC would be entitled to 59.38 percent ($61,312.63 divided 
by $103,251.67) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be 
entitled to 40.62 percent ($41,939.04 divided by $103,251.67) of any 
recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this 
example, the losses were recovered after the claim has been paid by CCC, 
Sec. 1493.520(b) would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.530  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to 
such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment 
must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already 
paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless 
approved in advance by CCC, be:
    (i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties; or
    (ii) Subject to further assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.

[[Page 850]]

    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be 
ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, CCC will provide notice thereof, to the financial 
institution and to the exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of 
an acknowledgment of assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
entity issuing the importer obligation.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial institution:
    (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in 
sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
entity issuing the importer obligation.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees. CCC may, with 
the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under 
the payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the 
exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for 
the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other 
than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those 
alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in 
rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the 
payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the 
amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment 
guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, must 
maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and 
deliveries of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with a payment guarantee, including those records 
generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and related 
companies involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The 
Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United 
States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and 
complete access to the premises of the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the 
effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such 
five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the 
exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's, or 
related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions 
relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, 
financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, 
processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and 
unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized 
representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside 
the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain 
directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in 
connection with the payment guarantee.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by 
Sec. 1493.490(b), and must provide access to such documentation if 
requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized 
representative for the five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.

[[Page 851]]

    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and Notices to 
Participants issued pursuant to this subpart. Applicants for payment 
guarantees are hereby on notice that they will be bound by any terms 
contained in applicable Program Announcements or Notices to Participants 
issued prior to the date of approval of a payment guarantee.

    (h) Officials not to benefit. No member of or delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the 
payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this 
provision shall not be construed to extend to the payment guarantee if 
made with a corporation for its general benefit.

Sec. 1494.10  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Commodity

[[Page 852]]

Credit Corporation's (CCC) Export Enhancement Program (EEP). These 
criteria are interrelated and will be considered together in order to 
select eligible commodities and eligible countries for EEP initiatives 
which will best meet the program's objectives. The objectives of the 
program are to discourage unfair trade practices by other countries, to 
increase U.S. agricultural commodity exports, and to encourage other 
countries exporting agricultural commodities to undertake serious 
negotiations on agricultural trade problems. Under the EEP, bonuses are 
made available by CCC to enable exporters to meet prevailing world 
prices for targeted commodities in targeted destinations. In the 
operation of the EEP, CCC will make reasonable efforts to avoid the 
displacement of usual marketings of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.20  Criteria.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for 
initiatives will include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) The expected contribution of proposed initiatives in furthering 
trade policy negotiations and, in particular, in furthering the U.S. 
trade policy negotiating strategy of countering competitors' subsidies 
and other unfair trade practices by displacing such countries' 
subsidized exports in targeted countries;
    (b) The contribution which initiatives will make toward realizing 
U.S. agricultural export goals and, in particular, in developing, 
expanding, or maintaining markets for U.S. agricultural commodities;
    (c) The effect that sales facilitated by initiatives would have on 
non-subsidizing exporters of agricultural products; and
    (d) The subsidy requirements of proposed initiatives compared to the 
expected benefits.

<R05>
Sec. 1494.101  General statement.

    This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the 
Export Enhancement Program (EEP) of the Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC). CCC will, from time to time, announce, through public press 
release, initiatives to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural 
commodities to targeted markets. The public press release, which will 
contain the name of a person for interested parties to contact, will be 
followed by the issuance of an Invitation for Offers (Invitation). 
Invitations will be issued pursuant to this subpart by the General Sales 
Manager (GSM) and will specify the eligible country(ies) (the targeted 
market), the unit of measure, the eligible commodity, the maximum 
quantity of the eligible commodity eligible for a CCC bonus, the quality 
specifications of the eligible commodity (including possible 
restrictions on type, kind, grade and/or class or other quality 
specifications), the eligible buyer(s), the method and rate for 
determining liquidated damages and performance security requirements, 
and any other terms and conditions peculiar to that Invitation. 
Invitations may be one of the following two types: Those inviting 
exporters which have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to submit a 
competitive offer for a CCC Bonus; and those inviting exporters which 
have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to apply for an Announced 
CCC Bonus. After an interested person has qualified to submit an offer 
for an eligible commodity, the eligible exporter may submit an offer to 
CCC in response to an Invitation. Such offer must contain the 
information required by this subpart and any additional information 
required by the applicable Invitation. The exporter's offer will include 
either the Announced CCC Bonus, if applicable, or an amount in dollars 
and cents for a bonus deemed necessary by the exporter to make a 
commercial sale of the eligible commodity for export to the eligible 
country competitive with export sales of the commodity by other 
exporting countries to buyers in the eligible country. If the exporter 
has furnished the required performance security and the offer is 
acceptable to CCC, then CCC will notify the exporter that its

[[Page 853]]

offer has been accepted. CCC and the exporter will enter into an 
Agreement in which CCC will agree to pay the bonus to the exporter in 
return for the exporter's submission of proof that the eligible 
commodity has been exported from the United States and entered into the 
eligible country, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 1494.301  Information required for program participation.

    Before CCC will consider an offer from an interested person, such 
person must qualify for participation in the program. Based upon 
information submitted by the interested person and available from public 
sources, CCC will determine whether the interested person is eligible 
for participation in the program.
    (a) Submission of documentation. An interested person that wishes to 
qualify as an eligible exporter must furnish the following information 
or documentation to CCC at the address referenced in the Notice to 
Exporters--EEP Contacts:
    (1) The address of the interested person's office and the name and 
address of an agent in the U.S. for the service of process;
    (2) The legal form of doing business of the interested person, e.g., 
sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, etc.;
    (3) The place of incorporation of the interested person, if the 
interested person is a corporation;
    (4) The name and address of an office(s) of the interested person 
within the U.S., if the interested person is a foreign corporation or 
other foreign entity; and
    (5) A certified statement describing the interested person's 
participation, if any, during the past three years in U.S. Government 
programs, contracts or agreements.
    (6) The following certification: ``I certify, to the best of my 
knowledge and belief, that neither [name of interested person] nor any 
of its principals has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for 
debarment from contracting with or participating in programs 
administered by any U.S. Government agency. [``Principals,'' for the 
purpose of this certification, means officers; directors; owners of five 
percent or more of stock; partners; and persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibility within a business entity (e.g., 
general manager, plant manager, head of a subsidiary division or 
business segment, and similar positions).] I further agree that, should 
any such debarment, suspension, or notice of proposed debarment occur in 
the future,

[[Page 856]]

[name of interested person] will immediately notify CCC.''
    (b) Necessity to qualify. An interested person may not submit an 
offer, and CCC will not consider any such offer, until CCC has notified 
the interested person that such person has qualified as an eligible 
exporter.
    (c) Additional submissions. CCC will promptly notify interested 
persons that have submitted information required by this section whether 
they have qualified to have their offers considered. Any person failing 
to qualify will be notified of the basis of CCC's decision and will be 
given an opportunity to provide additional information for consideration 
by CCC.
    (d) Previous performance. CCC may request additional information 
with respect to the interested person's performance under any U.S. 
Government programs or in connection with any contracts or agreements 
with the U.S. Government during the past three years.
    (e) Ineligibility for program participation. A person may be 
ineligible to participate in the EEP if such person:
    (1) Is currently debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment from 
contracting with or participating in any program administered by a U.S. 
Government agency; or
    (2) Is controlled or can be controlled, in whole or in part, by any 
individuals or entities currently debarred, suspended or proposed for 
debarment from contracting with or participating in programs 
administered by a U.S. Government agency.
    (f) Duty to update information provided to CCC. An eligible exporter 
is under a continuing obligation to inform CCC of any changes in the 
information or documentation submitted to CCC pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section and to provide current and accurate information to CCC.
    (g) Payment of bonus to exporters without proven EEP participation. 
An eligible exporter that has not yet demonstrated its ability to 
participate successfully in the EEP will be eligible to receive a bonus 
payment(s) only after the eligible commodity specified in an EEP 
Agreement has entered into the eligible country. Such an exporter must 
furnish performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable 
Invitation and follow the procedure specified in Sec. 1494.701(d) to 
request the payment of the bonus. An eligible exporter may demonstrate 
its ability to participate successfully in the EEP by entering or 
causing to be entered into the eligible country at least 95% of the 
quantity of the eligible commodity specified in any one EEP Agreement. 
CCC will consider that an exporter has proven its ability to participate 
successfully in the EEP as of the date on which CCC pays to the exporter 
a bonus for entry of a quantity that brings the total entered quantity 
for any one EEP Agreement to at least 95%. For all EEP Agreements that 
such exporter enters into with CCC subsequent to that date, the exporter 
may furnish performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable 
Invitation and will be eligible to receive bonus payments in accordance 
with Sec. 1494.701(c).

[56 FR 25011, June 3, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 21039, May 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1494.401  Performance security.

    (a) Requirement to establish performance security. Prior to the 
submission of an offer to CCC in response to an Invitation, an eligible 
exporter must establish performance security, in a form which is 
acceptable to CCC, in order to guarantee the eligible exporter's 
faithful performance of the Agreement. If CCC enters into an Agreement 
with the eligible exporter, this performance security must remain in 
effect until its cancellation or reduction is authorized by CCC pursuant 
to paragraph (f) of this section. An offer made by an eligible exporter 
will not be considered if proof of the establishment of the performance 
security is not made available to CCC by 3 p.m. on the date for which 
the offer is submitted for consideration.
    (b) Form of performance security. The performance security must be 
acceptable to CCC and may be an irrevocable standby letter of credit, a 
bond, or a certified or cashier's check. If a standby letter of credit 
is furnished as performance security, the opening bank may be a U.S. 
bank or a foreign bank. If the standby letter of credit is opened by a 
foreign bank, it must be 100 percent confirmed by a U.S. bank. If a

[[Page 857]]

bond is furnished as performance security, the surety(ies) must be among 
those appearing on the list of approved sureties maintained by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury. If a cashier's or certified check is 
furnished as performance security, the bank issuing the cashier's or 
certified check must be a U.S. bank.
    (c) Amount of performance security. The amount of the performance 
security to be furnished to CCC in response to a particular Invitation 
will depend upon whether the eligible exporter intends to select 
``Option A'' or ``Option B'' for the timing of the bonus payment. If the 
eligible exporter furnishes performance security under ``Option A'' of 
the applicable Invitation, the eligible exporter may request payment of 
the bonus after export of the eligible commodity but before entry of the 
commodity into the eligible country. If the eligible exporter furnishes 
performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable Invitation, 
the eligible exporter may request payment of the bonus only after the 
exported eligible commodity has entered into the eligible country. The 
applicable Invitation will specify the exact amount of performance 
security for the eligible commodity required under either ``Option A'' 
or ``Option B'' and the method and rate for determining liquidated 
damages. After the exporter and CCC enter into an Agreement, the 
exporter may request CCC to change the performance security option for 
an entire Agreement from ``Option B'' to ``Option A'' and, if CCC agrees 
to this change, the exporter will increase the performance security 
amount to the level required by the applicable Invitation for ``Option 
A''.
    (d) Additional security. The exporter shall promptly furnish such 
additional security as CCC may determine is necessary to protect CCC 
under an Agreement if the surety(ies) or obligating bank:
    (1) Becomes unacceptable to the U.S. Government or CCC; and/or
    (2) Fails to furnish reports on its financial condition as required 
by the U.S. Government or CCC.
    (e) Right to funds under the performance security. If CCC enters 
into an Agreement with an exporter under the EEP, CCC will have the 
right to funds from the performance security established by the exporter 
for such Agreement to recover:
    (1) The amount of any bonus paid to the exporter under the Agreement 
if the exporter fails to perform in accordance with such Agreement;
    (2) Any funds owed by the exporter to CCC related to the specific 
EEP Agreement for which the performance security was established, 
including those for liquidated damages, discounts for late performance, 
overpayments made by CCC, storage charges, or other damages or charges 
as determined by CCC; and/or
    (3) Any amounts or funds that could be owed by the exporter to CCC 
in accordance with subparagraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section for 
unfulfilled obligations under the Agreement if the performance security 
should expire prior to the exporter's fulfillment of these obligations. 
Should the exporter fulfill these obligations, in accordance with the 
Agreement, after CCC has drawn upon the performance security, CCC will 
return the funds drawn to the exporter or other appropriate party, as 
determined by CCC. CCC may return the performance security if it 
determines that the exporter is not liable for any damages incurred by 
CCC as a result of the exporter's failure to fulfill its obligations 
under the Agreement and that the exporter will not retain any bonus 
payment which was not earned.
    (f) Cancellation or reduction of performance security. (1) CCC will 
agree, upon request by the exporter, to a cancellation of the 
performance security established for an Agreement when CCC determines, 
on the basis of evidence provided by the exporter or other evidence 
available to CCC, that:
    (i) The exporter has fully performed under the Agreement;
    (ii) The exporter has fully compensated CCC for all costs incurred 
or damages suffered by CCC, unless CCC has determined to hold the 
exporter harmless for such damages pursuant to Sec. 1494.801(d) as a 
result of the exporter's nonperformance of the Agreement; or
    (iii) It is no longer in the best interest of the EEP to require the 
exporter to maintain the performance security,

[[Page 858]]

and the exporter submits to CCC a written statement agreeing that all 
other terms and conditions of the Agreement will remain unchanged 
pending final resolution of the exporter's liabilities to CCC.
    (2) To support a request for the cancellation of performance 
security furnished in connection with an Agreement, the exporter must 
provide to CCC evidence of the export of the eligible commodity as 
provided by Sec. 1494.701(c), and the entry of the eligible commodity 
into the eligible country or countries. The entry certification must be 
in English or accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable 
to CCC. To show entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible 
country, the exporter must furnish to CCC an original certification 
signed by a duly authorized customs or port official of the eligible 
country, by the eligible buyer, by an agent or representative of the 
vessel or shipline which delivered the eligible commodity to the 
eligible country, or by a private surveyor in the target country or 
other documentation deemed acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (i) That the eligible commodity entered the eligible country;
    (ii) The identification of the export carrier;
    (iii) The quantity of the eligible commodity unloaded;
    (iv) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the eligible commodity; 
and
    (v) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the eligible commodity 
in the eligible country.
    (3) If the exporter makes multiple shipments against a sales 
contract with an eligible buyer, CCC may agree to a proportional 
reduction in the amount of the required performance security when the 
exporter has furnished evidence that the exporter has performed under 
the Agreement with respect to a particular shipment.
    (4) Upon the payment of liquidated damages by an exporter to CCC 
under a specific Agreement or the determination by CCC, pursuant to 
Sec. 1494.801(d), to hold the exporter harmless for the payment of 
liquidated damages owed to CCC under a specific Agreement, CCC will 
allow the exporter to cancel or reassign that portion of the performance 
security opened for such specific Agreement that would relate to the 
value of the liquidated damages.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.501  Submission of offers to CCC.

    (a) Consideration of offers. Unless otherwise specified in the 
Invitation, CCC will consider offers on a daily basis from the date of 
issuance of the Invitation until such time that CCC announces that 
offers will no longer be accepted under the Invitation, the total 
quantity of the eligible commodity announced in the Invitation has been 
awarded, or the Invitation has expired as indicated by the expiration 
date shown in the Invitation.
    (1) Prior to the submission of an offer to CCC, the eligible 
exporter must have entered into a sales contract, as defined in

an eligible buyer must be after the issuance date of the applicable

Agreement with CCC under the EEP for the payment of a bonus.
    (4) CCC will not be responsible to any person for any loss caused by 
the failure of the eligible exporter to obtain a CCC bonus.
    (5) The eligible exporter must promptly notify CCC in writing of any 
amendment to the sales contract with an eligible buyer.

considered. The date and time affixed to submissions will be as 
determined by CCC.
    (c) Content of offers. Offers to CCC for a CCC bonus under the EEP 
must contain the information shown below in

[[Page 859]]

the same numerical order as shown below. CCC reserves the right to

announced the bonus amount, the eligible exporter shall state the dollar 
and cents amount of the Announced CCC Bonus.
    (7) The quantity, on a net weight basis, (less any dockage, if

independently from the EEP offer and CCC bears no responsibility if such 
credit payment terms cannot be secured.

    (d) Conditional offers. Any qualification or condition in, or added 
to, the offer and not expressly authorized by this subpart or the

<R05>
Sec. 1494.601  Acceptance of offers by CCC.

    (a) Establishment of acceptable sales prices and CCC bonuses. For 
each Invitation, CCC will establish sales prices for the eligible 
commodity and CCC bonus amounts which would be acceptable to CCC in 
terms of furthering the objectives of the EEP.
    (1) In establishing acceptable sales prices for the eligible 
commodity, CCC will consider available relevant market data.
    (2) In determining acceptable CCC bonus amounts, CCC may take into 
consideration factors such as, but not limited to, the following: The 
prevailing domestic market price of the eligible commodity; the price of 
the same agricultural commodity exported by other exporting countries to 
the eligible country; ocean freight rates for the export of the eligible 
commodity from the U.S. and other exporting countries to the eligible 
country; the particular preferences or purchasing practices of buyers in 
the eligible country which would customarily affect the acceptability of 
the eligible commodity relative to that of competing exports of the same 
agricultural commodity to the eligible country from other exporting 
countries; and the cost effectiveness of the payment of a CCC bonus 
amount in view of CCC's obligation to maximize the use of resources 
available for the operation of the EEP.
    (3) The acceptable sales prices and bonus amounts will be modified 
by CCC as necessary to take advantage of updated information that 
becomes available to CCC.
    (b) Acceptance of offers for a CCC bonus on a competitive basis. An 
offer from an eligible exporter for a CCC bonus on a competitive bonus 
that meets all of the requirements of this subpart will first be 
reviewed to determine if the offer contains an acceptable sales price. 
If the sales price contained in the offer is found to be acceptable, 
then the CCC bonus contained in the offer will be reviewed to determine 
if the CCC bonus requested is found to be acceptable. Offers with 
acceptable sales prices and acceptable CCC bonuses will be accepted 
under each Invitation beginning with the offer having the lowest CCC 
bonus

[[Page 862]]

amount, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this 
section.
    (c) Acceptance of offers for an announced CCC bonus. Offers from 
eligible exporters for an Announced CCC Bonus that meet all of the 
requirements of this subpart and which contain an acceptable sales price 
will be accepted under each Invitation on a first-come, first-served 
basis according to the time of receipt of the offer, as determined by 
CCC, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this 
section.
    (d) Notification of acceptance of offers. CCC will notify an 
eligible exporter by telephone of the acceptance or rejection of its 
offer as soon as possible after review of the exporter's offer by CCC 
but not later than 10 a.m. of the next business day after the date the 
offer was submitted for consideration. If an offer is rejected, CCC will 
notify the eligible exporter of the basis for the rejection. Acceptance 
of offers will be confirmed in writing. The date of the telephonic 
notification of acceptance by CCC of the eligible exporter's offer will 
be the effective date of the exporter's Agreement with CCC.
    (e) Announcement of acceptance of offers. CCC will generally 
announce the acceptance of offers by public press release as soon as 
possible after the notification to the exporter. The announcement will 
generally include the eligible commodity, the eligible country, the 
exporter, the delivery period, the CCC bonus, and, if applicable, the 
class of the eligible commodity.
    (f) Limitation on acceptance of offers. The total quantity of the 
eligible commodity, exclusive of tolerances, to be exported under all 
offers that are accepted by CCC pursuant to a particular Invitation will 
not be greater than the total quantity of the eligible commodity stated 
in such Invitation. CCC may refuse to accept further offers under an 
applicable Invitation if the quantity of the eligible commodity, 
exclusive of tolerances, already accepted totals the quantity, exclusive 
of tolerances, that is being tendered for by the eligible buyer, even 
though such quantity may be less than the total quantity available under 
that Invitation.
    (g) Rejection of offers. Any offer or part of an offer submitted for 
consideration that is not accepted by CCC by 10 a.m. of the next 
business day after the date for which the offer was submitted for 
consideration will be deemed to have been rejected.
    (h) CCC's right of rejection. Notwithstanding any other provisions 
of this subpart, CCC reserves the right to reject any or all offers 
submitted for consideration on a particular day, including those offers 
that have acceptable sales prices and CCC bonus amounts.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.701  Payment of bonus.

    (a) Forms of bonus. The bonus may be paid to the exporter in CCC 
Certificates or in any other form specified in the applicable Invitation 
which CCC determines to be appropriate.
    (b) Quantity on which bonus is paid. The quantity of the eligible 
commodity exported from the U.S. which is eligible for the payment of a 
CCC bonus is the net weight (less any dockage, if applicable) or count 
which is established by the Official Inspection Certificate, the 
Official Weight Certificate or the export bill of lading, whichever is 
less. If the exporter has furnished performance security under ``Option 
A'' of the applicable Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid prior 
to the entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible country, this 
quantity will be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of 
making payment to the exporter. If the exporter is not paid the bonus 
until the commodity enters into the eligible country, then this quantity 
will also be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of 
making payment to the exporter, unless in the determination of CCC, 
there is evidence to suggest that there was destruction, diversion or 
loss of the eligible commodity prior to entry into the eligible country. 
The payment of a bonus value to an exporter does not indicate that the 
bonus has been earned by the exporter under the Agreement; pursuant to 
Sec. 1494.801(a)(3), the bonus is not earned by the exporter until the 
eligible commodity enters into the eligible country in accordance with 
the Agreement and the exporter submits proof of such entry to CCC.
    (c) Request for bonus payment under ``Option A.'' If the exporter 
has furnished performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable 
Invitation

[[Page 863]]

and wishes the bonus to be paid after export of the eligible commodity, 
the exporter must, within 30 calendar days after the date of export of 
the eligible commodity, furnish to the Director, at the address 
referenced in the Notice to Exporters--Contacts for EEP, a written 
request for payment of the bonus. All documents submitted to support 
such a request must be acceptable to the Director.
    (1) To support each bonus payment request, the exporter must furnish 
to the Director the following:
    (i) The original or an original copy of the on-board bill of lading 
issued for the export carrier and signed by an agent of the export 
carrier. The bill of lading must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity;
    (D) An on-board date; and
    (E) That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible 
country.
    (ii) The original or an original copy of the Official Weight 
Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate 
must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time 
of issuance;
    (B) The date and place of issuance; and
    (C) The weight or count of the eligible commodity.
    (iii) The original or an original copy of the Official Inspection 
Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate 
must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time 
of issuance;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity to which the certificate 
relates; and
    (D) The quality description of the eligible commodity.
    (iv) If the documents submitted under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section do not specify the export carrier, the exporter 
must also submit a signed certification that the commodity represented 
by the Official Inspection and/or the Official Weight certificates is 
the identical eligible commodity represented on the export bill of 
lading.
    (2) If the export of the eligible commodity was by lash barge, the 
exporter must furnish, in addition to the documents required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a statement from the vessel's agent 
showing that the lash barge was loaded to the lash vessel named in the 
on-board lash bill of lading and that the eligible commodity is destined 
for the eligible country.
    (3) If the export of the eligible commodity was from a Canadian 
transshipment port on the St. Lawrence River, the exporter must furnish 
to the Director the following, in addition to the documents required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
    (i) Documentary evidence covering the movement of the eligible 
commodity from the United States to the export carrier described in the 
on-board bill of lading issued at the Canadian transshipment port and 
showing the information provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and, if 
applicable, (c)(2) of this section; and
    (ii) A certification that the eligible commodity exported is the 
identical eligible commodity that was shipped from the United States.
    (4) If the export of the eligible commodity was by railcar or truck, 
the exporter must furnish to the Director the following, in addition to 
the documents required by paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section:
    (i) The authenticated landing certificate or similar document issued 
by the government of the eligible country; and
    (ii) The original or an original copy of the bill of lading issued 
at the point of loading the railcar or truck. The bill of lading must 
show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity;
    (D) The date that the railcar or truck was loaded; and
    (E) That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible 
country.
    (d) Request for bonus payment under ``Option B.'' If the exporter 
has furnished performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable 
Invitation

[[Page 864]]

and wishes the bonus to be paid after the entry of the exported eligible 
commodity into the eligible country, the exporter must, within 60 
calendar days after the date of entry of the eligible commodity into the 
eligible country, furnish to the Director at the address referenced in 
the Notice to Exporters--Contracts for EEP, a written request for 
payment of the bonus. To support each request, the exporter must furnish 
to the Director, in a form acceptable to the Director, the documents 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable, along with 
the certification of entry specified in Sec. 1494.401(f)(2).
    (e) Time frame for payment of a bonus. CCC will endeavor to pay the 
bonus to the exporter within 10 business days after CCC determines that 
the documents supporting the bonus request are acceptable.
    (f) Certificate amount. If CCC decides to pay the bonus in the form 
of a CCC Certificate(s), the dollar value of the certificate(s) issued 
to the exporter will be determined by multiplying the CCC bonus 
specified in the Agreement by the net quantity of the eligible commodity 
on which the bonus is to be paid, as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, less any dockage if applicable.
    (g) Late requests for bonus payment. If CCC decides to pay the bonus 
in the form of a CCC Certificate(s) and the exporter fails to request 
issuance of the certificate(s) within 30 calendar days after the date of 
export of the eligible commodity, if the exporter has chosen performance 
security ``Option A,'' or within 60 days after the entry of the eligible 
commodity into the eligible country, if the exporter has chosen 
performance security ``Option B'', CCC may, upon issuing the 
certificate(s), discount the certificate(s) in an amount determined 
appropriate by CCC to compensate it for costs which may be incurred by 
CCC as a result of the exporter's delay.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.801  Enforcement and termination of agreements with CCC.

    (a) Performance in accordance with an Agreement with CCC. (1) An 
exporter which enters into an Agreement with CCC must ensure that the 
eligible commodity is exported from the U.S. and enters the eligible 
country in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
    (2) The diversion of the eligible commodity to a country other than 
the eligible country is prohibited. Transshipments of the eligible 
commodity are permitted only if specifically allowed in the applicable 
Invitation or for shipment through a Canadian transshipment port on the 
St. Lawrence River if the eligible commodity had been shipped from the 
United States via the Great Lakes coastal range and its identity had 
been preserved until shipped from Canada.
    (3) Regardless of whether or not a bonus has been paid by CCC to the 
exporter pursuant to Sec. 1494.701, the bonus is not earned by the 
exporter until the eligible commodity enters into the eligible country 
in accordance with the Agreement. In order to retain a bonus or request 
payment of a bonus, depending upon the option chosen for furnishing 
performance security, and to request cancellation of the performance 
security, the exporter must provide evidence to CCC, as specified in 
Sec. 1494.401(f)(2), that the eligible commodity entered into the 
eligible country. If, on the basis of evidence available to it, CCC 
determines that there was destruction, diversion or loss of the eligible 
commodity prior to entry into the eligible country, CCC will not release 
the amount of performance security corresponding to the amount of 
eligible commodity for which insufficient evidence of entry into the 
eligible country was presented to CCC until:
    (i) CCC recovers from the exporter the amount of the bonus 
corresponding to such amount of the eligible commodity, if the exporter 
has already been paid the bonus under performance security ``Option A''; 
and
    (ii) The requirements of either Sec. 1494.401(f)(1)(ii) or 
Sec. 1494.401(f)(1)(iii) have been met.
    (4) The failure of an exporter to perform in full and to fulfill all 
of its obligations under the Agreement will constitute a breach of the 
Agreement. An exporter which breaches the Agreement may be required to 
forfeit its right to receive or retain part or all of the bonus 
authorized or paid under the Agreement and may also be liable to

[[Page 865]]

CCC for damages. Examples of an exporter's failure to perform under the 
Agreement include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) The exporter does not ship all of the required amount of the 
eligible commodity in accordance with the delivery period stated in the 
Agreement;
    (ii) The exporter exports an amount of the eligible commodity that 
is inconsistent with the quality specifications in the Agreement;
    (iii) The exporter is unable to provide a certification that all of 
the eligible commodity exported pursuant to the Agreement was entered 
into the eligible country;
    (iv) The eligible commodity is transshipped through any country, 
other than Canada, unless specifically allowed in the applicable 
Invitation; or
    (v) The eligible commodity is transshipped through Canada without 
having its identity preserved.
    (5) If the eligible commodity is to be delivered to the eligible 
buyer in multiple shipments, CCC may decide to consider the shipments 
separately in determining whether the exporter has failed to perform 
under the Agreement.
    (b) Return of bonus. An exporter that fails to fulfill all of its 
obligations under the Agreement shall be in default. If an exporter that 
has already been paid the bonus value defaults, CCC shall have the right 
to recover the bonus value paid for the quantity of the eligible 
commodity with respect to which the exporter failed to perform under the 
Agreement.
    (1) If CCC has paid this bonus value in the form of a CCC 
Certificate(s), the exporter shall pay to CCC the higher of:
    (i) The dollar value of the CCC Certificate(s);
    (ii) The dollar amount received for the CCC Certificate(s) if the 
CCC Certificate(s) was transferred to another party; or
    (iii) The dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of the CCC-
owned commodities exchanged for the CCC Certificate(s) if the 
commodities were sold to another party.
    (2) If CCC has paid this bonus value in some other form, as 
specified in the applicable Invitation, the exporter shall pay to CCC 
the dollar and cents amount or equivalent of the bonus value paid to the 
exporter.
    (c) Liability for liquidated damages. The exporter's failure to 
perform under the Agreement will cause serious and substantial losses to 
CCC, such as damages to the EEP and CCC's domestic price support 
program, storage charges, and administrative and other costs incurred. 
If the exporter breaches the Agreement, the exporter will be liable to 
pay to CCC as liquidated damages an amount obtained by applying the 
method or rate for determining damages specified in the applicable 
Invitation to the quantity of the eligible commodity with respect to 
which the exporter failed to perform under such Agreement. In submitting 
an offer in response to an Invitation issued under this subpart, the 
exporter agrees that such liquidated damages are reasonable estimates of 
the probable actual damages which may be incurred by CCC.
    (d) Decision to hold the exporter harmless for liquidated damages. 
CCC will hold an exporter harmless for the payment of liquidated damages 
if:
    (1) The exporter's failure to perform under the Agreement was due to 
causes solely without the exporter's fault or negligence and the 
exporter had taken the necessary action to enable it to export the 
required quantity of the eligible commodity and enter it into the 
eligible country; or
    (2) The eligible commodity was lost or destroyed after it had been 
placed aboard the export carrier.

In making the decision whether to hold an exporter harmless pursuant to 
this paragraph, CCC may consider any information available to CCC, 
including any information provided to it by the exporter.
    (e) Fraud, scheme or device. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, CCC may take action to recover any bonus paid or to hold the 
exporter liable for the payment of damages caused to CCC if the exporter 
engages in fraud with respect to the EEP, or adopts or participates in 
adopting a scheme or device which is designed to evade this subpart or 
which has the effect of evading this subpart. Such acts shall include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Concealing information which is required by this subpart; or

[[Page 866]]

    (2) Submitting information which is known by the exporter to be 
false or erroneous.
    (f) CCC's right to recover amounts due CCC by exporters. If the 
exporter breaches its obligations under the Agreement and becomes liable 
to CCC for repayment of the bonus value or for liquidated or other 
damages, CCC reserves the right to recover such amounts due CCC by 
making a claim against the performance security furnished to CCC, as 
described under Sec. 1494.401, or by taking any other measures available 
to CCC as a result of this subpart or any laws or regulations, including 
debt settlement regulations, applicable to CCC.
    (g) Shipping tolerances. If the exporter exports and enters into the 
eligible country, in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement, 
a quantity of the eligible commodity which is less than the quantity 
specified in Sec. 1494.501(c)(7) but not less than such quantity minus 5 
percent, the exporter shall not be required to pay liquidated damages 
for failure to perform under the Agreement for the quantity which failed 
to be exported and entered into the eligible country. If an exporter 
exports and enters into the eligible country, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Agreement, a quantity of the eligible commodity 
which is greater than the quantity specified in Sec. 1494.501(c)(7), the 
exporter may request payment of the bonus value based upon the actual 
quantity, on a net weight basis, exported and entered into the eligible 
country, but not greater than the quantity specified in 
Sec. 1494.501(c)(7), plus 5 percent.
    (h) Termination of agreements. (1) CCC may, by written notice to the 
exporter, terminate an Agreement, in whole or in part, as a result of:
    (i) the failure of the exporter to carry out any provisions of the 
Agreement;
    (ii) the failure of the exporter to maintain a business office in 
the U.S.;
    (iii) the failure of the exporter to maintain an agent in the U.S. 
for service of process; or
    (iv) the suspension or debarment of the exporter from participation 
in CCC or other U.S. Government programs.

If an Agreement is terminated by CCC pursuant to this subparagraph, CCC 
will not compensate the exporter for any costs incurred by the exporter. 
The exporter will be liable to CCC for any funds owed to CCC for the 
repayment of any bonus already paid and may be liable to CCC for 
liquidated or other damages suffered by CCC. If CCC intends to hold the 
exporter liable for liquidated damages, and it has not already so 
notified the exporter prior to the termination of the Agreement, CCC 
will generally do so at the time that it notifies the exporter of the 
termination of the Agreement.
    (2) CCC may, by written notice to the exporter, terminate an 
Agreement, in whole or in part, if CCC determines it to be in the best 
interest of CCC. If an agreement is so terminated, the exporter will be 
compensated for reasonable losses, as determined by CCC, resulting from 
such termination. These losses will not include lost profits and will 
not exceed the bonus value under the Agreement.
    (i) Amendment of agreements. (1) CCC will have the authority to 
amend an Agreement, either before or after such Agreement has been 
breached by the exporter, if the exporter requests that the Agreement be 
amended and CCC determines that such amendment would serve the best 
interests of the EEP. The exporter may be required to submit documentary 
evidence to CCC to demonstrate that it is making progress toward 
fulfilling the Agreement before CCC will consider amending the 
Agreement. All requests for amendments submitted by exporters, and all 
amendments made by CCC to an Agreement, under this subpart shall be in 
writing.
    (2) Prior to amending an Agreement with the exporter, CCC will 
consider whether the amendment to the Agreement should include a 
reduction in the CCC bonus or a modification of the sales price. If CCC 
determines that the CCC bonus and the sales price are still acceptable, 
it may amend the Agreement to incorporate the exporter's requested 
change, while maintaining the current CCC bonus and sales price, 
provided that the amendment would otherwise serve the best interests of 
the EEP. If CCC determines that the CCC bonus and/or the sales price are 
no longer acceptable, due to changes in market or other conditions, it 
will so

[[Page 867]]

inform the exporter. If the exporter still requests that the Agreement 
be amended, CCC and the exporter will enter into discussions in an 
attempt to arrive at a new CCC bonus and/or sales price which would be 
acceptable to CCC. If these discussions are successful, then CCC may 
amend the Agreement to incorporate the exporter's requested change as 
well as the new CCC bonus and/or sales price, provided that the 
amendment would otherwise serve the best interests of the EEP. If these 
discussions are unsuccessful, then the Agreement will not be amended and 
the exporter will be considered to be in breach of the Agreement if it 
fails to perform under the terms of the Agreement.
    (j) Amendments to sales contracts. In the event of an amendment to 
the sales contract between the exporter and the eligible buyer or a 
change in the delivery schedule, CCC will determine whether the 
amendment or change would constitute a breach of the Agreement. If CCC 
determines that the amendment or change would constitute a breach of the 
Agreement, CCC may terminate the Agreement. In the alternative, if CCC 
determines that a continuation of the Agreement would serve the best 
interests of the EEP, and if the exporter requests an amendment, CCC may 
amend the Agreement to take into account the amendment to the sales 
contract or change in delivery schedule. An amendment to an Agreement 
will be in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section. CCC will 
promptly advise the exporter of its determination in writing by letter, 
facsimile, or telex.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.901  Dispute resolution and appeals.

    (a) Dispute resolution. (1) The Director of the CCC Operations 
Division (Director, CCCOD) and the exporter will attempt to resolve any 
disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising 
under the EEP, this subpart, the applicable Invitation, or the 
Agreement.
    (2) The exporter may seek reconsideration of a determination by the 
Director, CCCOD relating to the Agreement by submitting a letter 
requesting reconsideration to the Director, CCCOD, within 30 days of the 
date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the date of 
a determination will be the date of the letter or other means of 
notification to the exporter of the determination. The exporter may 
include with the letter requesting reconsideration any additional 
information which it wishes the Director, CCCOD, to consider in 
reviewing its request. The Director, CCCOD, will respond to the request 
for reconsideration within 30 days of the date on which the request or 
the final documentary evidence submitted by the exporter is received by 
him, whichever is later, unless the GSM extends the time permitted for 
response. If the exporter fails to request reconsideration of a 
determination by the Director, CCCOD, that the exporter owes any funds 
to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds will become a debt of the 
exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-day period for submitting 
such a request.
    (3) If the exporter requested a reconsideration of a determination 
by the Director, CCCOD, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, 
and the Director, CCCOD, upheld the original determination, then the 
exporter may appeal the determination to the GSM in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the exporter 
fails to appeal the determination to the GSM, then any funds owed to CCC 
will become a debt of the exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-
day period for submitting an appeal to the GSM.
    (b) Appeal procedures. (1) An exporter which has exhausted the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the 
GSM a determination of the Director, CCCOD, relating to the Agreement 
between the exporter and CCC. An appeal to the GSM must be in writing 
and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 days following the 
date of the final determination by the Director, CCCOD. In this appeal 
to the GSM, the exporter shall be entitled to an administrative hearing 
before the GSM, if the exporter indicates in its appeal letter that it 
desires such a hearing.
    (2) If the exporter does not desire an administrative hearing, the 
exporter

[[Page 868]]

may submit any additional written information or documentation which it 
desires the GSM to consider in acting upon its appeal. This information 
or documentation may be submitted to the GSM up until the time that a 
decision is made by the GSM. The GSM will base the determination upon 
information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will 
endeavor to make a decision on an appeal not involving a hearing within 
60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the appeal or the date 
that final documentary evidence is submitted by the exporter to the GSM, 
whichever is later.
    (3) If the exporter has indicated that it desires an administrative 
hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing which is 
mutually convenient for the GSM and the exporter. This date will 
ordinarily be within 60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the 
request for hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure. The 
exporter and/or its counsel may present any administrative or 
documentary evidence to the GSM which it desires to have the GSM 
consider in making a determination. A transcript of the hearing will not 
ordinarily be prepared unless the exporter bears the costs involved in 
preparing the transcript, although the GSM may arrange to have a 
transcript prepared at the expense of the Government if it is determined 
to be appropriate. The exporter may provide additional written 
information to the GSM up until the time that the GSM makes a 
determination. The GSM will base the determination upon the information 
contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to make a 
decision within 60 days of the date of the hearing or the date of 
receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared, whichever is later.
    (4) The decision of the GSM will be the final determination of CCC 
and the exporter will be entitled to no further administrative appellate 
rights.
    (5) If the GSM upholds a determination of the Director, CCCOD, that 
the exporter owes any funds to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds 
will become a debt of the exporter to CCC.
    (c) Failure to comply with determination. If, for any reason, the 
exporter has failed to pay funds to CCC which have been determined to be 
owed to CCC under the Agreement and the exporter has exhausted its 
rights under this section or has failed to exercise such rights, then 
CCC will have the right to withdraw funds from the performance security 
established by the exporter or to take any other measures available to 
CCC as result of this subpart or any laws or regulations, including debt 
settlement regulations, applicable to CCC.
    (d) Exporter's obligation to perform. The exporter will continue to 
have an obligation to perform under the Agreement pending the conclusion 
of all procedures under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1001  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignments. The exporter may not assign the Agreement or any 
rights thereunder, including the right to receive a bonus under the 
Agreement.
    (b) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after CCC agrees to the cancellation of an exporter's 
performance security for an Agreement, the exporter must maintain 
accurate records showing sales and deliveries of the eligible commodity 
exported in connection with the Agreement. The Secretary of Agriculture 
and the Comptroller General of the United States, through their 
authorized representatives, will have full and complete access to the 
premises of the exporter during regular business hours from the 
effective date of the Agreement until the expiration of such five-year 
period to inspect, examine, audit and make copies of the exporter's 
books, records and accounts concerning transactions relating to the 
Agreement, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts 
pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and 
incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen. From the effective date of 
the Agreement and until the expiration of such five-year period, the 
exporter may be required to make available to the Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through 
their authorized representatives, records that pertain to transactions 
conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such 
records would pertain directly to the

[[Page 869]]

review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in connection with the 
performance of an EEP Agreement.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the certification of entry specified 
in Sec. 1494.401(f)(2), and must provide access to such document if 
requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or an authorized 
representative, for the five-year period specified in subparagraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Arrival verification reviews. CCC will review, on an annual 
basis, a sufficient number of exports made in connection with EEP 
Agreements to ensure that the eligible commodity which was exported 
pursuant to each such Agreement arrived in the eligible country 
specified in the Agreement.
    (d) Signatory on certifications. Any certification required from a 
person pursuant to this subpart or an Invitation must be signed by the 
person, if an individual, or by a partner or officer of the person, if 
the person is a partnership or a corporation, respectively.
    (e) Officials not to benefit. No member of or Delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, will participate or share in any of the 
benefits of any Agreement entered into pursuant to the EEP, but this 
provision may not be construed to extend to an Agreement made by CCC 
with a corporation for its general benefit.
    (f) Paperwork Reduction Act. The information collection requirements 
contained in this subpart have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 
35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0551-0028.
    (g) Waiver of irregularities. CCC reserves the right to waive any 
informality or minor irregularity with respect to any aspect of the 
operation of the EEP or any Agreement executed thereunder in order to 
best accomplish the purposes of the program.

<R05>
Sec. 1494.1100  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) Dairy Export Incentive Program 
(DEIP). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered together 
in order to select eligible commodities and eligible countries for DEIP 
initiatives which will best meet the program's objectives. The 
objectives of the program are to increase U.S. agricultural commodity 
exports and to encourage other countries exporting agricultural 
commodities to undertake serious negotiations on agricultural trade 
problems. Under the DEIP, bonuses are made available by CCC to enable 
exporters to meet prevailing world prices for targeted dairy products in 
targeted destinations. In the operation of the DEIP, CCC will make 
reasonable efforts to avoid the displacement of commercial export sales 
of U.S. dairy products and to ensure that sales facilitated by the DEIP 
are in addition to, and not in place of, any export sales of dairy 
products that the exporter would have otherwise made in the absence of 
the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1101  Criteria.

    The criteria considered in evaluating and approving proposals for 
the DEIP are those set forth in Sec. 1494.20 of this part.

Sec. 1494.1200  Program operations.

    This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the 
Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC). Under the DEIP, CCC facilitates the export of U.S. 
dairy products by paying bonuses to exporters which export U.S. dairy 
products to targeted markets in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of an Agreement entered into between the exporter and

[[Page 870]]

CCC. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the program 
operations provisions of subpart B of this part, relating to the Export 
Enhancement Program, will also apply to the DEIP. Any terms or 
conditions applicable to a particular Invitation for Offers (Invitation) 
under the DEIP, beyond those terms or conditions set forth in this 
subpart or subpart B of this part, will be specifically provided for in 
such Invitation.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1201  Paperwork Reduction Act.

<R05>
Sec. 1496.4  Issuance of invitations.

    From time to time, CCC will issue invitations to purchase or process 
agricultural products for utilization in the Title II, Pub. L. 480 
program. The invitations will specify the contract terms;

[[Page 871]]

the closing date for acceptance of bids; the date contracts will be 
awarded; and other pertinent information. Invitations will be issued at 
least 10 days prior to the deadline for submission of bids. The bid 
submission deadlines and contract awards will be timed so not more than 
one market day elapses between bid opening (bid submission deadline) and 
contract awards.


<R05>
Sec. 1496.5  Consideration of bids.

    (a)(1) Lowest landed cost. The general principle of awarding 
contracts that will result in the lowest landed cost will prevail. 
Lowest landed cost will be calculated on the basis of U.S. flag rates 
and service for that portion of the commodities being purchased that CCC 
determines is necessary and practicable to meet cargo preference 
requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the 
remaining portion of the commodities being purchased. However, the 
additional factors set forth in this section will be considered in 
awarding contracts.
    (b)(1) Availability of ocean service. Prior to receipt of offers 
from commodity suppliers, CCC will review ocean freight information from 
available sources including, but not limited to, trade journal 
newspapers, port publications, and steamship publications to determine 
the availability of appropriate ocean service.
    (2) Additional information will be gathered, if necessary by direct 
contact with the steamship company involved, regarding such factors as 
the minimum tonnage and/or revenue required to perform the service 
needed.
    (3) Special emphasis will be placed on assuring that under normal 
conditions the vessels will be calling at U.S. ports to coordinate 
loading with cargo arrival from suppliers.
    (4) Freight rates will be obtained from published ocean tariffs to 
make cost comparisons between various steamship companies and coastal 
ranges.
    (5) Available service will be analyzed to ensure that the port or 
coastal range selected for exportation has available ocean 
transportation service that will provide maximum compliance with the 
stated policy of AID with regard to the utilization of U.S. and other 
flag vessels to carry commodities shipped under Title II, Pub. L. 480.
    (c) Adequacy of service. (1) Prior to the selection of a coastal 
range or U.S. port from which commodities will be shipped, the ocean 
transportation service available may be examined to determine adequacy 
of service. The data utilized may include, but not necessarily be 
limited to, the past performance of a particular vessel or steamship 
line in terms of loss and/or damage to cargo when received at 
destination port; past performance in meeting established delivery 
schedules, etc. CCC may eliminate from consideration ports or coastal 
ranges where ocean transportation service is considered inadequate by 
CCC. When clearly superior service is available at another port or 
coastal range it may be selected over other service.
    (d) Port performance. (1) Each port will be contacted prior to bid 
evaluation to determine their cargo handling capabilities for Title II, 
Pub. L. 480, commodities when it is reasonably expected that quantities 
of 1,000 tons or more may be shipped. Allocations to that port will be 
governed by the minimum or maximum quantities indicated.
    (2) Limits of quantities purchased for delivery to a port or coastal 
range may also be imposed by the amount of vessel space available during 
the expected delivery and loading period.
    (3) Prior to the final selection of a U.S. port from which 
commodities will be shipped, the adequacy of the port to receive, 
accumulate, warehouse, handle, store, and protect the cargo will be 
considered.
    (4) Factors which will be considered in this determination will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the adequacy of building 
structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, 
cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices.
    (5) When it is determined that the U.S. port is congested, 
facilities are overloaded, and a vessel would not be able to dock and 
load cargo without delay, or when labor disputes or lack of labor will 
prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely

[[Page 872]]

manner, another coastal range or port will be considered.
    (e) Transit time. CCC will consider total transit time, as it 
relates to a final delivery date, in order to satisfy program 
requirements.
    (f) Great Lakes ports. (1) Commodities offered for delivery ``free 
alongside ship'' (f.a.s.) Great Lakes port range or intermodal bridge-
port Great Lakes port range that represent the overall (foreign and U.S. 
flag) lowest landed cost will be awarded on that basis. Such offers will 
not be reevaluated on a lowest landed cost U.S.-flag basis unless CCC 
determines that 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of bagged, 
processed or fortified commodities furnished under Title II of Public 
Law 480 has been, or will be, transported from the Great Lakes port 
range during that fiscal year.
    (2) CCC will consider commodity offers as offers for delivery 
``intermodal bridge-port Great Lakes port range'' only if:
    (i) The offer specifies delivery at a marine cargo-handling facility 
that is capable of loading ocean going vessels at a Great Lakes port, as 
well as loading ocean going conveyances such as barges and container 
vans, and
    (ii) The commodities will be moved from one transportation 
conveyance to another at such a facility.

[44 FR 27407, May 10, 1979, as amended at 52 FR 5729, Feb. 25, 1987; 63 
FR 11104, Mar. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1496.6  Data to be used.

    (a) CCC will use all available historical and current data as a 
basis for procurement considerations, including evaluations and 
decisions regarding the physical facilities and performance of ports. 
Heavy reliance will be placed upon current port conditions as determined 
from first hand observations and reports from USDA and other reliable 
sources.
    (b) The primary source of historical data will be documents used in 
the normal course of conducting business. Sources include contract 
documents, ocean bills of lading, survey and/or outturn reports made by 
commercial cargo surveyors, claim settlement agreements, claim payment 
documents, etc. CCC will utilize only such data and make only those 
analyses that it believes will provide a valid measure of program 
performance.


<R05>
Sec. 1496.7  Final contract determinations.

    The KCCO shall be responsible for making lowest landed cost 
determinations. KCCO shall provide that information to an Ad Hoc 
Committee designated by the Administrator, FSA, to review the lowest 
landed cost determinations as a result of any or all of the factors 
referred to herein. If, after the committee makes its review and it is 
recommended that contracts should be awarded based on the additional 
factors which would override lowest landed cost determinations, these 
recommendations will be presented to the Contracting Officer for a final 
decision. These decisions will be fully documented and explained as to 
the reasons the lowest landed cost was not selected.

<R05>
Sec. 1499.8  Ocean transportation.

    (a) Cargo preference. Shipments of commodities provided under either 
the section 416(b) or Food for Progress programs are subject to the 
requirements of sections 901(b) and 901b of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, regarding carriage on U.S.-flag vessels. CCC will endeavor to meet 
these requirements separately for each program for each 12-month 
compliance period. A Cooperating Sponsor shall comply with the 
instructions of CCC regarding the quantity of commodities that must be 
carried on U.S. flag vessels.
    (b) Freight procurement requirements. When CCC is financing any 
portion of the ocean freight, whether on U.S.-flag or non-U.S. flag 
vessels, and the Cooperating Sponsor arranges ocean transportation:
    (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange ocean transportation 
through competitive bidding and shall obtain approval of all invitations 
for bids from the offices specified in the Program Agreement prior to 
issuance.
    (2) Invitations for bids shall be issued through the Transportation 
News Ticker (TNT), New York, and at least one other comparable means of 
trade communication.
    (3) Freight invitations for bids shall include specified procedures 
for payment of freight, including the party responsible for the freight 
payments, and expressly require that:
    (i) Offers include a contract canceling date no later than the last 
contract layday specified in the invitation for bids;
    (ii) Offered rates be quoted in U.S. dollars per metric ton;
    (iii) If destination bagging or transportation to a point beyond the 
discharge port is required, the offer separately state the total rate 
and the portion thereof attributable to the ocean segment of the 
movement;
    (iv) Any non-liner U.S. flag vessel 15 years or older offer, in 
addition to any other offered rate, a one-way rate applicable in the 
event the vessel is scrapped or transferred to foreign flag registry 
prior to the end of the return voyage to the United States;
    (v) In the case of packaged commodities, U.S. flag carriers specify 
whether delivery will be direct breakbulk shipment, container shipment, 
or breakbulk transshipment and identify whether transshipment (including 
container relays) will be via U.S. or foreign flag vessel;
    (vi) Vessels offered subject to Maritime Administration approval 
will not be accepted; and
    (vii) Offers be received by a specified closing time, which must be 
the same for both U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels.
    (4) In the case of shipments of bulk commodities and non-liner 
shipments of packaged commodities, the Cooperating Sponsor shall open 
offers in public in the United States at the time and place specified in 
the invitation for bids and consider only offers that are responsive to 
the invitation for bids without negotiation. Late offers shall not be 
considered or accepted.
    (5) All responsive offers received for both U.S. flag and foreign 
flag service shall be presented to KCCO which will determine the extent 
to which U.S.-flag vessels will be used.
    (6) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish the Director, 
Public Law 480-OD, or other official specified in the Program Agreement, 
copies of all offers received with the time of receipt indicated 
thereon. The Director,

[[Page 877]]

Public Law 480-OD, or other official specified in the Program Agreement, 
will approve all vessel fixtures. The Cooperating Sponsor may fix 
vessels subject to the required approval; however, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall not confirm a vessel fixture until advised of the required 
approval and the results of the Maritime Administration's guideline rate 
review. The Cooperating Sponsor shall not request guideline rate advice 
from the Maritime Administration. The Cooperating Sponsor will, promptly 
after receipt of vessel approval, issue a public notice of the fixture 
details on the TNT or other means of communication approved by the 
Director, Public Law 480-OD.
    (7) Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers may not be employed to 
carry shipments on either U.S. or foreign-flag vessels.
    (8) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish the Director 
Public Law 480-OD, a copy of the signed laytime statement and statement 
of facts at the discharge port.
    (c) Shipping agents. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor may appoint a 
shipping agent to assist in the procurement of ocean transportation. The

Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1031, and include a copy 
of the proposed agency agreement. The Cooperating Sponsor shall specify 
the time period of the nomination.
    (2) The shipping agent so nominated shall submit the information and 
certifications required by 7 CFR 17.4 to the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) A person may not act as a shipping agent for a Cooperating 
Sponsor unless the Deputy Administrator has notified the Cooperating 
Sponsor in writing that the nomination is accepted.
    (d) Commissions. (1) When any portion of the ocean freight is paid 
by CCC, total commissions earned on U.S. and foreign flag bookings by 
all parties arranging vessel fixtures, shall not exceed 2\1/2\ percent 
of the total freight costs.
    (2) Address commissions are prohibited.
    (e) Contract terms. When CCC is paying any portion of the ocean 
freight, charter parties and liner booking contracts must conform to the 
following requirements, as applicable:
    (1) Packaged commodities on liner vessels shall be shipped on the 
basis of full berth terms with no demurrage or despatch;
    (2) Shipments of bulk liquid commodities may be contracted in 
accordance with trade custom. Other bulk commodities, including 
shipments that require bagging or stacking for the account of the 
vessel, shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load, free out, with 
demurrage and despatch applicable at load and discharge ports; except 
that, if bulk commodities require further inland distribution, they 
shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load with demurrage and despatch 
at load and berth terms discharge, i.e., no demurrage, despatch, or 
detention at discharge. Demurrage and despatch shall be settled between 
the ocean carrier and commodity suppliers at load port and between the 
ocean carrier and charterers at discharge ports. CCC is not responsible 
for resolving disputes involving the calculation of laytime or the 
payment of demurrage or despatch.
    (3) If the Program Agreement requires the Cooperating Sponsor to 
arrange an irrevocable letter of credit for ocean freight, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable for detention of the vessel for 
loading delays attributable solely to the decision of the ocean carrier 
not to commence loading because of the failure of the Cooperating 
Sponsor to establish such letter of credit. Charter parties and liner 
booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean 
carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention for 
all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, 
including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay 
shall not commence earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the 
designated loading port within the laydays specified in the charter 
party or liner booking contract, and upon notification of the vessel's 
readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the applicable charter 
party or liner booking contract. The period of such

[[Page 878]]

delay shall end at the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit 
have been established for ocean freight or the time the vessel begins 
loading, whichever is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not 
count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no 
later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.
    (4) Charges including, but not limited to charges for inspection, 
fumigation, and carrying charges, attributable to the failure of the 
vessel to present before the canceling date will be for the account of 
the ocean carrier.
    (5) Ocean freight is earned under a charter party when the vessel 
and cargo arrive at the first port of discharge, Provided, That if a 
force majeure prevents the vessel's arrival at the first port of 
discharge, 100% of the ocean freight is payable or, if the charter party 
provides for completing additional requirements after discharge such as 
bagging, stacking, or inland transportation, not more than 85% of the 
ocean freight is payable, at the time the General Sales Manager 
determines that such force majeure was the cause of nonarrival; and
    (6) When the ocean carrier offers delivery to destination ports on 
U.S.-flag vessels, but foreign-flag vessels are used for any part of the 
voyage to the destination port without first obtaining the approval of 
the Cooperating Sponsor, KCCO, and any other approval that may be 
required by the Program Agreement, the ocean freight rate will be 
reduced to the lowest responsive foreign-flag vessel rate offered in 
response to the same invitation for bids and the carrier agrees to pay 
CCC the difference between the contracted ocean freight rate and the 
freight rate offered by such foreign-flag vessel.
    (f) Coordination between CCC and the Cooperating Sponsor. When a 
Program Agreement specifies that the Cooperating Sponsor will arrange 
ocean transportation:
    (1) KCCO will furnish the Cooperating Sponsor, or its agent, with a 
Notice of Commodity Availability (Form CCC-512) which will specify the 
receiving country, commodity, quantity, and date at U.S. port or 
intermodal delivery point.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall complete the Form CCC-512 
indicating name of steamship company, vessel name, vessel flag and 
estimated time of arrival at U.S. port; and shall sign and return the 
completed form to KCCO, with a copy to the Director, P.L. 480-OD. If CCC 
agrees to pay any part of the ocean transportation for liner cargoes, 
the Cooperating Sponsor shall also indicate on the Form CCC-512 the 
applicable Federal Maritime Commission tariff rate, and tariff 
identification.
    (3) KCCO will issue instructions to have the commodity delivered 
f.a.s. or f.o.b. vessel, U.S. port of export or intermodal delivery 
point, consigned to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (g) Documents required for payment of freight--(1) General rule. To 
receive payment for ocean freight, the following documents shall be 
submitted to the Director, CCCPSD:
    (i) One signed copy of completed Form CCC-512;

been received from the Cooperating Sponsor; or
    (B) A request for direct payment to the ocean carrier, indicating 
amount due; or
    (C) A request for direct payment of ocean freight differential to 
the ocean carrier accompanied by a certification from the carrier that 
payment of the Cooperating Sponsor's portion of the ocean freight has

    (ix) Each request to CCC for payment must provide a document, on 
letterhead and signed by an official or agent of the requester, the name 
of the entity to receive payment, the bank ABA number to which payment 
is to be made; the account number for the deposit at the bank; the 
requester's taxpayer identification number; and the type of the account 
into which funds will be deposited.
    (2) In cases of force majeure. To receive payment in cases where the 
General Sales Manager determines that circumstances of force majeure 
have prevented the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall submit all documents required by paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section except for the notice of arrival required by 
paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (h) CCC payment of ocean freight or ocean freight differential--(1)

or liner booking note provide for the completion of additional services 
after discharge, such as bagging, stacking or inland transportation, CCC 
will pay, not later than 30 days after receipt in good order of the 
required documentation, either not more than 85 percent of the total 
freight charges or 100 percent of the ocean freight differential, 
whichever is specified in the Program Agreement. CCC will pay the 
remaining balance, if any, of the freight charges not later than 30 days 
after receipt of notification from the Cooperating Sponsor that such 
additional services have been provided; except that CCC will not pay any 
remaining balance where the GSM determines that the vessel's arrival at 
first port of discharge was prevented by force majeure.
    (3) No demurrage. CCC will not pay demurrage.

at port of entry or point of receipt from originating carrier in good 
condition until their distribution, sale or barter.
    (b) When CCC has agreed to pay costs of transporting, storing, and 
distributing commodities from designated points of entry or ports of 
entry, the Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for such services, by 
through bill of lading, or by contracting directly with suppliers of

directly with the suppliers of such services, the Cooperating Sponsor 
may seek reimbursement by submitting documentation to CCC indicating 
actual costs incurred. All supporting documentation must be sent to the 
Director, CCCPSD. CCC, at its option, will reimburse the Cooperating 
Sponsor for the cost of such services in U.S. dollars at the exchange 
rate in effect on the date of payment by CCC, or in foreign currency.

Sec. 1499.11  Agreement between Cooperating Sponsor and recipient agencies.

    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor shall enter into a written agreement 
with a recipient agency prior to the transfer of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income to the recipient agency. Copies of such 
agreements shall be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, 
and the Director, PDD. Such agreements shall require the recipient 
agency to pay the Cooperating Sponsor the value of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income that are used for purposes not expressly 
permitted under the Program Agreement, or that are lost, damaged, or 
misused as result of the recipient agency's failure to exercise 
reasonable care;
    (b) CCC may waive the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
where it determines that such an agreement is not feasible or 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.12  Sales and barter of commodities provided and use of proceeds.

    (a) Commodities may be sold or bartered without the prior approval 
of CCC where damage has rendered the commodities unfit for intended 
program purposes and sale or barter is necessary to mitigate loss of 
value.
    (b) A Cooperating Sponsor may, but is not required to, negotiate an 
agreement with the host government under which the commodities imported 
for a sale or barter may be imported, sold, or bartered without 
assessment of duties or taxes. In such cases and where the commodities 
are sold, they shall be sold at prices reflecting prevailing local 
market value.
    (c) The Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit all sale proceeds into an 
interest-bearing account unless prohibited by the laws or customs of the 
importing country or CCC determines that to do so would constitute an 
undue burden. Interest earned on such deposits shall only be used for 
approved activities.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the Cooperating 
Sponsor may use sale proceeds and resulting interest only for those 
purposes approved in the applicable Plan of Operation.
    (e) CCC will approve the use of sale proceeds and interest to 
purchase real and personal property where local law permits the 
Cooperating Sponsor to retain title to such property, but will not 
approve the use of sale proceeds or interest to pay for the acquisition, 
development, construction, alteration or upgrade of real property that 
is;
    (1) Owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged 
exclusively in religious activity, or
    (2) Used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes; except that, a 
Cooperating Sponsor may use such sale proceeds or interest to pay for 
repairs or rehabilitation of a structure located on such real property 
to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of provided 
commodities but only if such structure is not used in whole or in part 
for any religious or sectarian purposes while the provided commodities 
are stored in such structure. When not approved in the Plan of 
Operation, such use may be approved by the Agricultural Counsellor or 
Attache.
    (f) The Cooperating Sponsor shall follow commercially reasonable 
practices in procuring goods and services and when engaging in 
construction activity in accordance with the approved Plan of Operation. 
Such practices shall include procedures to prevent fraud, self-dealing 
and conflicts of interest, and shall foster free and open competition to 
the maximum extent practicable.
    (g) To the extent required by the Program Agreement, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall submit to the Controller, CCC, and to the Director, PDD, 
an inventory of all assets acquired with sale

[[Page 881]]

proceeds or interest or program income. In the event that its 
participation in the program terminates, the Cooperating Sponsor shall 
dispose, at the direction of the Director, PDD, of any property, real or 
personal, so acquired.

Sec. 1499.13  Processing, packaging and labeling of section 416(b) commodities in the foreign country.

    (a) Cooperating Sponsors may arrange for the processing of 
commodities provided under a section 416(b) Program Agreement, or for 
packaging or repackaging prior to distribution. When a third party 
provides such processing, packaging or repackaging, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall enter into a written agreement requiring that the provider 
of such services maintain adequate records to account for all 
commodities delivered and submit periodic reports to the Cooperating 
Sponsor. The Cooperating Sponsor shall submit a copy of the executed 
agreement to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache.
    (b) If, prior to distribution, the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for 
packaging or repackaging commodities provided under section 416(b), the 
packaging shall be plainly labeled in the language of the country in 
which the commodities are to be distributed with the name of the 
commodity and, except where the commodities are to be sold or bartered 
after processing, packaging or repackaging, to indicate that the 
commodity is furnished by the people of the United States of America and 
not to be sold or exchanged. If the commodities are not packaged, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall, to the extent practicable, display banners, 
posters or other media containing the information prescribed in this 
paragraph.
    (c) CCC will reimburse Cooperating Sponsors that are nonprofit 
private voluntary organizations or cooperatives for expenses incurred 
for repackaging if the packages of commodities provided under section 
416(b) are discharged from the vessel in damaged condition, and are 
repackaged to ensure that the commodities arrive at the distribution 
point in wholesome condition. No prior approval is required for such 
expenses equaling $500 or less. If such expense is estimated to exceed 
$500, the authority to repackage and incur such expense must be approved 
by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache in advance of repackaging.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.14  Disposition of commodities unfit for authorized use.

    (a) Prior to delivery to Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or 
point of entry. If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a 
governmental Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or point of entry 
overseas, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache will immediately arrange 
for inspection by a public health official or other competent authority. 
If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a nongovernmental 
Cooperating Sponsor at the discharge port or point of entry, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for such inspection. 
If inspection discloses the commodity to be unfit for the use authorized 
in the Program Agreement, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose of the commodities in 
accordance with the priority set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Expenses incidental to the handling and disposition of the damaged 
commodity will be paid by CCC from the sale proceeds or from an 
appropriate CCC account designated by CCC. The net proceeds of sales 
shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, 
for the credit of CCC in an appropriate CCC account designated by CCC; 
however, if the commodities are provided for a sales program, the net 
sale proceeds, net of expenses incidental to handling and disposition of 
the damaged commodity, shall be deposited to the special account 
established for sale proceeds. The Cooperating Sponsor shall consult 
with CCC regarding the inspection and disposition of commodities and 
accounting for sale proceeds in the event the Cooperating Sponsor 
executed a sales agreement under which title passed to the purchaser 
prior to delivery to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (b) After delivery to Cooperating Sponsor. (1) If after arrival in a 
foreign

[[Page 882]]

country and after delivery to a Cooperating Sponsor, it appears that the 
commodity, or any part thereof, may be unfit for the use authorized in 
the Program Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately arrange 
for inspection of the commodity by a public health official or other 
competent authority approved by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. 
If no competent local authority is available, the Agricultural Counselor 
or Attache may determine whether the commodities are unfit for the use 
authorized in the Program Agreement and, if so, may direct disposal in 
accordance with this paragraph (b) of this section. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall arrange for the recovery of that portion of the 
commodities designated during the inspection as suitable for authorized 
use. If, upon inspection, the commodity (or any part thereof) is 
determined to be unfit for the authorized use, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache of the circumstances 
pertaining to the loss or damage. With the concurrence of the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache, the commodity determined to be unfit 
for authorized use shall be disposed of in the following order of 
priority:
    (i) By transfer to an approved section 416(b) program for use as 
livestock feed. CCC shall be advised promptly of any such transfer so 
that shipments from the United States to the livestock feeding program 
can be reduced by an equivalent amount;
    (ii) Sale for the most appropriate use, i.e., animal feed, 
fertilizer, or industrial use, at the highest obtainable price. When the 
commodity is sold, all U.S. Government markings shall be obliterated or 
removed;
    (iii) By donation to a governmental or charitable organization for 
use as animal feed or for other non-food use; or
    (iv) If the commodity is unfit for any use or if disposal in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section is 
not possible, the commodity shall be destroyed under the observation of 
a representative of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, if 
practicable, in such manner as to prevent its use for any purpose.
    (2) Actual expenses incurred, including third party costs, in 
effecting any sale may be deducted from the sale proceeds and, if the 
commodities were intended for direct distribution, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall deposit the net proceeds with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, 
American Embassy, with instructions to credit the deposit to an 
appropriate CCC account as designated by CCC. If the commodities were 
intended to be sold, the Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit the gross 
proceeds into the special interest bearing account and, after approved 
costs related to the handling and disposition of damaged commodities are 
paid, shall use the remaining funds for purposes of the approved 
program. The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache a written report of all circumstances 
relating to the loss and damage on any commodity loss in excess of 
$5,000; quarterly reports shall be made on all other losses. If the 
commodity was inspected by a public health official or other competent 
authority, the report and any supplemental report shall include a 
certification by such public health official or other competent 
authority as to the condition of the commodity and the exact quantity of 
the damaged commodity disposed. Such certification shall be obtained as 
soon as possible after the discharge of the cargo. A report must also be 
provided to the Chief, Debt Management Division, KCMO/DMD, of action 
taken to dispose of commodities unfit for authorized use.

<R05>
Sec. 1499.15  Liability for loss, damage, or improper distribution of commodities--claims and procedures.

    (a) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor prior to loading on ocean vessel. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify KCCO, Chief, Export 
Operations Division if the Cooperating Sponsor will not have a vessel 
for loading at the U.S. port of export in accordance with the agreed 
shipping schedule. CCC will determine whether the commodity will be: 
moved to another available outlet; stored at the port for delivery to 
the

[[Page 883]]

Cooperating Sponsor when a vessel is available for loading; or disposed 
of as CCC may deem proper. The Cooperating Sponsor shall take such 
action as directed by CCC and shall reimburse CCC for expenses incurred 
if CCC determines that the expenses were incurred because of the fault 
or negligence of the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (b) Fault of others prior to loading on ocean vessel. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify the Chief, Debt Management 
Office, KCMO/DMD, when any damage or loss to the commodity occurs that 
is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier, or other person between the 
time title is transferred to a Cooperating Sponsor and the time the 
commodity is loaded on board vessel at the designated port of export. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly assign to CCC any rights to 
claims which may arise as a result of such loss or damage and shall 
promptly forward to CCC all documents pertaining thereto. CCC shall have 
the right to initiate claims, and retain the proceeds of all claims, for 
such loss or damage.
    (c) Survey and outturn reports related to claims against ocean 
carriers. (1) If the Program Agreement provides that CCC will arrange 
for an independent cargo surveyor to attend the discharge of the cargo, 
CCC will require the surveyor to provide a copy of the report to the 
Cooperating Sponsor.
    (2)(i) If the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for an independent cargo 
surveyor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall forward to the Chief, Debt 
Management Office, KCMO/DMD, any narrative chronology or other 
commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean 
transportation claims and shall prepare such a narrative in any case 
where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00. The 
Cooperating Sponsor may, at its option, also engage the independent 
surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs 
or port areas to the Cooperating Sponsor or its agent and to issue 
delivery survey reports thereon.
    (ii) In the event of cargo loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall provide to the Chief, Debt Management Office, KCMO/DMD, the names 
and addresses of individuals who were present at the time of discharge 
and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. For 
bulk grain shipments, in those cases where the Cooperating Sponsor is 
responsible for survey and outturn reports, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to:
    (A) Observe the discharge of the cargo;
    (B) Report on discharging methods including scale type, calibrations 
and any other factor which may affect the accuracy of scale weights, 
and, if scales are not used, state the reason therefore and describe the 
actual method used to determine weights;
    (C) Estimate the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge 
through carrier negligence;
    (D) Advise on the quality of sweepings;
    (E) Obtain copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing 
quantity discharged;
    (F) Provide immediate notification to the Cooperating Sponsor if 
additional services are necessary to protect cargo interests or if the 
surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not 
discharged; and
    (G) In the case of shipments arriving in container vans, list the 
container van numbers and seal numbers shown on the container vans, and 
indicate whether the seals were intact at the time the container vans 
were opened, and whether the container vans were in any way damaged. To 
the extent possible, the independent surveyor should observe discharge 
of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the 
container van occurred and arrange for surveying as container vans are 
opened.
    (iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCMO/DMD, Chief, 
Debt Management Office of all reports and documents pertaining to the 
discharge of commodities.
    (iv) CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for costs incurred 
upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other 
documents that establish the survey cost. CCC will not reimburse a 
Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of a delivery survey unless the 
surveyor also prepares a discharge survey, or for any other survey not

[[Page 884]]

taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless CCC 
determines that such action was justified in the circumstances.
    (3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless 
CCC determines that the use of competitive bids would not be 
practicable. CCC may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of 
conflicts of interest or lack of demonstrated capability to properly 
carry out surveying responsibilities.
    (4) If practicable, all surveys shall be conducted jointly by the 
surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report 
shall be signed by all parties.
    (d) Ocean carrier loss and damage. (1) Notwithstanding transfer of 
title, CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and retain the proceeds 
of collection from claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss 
and damage arising out of shipments of commodities provided to 
governmental Cooperating Sponsors; however, when the Cooperating Sponsor 
pays the ocean freight or a portion thereof, it shall be entitled to pro 
rata reimbursement received from any claims related to ocean freight 
charged. CCC will pay general average contributions for all valid 
general average incidents which may arise from the movement of commodity 
to the destination ports. CCC shall receive and retain all allowances in 
general average.
    (2) Nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors shall: file notice with the 
ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any cargo loss or damage; 
promptly initiate claims against the ocean carriers for such loss and 
damage; take all necessary action to obtain restitution for losses, and 
(iv) provide CCC copies of all such claims. Notwithstanding the 
preceding sentence the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor need not file 
a claim when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the 
loss is between $100 and $300 and the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor determines that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will 
exceed the amount of the claim. The nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor 
shall transmit to KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt Management Office information 
and documentation on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to 
be filed. In the event of a declaration General Average:
    (i) The Cooperating Sponsor shall assign all claim rights to CCC and 
shall provide CCC all documentation relating to the claim, if 
applicable;
    (ii) CCC will be responsible for settling general average and marine 
salvage claims;
    (iii) CCC has sole authority to authorize any disposition of 
commodities which have not commenced ocean transit or of which the ocean 
transit is interrupted;
    (iv) CCC will receive and retain any monetary proceeds resulting 
from such disposition;
    (v) CCC will initiate, prosecute, and retain all proceeds of cargo 
loss and damage against ocean carriers and any allowance in general 
average; and
    (vi) CCC will pay any general average or marine salvage claims 
determined to be due.
    (3) Amounts collected by nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors on 
claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained 
by the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor. On claims involving loss or 
damage of $200 or more, nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors may retain 
from collections received by them, either $200 plus 10 percent of the 
difference between $200 and the total amount collected on the claim, up 
to a maximum of $500; or the actual administrative expenses incurred in 
collection of the claim, provided retention of such administrative 
expenses is approved by CCC. Allowable collection costs shall not 
include attorneys fees, fees of collection agencies, and similar costs. 
In no event will CCC pay collection costs in excess of the amount 
collected on the claim.
    (4) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor also may retain from claim 
recoveries remaining after allowable deductions for administrative 
expenses of collection, the amount of any special charges, such as 
handling and packing costs, which the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor has incurred on the lost or damaged commodity and which are 
included in the claims and paid by the liable party.
    (5) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may redetermine claims on

[[Page 885]]

the basis of additional documentation or information not considered when 
the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information 
clearly changes the ocean carrier's liability. Approval of such changes 
by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of 
redetermined claims and supporting documentation or information shall be 
furnished to CCC.
    (6) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may negotiate compromise 
settlements of claims of any amount, provided that proposed compromise 
settlements of claims having a value of $5,000 or more shall require 
prior approval in writing by CCC. When a claim is compromised, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may retain from the amount 
collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, 
and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the special 
charges described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section as compromised 
amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is less than 
$600, a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may terminate collection 
activity when it is determined that pursuit of such claims will not be 
economically sound. Approval for such termination by CCC is not 
required; however, the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall notify 
KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt Management Division when collection activity on a 
claim is terminated.
    (7) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized in 
this section to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the purpose of 
determining the amount to be retained by a nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against ocean carriers, the 
word ``claim'' shall refer to the loss and damage to commodities which 
are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port 
destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the 
number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier.
    (8) If a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor is unable to effect 
collection of a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement 
within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof 
granted in writing by the party alleged responsible for the damage, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall assign its rights to the claim 
to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of legal action prior to 
the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. 
Generally, a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor should assign claim 
rights to CCC no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the 
period of limitation or any extension thereof. In all cases, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall keep CCC informed of the 
progress of its collection efforts and shall promptly assign their claim 
rights to CCC upon request. Subsequently, if CCC collects on or settles 
the claim, CCC shall, except as indicated in this paragraph pay to a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor the amount to which it would have 
been entitled had it collected on the claim. The additional 10 percent 
on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable, however, only if 
CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim 
prior to the assignment, or if payment is determined to be commensurate 
with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting the claim. If 
documentation requirements have not been fulfilled and the lack of such 
documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction of CCC, CCC 
will deny payment of all allowances to the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor.
    (9) When a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor permits a claim to 
become time-barred, or fails to take timely actions to insure the right 
of CCC to assert such claims, and CCC determines that the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor failed to properly exercise its 
responsibilities under the Agreement, the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor shall be liable to the United States for the cost and freight 
value of the commodities lost to the program.
    (e) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor in country of distribution. If a 
commodity, sale proceeds or program income is used for a purpose not 
permitted by the Program Agreement, or if a Cooperating Sponsor causes 
loss or damage to

[[Page 886]]

a commodity, sale proceeds, or program income through any act or 
omission or failure to provide proper storage, care and handling, the 
cooperating sponsor shall pay to the United States the value of the 
commodities, sale proceeds or program income lost, damaged or misused. 
CCC will consider normal commercial practices in the country of 
distribution in determining whether there was a proper exercise of the 
Cooperating Sponsor's responsibility. Payment by the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Fault of others in country of distribution and in intermediate 
country. (1) In addition to survey or outturn reports to determine ocean 
carrier loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor shall, in the case of 
landlocked countries, arrange for an independent survey at the point of 
entry into the recipient country and make a report as set forth in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will reimburse the Cooperating 
Sponsor for the costs of survey as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of 
this section.
    (2) Where any damage to or loss of the commodity or any loss of sale 
proceeds or program income is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier or 
other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort 
to pursue collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file 
or pursue such claims shall be liable to CCC for the value of the 
commodities or sale proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or 
misused: Provided, however, that the Cooperating Sponsor may elect not 
to file a claim if the loss is less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In 
addition, Cooperating Sponsors may, with the written approval of the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache, retain amounts to cover special costs 
of collection such as legal fees, or pay such collection costs with sale 
proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than the 
full amount of the claim requires prior approval by the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache. When the Cooperating Sponsor has exhausted all 
reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache to provide further instructions.
    (3) The Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial 
billings and at least three subsequent demands at not more than 30 day 
intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue legal action in the judicial system of 
country unless otherwise agreed by the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache. The Cooperating Sponsors must inform the Agricultural Counselor 
or Attache in writing of the reasons for not pursuing legal action; and 
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require the Cooperating 
Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its 
decision prior to granting approval. If the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further 
action on the claim, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the claim to 
CCC and shall forward all documentation relating to the claim to KCMO/
DMD.
    (4) As an alternative to legal action in the judicial system of the 
country with regard to claims against a public entity of the government 
of the cooperating country, the Cooperating Sponsor and the cooperating 
country may agree in writing to settle disputed claims by an appropriate 
administrative procedure or arbitration.
    (g) Determination of value. The Cooperating Sponsor shall determine 
the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged on the basis of the 
domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage 
occurred. When it is not feasible to determine such market price, the 
value shall be the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the 
commodity at the time and place of export, plus ocean freight charges 
and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to 
the Cooperating Sponsor. When the value is determined on a cost basis, 
the Cooperating Sponsor may add to the value any provable costs it has 
incurred prior to delivery by the ocean

[[Page 887]]

carrier. In preparing the claim statement, these costs shall be clearly 
segregated from costs incurred by the Government of the United States. 
With respect to claims other than ocean carrier loss or damage claims, 
the Cooperating Sponsor may request the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache to approve a commercially reasonable alternative basis to value 
the claim.
    (h) Reporting losses to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC 
designated representative. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly 
notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated 
representative, in writing, of the circumstances pertaining to any loss, 
damage, or misuse of commodities valued at $500 or more occurring within 
the country of distribution or intermediate country. The report shall be 
made as soon as the Cooperating Sponsor has adequately investigated the 
circumstances, but in no event more than ninety days from the date the 
loss became known to the Cooperating Sponsor. The report shall identify 
the party in possession of the commodities and the party responsible for 
the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantities of commodities; the 
size and type of containers; the time and place of misuse, loss, or 
damage; the current location of the commodity; the Program Agreement 
number, the CCC contract numbers, or if unknown, other identifying 
numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action taken by the 
Cooperating Sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the 
estimated value of the commodity. The report shall explain why any of 
the information required by this paragraph cannot be provided. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall also report the details regarding any loss or 
misuse of sale proceeds or program income.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall report quarterly to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache any loss, damage to or misuse of 
commodities resulting in loss of less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
shall inform the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated 
representative if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend 
in the loss, damage, or misuse of such commodities and submit a report 
as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, together with any 
other relevant information the Cooperating Sponsor has available to it. 
The Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require additional information 
about any commodities lost, damaged or misused.
    (i) Handling claims proceeds. Claims against ocean carriers shall be 
collected in U.S. dollars (or in the currency in which freight is paid) 
and shall be remitted (less amounts authorized to be retained) by 
Cooperating Sponsors to CCC. Claims against Cooperating Sponsors shall 
be paid to CCC in U.S. dollars. With respect to commodities lost, 
damaged or misused, amounts paid by Cooperating Sponsors and third 
parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the U.S. 
Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably in U.S. dollars with 
instructions to credit the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as 
determined by CCC, or in local currency at the highest rate of exchange 
legally obtainable on the date of deposit with instructions to credit 
the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC. With 
respect to sale proceeds and program income, amounts recovered may be 
deposited in the same account as the sale proceeds and may be used for 
purposes of the program.

Sec. 1499.16  Records and reporting requirements.

    (a) Records and reports--general requirements. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall maintain records for a period of three (3) years from the 
date of export of the commodities that accurately reflect the receipt 
and use of the commodities and any proceeds realized from the sale of 
commodities. The Government of the Exporting Country may, at reasonable 
times, inspect the Cooperating Sponsor's records pertaining to the 
receipt and use of the commodities and proceeds realized from the sale 
of the commodities, and have access to the Cooperating Sponsor's 
commodity storage and distribution sites and to locations of activities 
supported with proceeds realized from the sale of the commodities.
    (b) Evidence of export. The Cooperating Sponsor's freight forwarder 
shall,

[[Page 888]]

within thirty (30) days after export, submit evidence of export of the 
agricultural commodities to the Chief, Export Operations Division, KCCO. 
If export is by sea or air, the Cooperating Sponsor's freight forwarder 
shall submit five copies of the carrier's on board bill of lading or 
consignee's receipt authenticated by a representative of the U.S. 
Customs Service. The evidence of export must show the kind and quantity 
of agricultural commodities exported, the date of export, and the 
destination country.
    (c) Reports. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall submit a semiannual 
logistics report to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache and to the 
Director, CCC Program Support Division, FAS/USDA, Washington, DC 20250-
1031, covering the receipt of commodities. Cooperating sponsors must 
submit reports on Form CCC-620 and submit the first report by May 16 for 
agreements signed during the period, October 1 through March 31, or by 
November 16 for agreements signed during the period, April 1 through 
September 30. The first report must cover the time period from the date 
of signing and subsequent reports must be provided at six months 
intervals covering the period from the due date of the last report until 
all commodities have been distributed or sold and such distribution or 
sale reported to CCC. The report must contain the following data:
    (i) Receipts of agricultural commodities including the name of each 
vessel, discharge port(s) or point(s) of entry, the date discharge was 
completed, the condition of the commodities on arrival, any significant 
loss or damage in transit; advice of any claim for, or recovery of, or 
reduction of freight charges due to loss or damage in transit on U.S. 
flag vessels;
    (ii) Estimated commodity inventory at the end of the reporting 
period;
    (iii) Quantity of commodity on order during the reporting period;
    (iv) Status of claims for commodity losses both resolved and 
unresolved during the reporting period;
    (v) Quantity of commodity damaged or declared unfit during the 
reporting period; and
    (vi) Quantity and type of the commodity that has been directly 
distributed by the Cooperating Sponsor, distribution date, region of 
distribution, and estimated number of individuals benefiting from the 
distribution.

agency or upon a review conducted by the Cooperating Sponsor.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.18  Suspension of the program.

    All or any part of the assistance provided under a Program 
Agreement, including commodities in transit, may be suspended by CCC if:
    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor fails to comply with the provisions of 
the Program Agreement or this part;
    (b) CCC determines that the continuation of such assistance is no 
longer necessary or desirable; or
    (c) CCC determines that storage facilities are inadequate to prevent 
spoilage or waste, or that distribution of commodities will result in 
substantial disincentive to, or interference with, domestic production 
or marketing in the recipient country.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.19  Sample documents and guidelines for developing proposals and reports.

    CCC has developed guidelines to assist the Cooperating Sponsors in

than 92 degrees, divide the total sugar content by 0.972 (polarization x 
outturn weight/.972).
    (2) To adjust the raw value for sugar with polarization of 92 
degrees or above, multiply the polarization times 0.0175, subtract 0.68, 
and multiply the difference by the outturn weight (((polarization x 
0.0175)-0.68) x outturn weight).
    (3) To determine the quantity of refined sugar that must be 
transferred or exported to equal a corresponding quantity of entered raw 
sugar charged to a license, divide the quantity of entered raw sugar by 
1.07 (raw quantity/1.07).

<R05>
Sec. 1530.107  Bond or letter of credit requirements

    (a) The licensee may charge program sugar in anticipation of the 
transfer or export of refined sugar, the export of sugar in sugar 
containing products, or the production of certain polyhydric alcohols, 
if the licensee establishes a performance bond or a letter of credit 
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which meets the criteria set 
forth in this section.
    (b) The bond or letter of credit may cover entries made either 
during the period of time specified in the bond (a term bond) or for a 
specified entry (a single entry bond).
    (c) Only the licensee who will refine the sugar, manufacture the 
sugar containing product, or produce certain polyhydric alcohols may be 
the principal on the bond or letter of credit covering such sugar to be 
re-exported or used in the production of certain polyhydric alcohols. 
The surety or sureties shall be among those listed by the Secretary of 
the Treasury as acceptable on Federal bonds.
    (d) The obligation under the bond or letter of credit shall be made 
effective no later than the date of entry of the

[[Page 898]]

sugar for refiners or the date of transfer of the corresponding sugar 
for manufacture into a sugar containing product or certain polyhydric 
alcohols.
    (e) The amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be equal to 20 
cents per pound of sugar to be entered under the license.
    (f) If a licensee fails to qualify for credit to a license within 
the specified time period of the date of export or use of corresponding 
sugar in an amount sufficient to offset the charge to the license for 
that corresponding sugar, payment shall be made to the U.S. Treasury. 
The payment shall be equal to the difference between the Number 11 
contract price and the Number 14 contract price (New York Coffee, Sugar 
and Cocoa Exchange) in effect on the last market day before the date of 
entry of the sugar or the last market day before the end of the period 
during which export or use was required, whichever difference is 
greater. The difference shall be multiplied by the quantity of refined 
sugar, converted to raw value, that should have been exported in 
compliance with this part. If there was not a Number 11, or a Number 14 
contract price for the relevant market day, the Licensing Authority may 
estimate such price as he or she deems appropriate.

earliest transaction in the report for which credits or charges are 
being submitted. The licensee need not report when there have not been 
transactions during the reporting period.
    (b) Reports may be submitted by e-mail, U.S. mail, private courier, 
or in person, but must be in an integrated database format acceptable to 
the Licensing Authority. A copy of this format may be obtained from the 
Licensing Authority. Applicants unable to submit a report in the 
specified electronic format may seek a temporary waiver to permit them

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The determination of 
practicability will be made by the Administrator taking into account:

Administrator will inform the Secretary if the F.O.B. point of shipment 
price in Canada of such fresh fruit or vegetable exceeds, for five

   Subpart A--Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program and Cottonseed Oil 
                       Assistance Program Criteria

    Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5663.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.10  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program (SOAP) and Cottonseed Oil 
Assistance Program (COAP) administered by the Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered 
together in order to select eligible countries for SOAP and COAP 
initiatives which will best meet the programs' objective. The objective 
of the programs is to encourage the sale of additional quantities of 
sunflowerseed oil and cottonseed oil in world markets at competitive 
prices. Under the SOAP and the COAP, bonuses are made available by FAS 
to enable exporters to meet prevailing world prices for sunflowerseed 
oil and cottonseed oil in targeted destinations. In the operation of the 
SOAP and the COAP, FAS will make reasonable efforts to avoid the 
displacement of usual marketings of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.20  Criteria.

    The criteria considered by FAS in reviewing proposals for SOAP and 
COAP initiatives will include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) The expected contribution which initiatives will make toward 
realizing U.S. agricultural export goals and, in particular, in 
developing, expanding, or maintaining markets for U.S. sunflowerseed 
and/or cottonseed oil;
    (b) The subsidy requirements of proposed initiatives in relation to 
the sums made available to operate the programs in any given fiscal 
year; and
    (c) The likelihood that sales facilitated by initiatives would have 
the unintended effect of displacing normal commercial sales of 
sunflowerseed and/or cottonseed oil.


<R04>
             Subpart B--SOAP and COAP Drawback Certification

    Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5676.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.1100  Drawback certification.

    An offer submitted by an exporter to FAS for an export bonus under 
the SOAP or the COAP must contain, in addition to any other information 
required by FAS, a certification stating the following: ``None of the 
eligible commodity (sunflowerseed oil and/or cottonseed oil) has been or 
will be used as the basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant 
to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1313) of any duty, 
tax, or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or 
product.'' This certification must be signed by the exporter, if the 
exporter is an individual, or by a partner or officer of the exporter, 
if the exporter is a partnership or a corporation, respectively. FAS 
will reject any offer that does not contain the prescribed 
certification.
