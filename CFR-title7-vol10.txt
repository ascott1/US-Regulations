                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

as specifically as may be practicable; shall contain either the terms or 
substance of the proposed order or a description of the subjects and 
issues involved; and shall state the time and place of such hearing, and 
the place where copies of such proposed order may be obtained or 
examined. The time of the hearing shall not be less than 15 days after 
the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register, as 
provided herein, unless the Administrator shall determine that an 
emergency exists which requires a shorter period of notice, in which 
case the period of notice shall be that which the Administrator may 
determine to be reasonable in the circumstances: Except that in the case 
of hearings on amendments to an order, the time of the hearing may be 
less than 15 days but shall not be less than three days after the date 
of publication in the Federal Register.
    (b) Giving notice of hearing and supplemental publicity. (1) The 
Administrator shall give or cause to be given notice of hearing in the 
following manner:
    (i) By publication of the notice of hearing in the Federal Register;
    (ii) By mailing a copy of the notice of hearing to each organization 
known by the Administrator to be interested therein;

interested therein; and
    (iv) By forwarding copies of the notice of hearing addressed to 
those Governors of the States and executive heads of territories and 
possessions of the United States and the mayor of the District of 
Columbia that are directly affected by such order.
    (2) Legal notice of the hearing shall be deemed to be given if 
notice is given in the manner provided by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section; failure to give notice in the manner provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not affect the 
legality of the notice.
    (c) Record of notice and supplemental publicity. There shall be 
filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing an 
affidavit or certificate of the person giving the notice provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section. In regard to the

[[Page 9]]

provisions relating to mailing in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, 
determination by the Administrator that such provisions have been 
complied with shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the 
judge at the hearing. In the alternative, if notice is not given in the 
manner provided in paragraphs (b)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section there shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the 
judge at the hearing a determination by the Administrator that such 
notice is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest 
with a brief statement of the reasons for such determination. 
Determinations by the Administrator as herein provided shall be final.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.6  Docket number.

    Each proceeding, immediately following its institution, shall be 
assigned a docket number by the hearing clerk and thereafter the 
proceeding may be referred to by such number.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.7  Judge.

    (a) Assignment. No judge who has any pecuniary interest in the 
outcome of a proceeding shall serve as judge in such proceeding.
    (b) Power of judge. Subject to review by the Secretary, as provided 
elsewhere in this subpart, the judge in any proceeding shall have power 
to:
    (1) Rule upon motions and requests;
    (2) Change the time and place of hearings, and adjourn the hearing 
from time to time or from place to place;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;
    (4) Examine and cross-examine witnesses and receive evidence;
    (5) Admit or exclude evidence;
    (6) Hear oral argument on facts or law; and
    (7) Do all acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance 
of order at the hearings and the efficient conduct of the proceeding.
    (c) Who may act in absence of judge. In case of the absence of the 
judge or the judge's inability to act, the powers and duties to be 
performed by the judge under this part in connection with a proceeding 
may, without abatement of the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the 
Secretary, be assigned to any other judge.
    (d) Disqualification of judge. The judge may at any time withdraw as 
judge in a proceeding if such judge deems himself or herself to be 
disqualified. Upon the filing by an interested person in good faith of a 
timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of 
a judge, the Secretary shall determine the matter as a part of the 
record and decision in the proceeding, after making such investigation 
or holding such hearings, or both, as the Secretary may deem appropriate 
in the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.8  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. (1) All motions and requests shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during the course of the hearing 
may be filed with the judge or may be stated orally and made a part of 
the transcript.
    (2) Except as provided in Sec. 1200.17(b) such motions and requests 
shall be addressed to, and ruled on by, the judge if made prior to 
certification of the transcript pursuant to Sec. 1200.11 or by the 
Secretary if made thereafter.
    (b) Certification to Secretary. The judge may, in his or her 
discretion, submit or certify to the Secretary for decision any motion, 
request, objection, or other question addressed to the judge.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.9  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) Time and place. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
fixed in the notice of hearing, unless the judge shall have changed the 
time or place, in which event the judge shall file with the hearing 
clerk a notice of such change, which notice shall be given in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 1200.5 (relating to the giving of notice of 
the hearing): Except that if the change in time or place of hearing is 
made less than five days prior to the date previously fixed for the 
hearing, the judge either in addition to or in lieu of causing the 
notice of the change to be given, shall announce, or cause to be 
announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed for the 
hearing.
    (b) Appearances--(1) Right to appear. At the hearing, any interested 
person

[[Page 10]]

shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in person or through 
authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with respect to 
matters relevant and material to the proceeding. Any interested person 
who desires to be heard in person at any hearing under these rules 
shall, before proceeding to testify, state his or her name, address, and 
occupation. If any such person is appearing through a counsel or 
representative, such person or such counsel or representative shall, 
before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the hearing, 
state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or 
representative, and the names, addresses, and occupations of such person 
and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such counsel or 
representative shall give such other information respecting such 
appearance as the judge may request.
    (2) Debarment of counsel or representative. (i) Whenever, while a 
proceeding is pending before the judge, such judge finds that a person, 
acting as counsel or representative for any person participating in the 
proceeding, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge 
may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel 
or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be 
taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or 
suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Except that the judge may 
suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling 
the client to obtain other counsel or representative.
    (ii) In case the judge has ordered that a person be precluded from 
further action as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the judge 
within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the Secretary a 
report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order and shall 
recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other 
proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after 
notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings 
before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
    (3) Failure to appear. If any interested person fails to appear at 
the hearing, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to be 
heard in the proceeding.
    (c) Order of procedure. (1) The judge shall, at the opening of the 
hearing prior to the taking of testimony, have noted as part of the 
record the notice of hearing as filed with the Office of the Federal 
Register and the affidavit or certificate of the giving of notice or the 
determination provided for in Sec. 1200.5(c).
    (2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters 
specified in the notice of the hearing in such order as the judge shall 
announce.
    (d) Evidence--(1) General. The hearing shall be publicly conducted, 
and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.
    (i) Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or 
make affirmation. Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (ii) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the 
hearing, the judge may limit the number of times any witness may testify 
to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative 
evidence.
    (iii) The judge shall, insofar as practicable, exclude evidence 
which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not 
of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to any other ruling of the judge during the hearing, 
such party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon 
an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the 
judge. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon 
except as ordered by the judge. The ruling of the judge on any objection 
shall be a part of the transcript. Only objections made before the judge 
may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, when admissible for any

[[Page 11]]

purpose, shall be admissible as evidence without the presence of the 
person who made or prepared the same. The judge shall exercise 
discretion in determining whether an official publication of such record 
or document shall be necessary, or whether a copy would be permissible. 
If permissible such a copy should be attested to by the person having 
legal custody of it, and accompanied by a certificate that such person 
has the custody.
    (4) Exhibits. All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon satisfactory showing of 
authenticity, relevancy, and materiality, be numbered as exhibits and 
received in evidence and made a part of the record. Such exhibits shall 
be submitted in quadruplicate and in documentary form. In case the 
required number of copies is not made available, the judge shall 
exercise discretion as to whether said exhibits shall, when practicable, 
be read in evidence or whether additional copies shall be required to be 
submitted within a time to be specified by the judge. If the testimony 
of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report or document (including 
the record of any previous hearing), the judge, after inquiry relating 
to the identification of such statute, report, or document, shall 
determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and 
physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it 
shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and 
material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report or document 
(including the record of any previous hearing) containing immaterial or 
irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be 
excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the 
direction of the judge.
    (5) Official notice. Official notice at the hearing may be taken of 
such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United 
States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial 
fact of established character: Except that interested persons shall be 
given an adequate period of time, at the hearing or subsequent to it, of 
matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.
    (6) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a 
brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence 
consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be 
inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be 
considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the 
judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall 
not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such 
evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In 
the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the judge erred in 
excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing 
shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.10  Oral and written arguments.

    (a) Oral argument before the judge. Oral argument before the judge 
shall be in the discretion of the judge. Such argument, when permitted, 
may be limited by the judge to any extent that the judge finds necessary 
for the expeditious disposition of the proceeding and shall be reduced 
to writing and made part of the transcript.
    (b) Briefs, proposed findings, and conclusions. The judge shall 
announce at the hearing a reasonable period of time within which 
interested persons may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings and 
conclusions, and written arguments or briefs, based upon the evidence 
received at the hearing, citing, where practicable, the page or pages of 
the transcript of the testimony where such evidence appears. Factual 
material other than that adduced at the hearing or subject to official 
notice shall not be alluded to therein, and, in any case, shall not be 
considered in the formulation of the order. If the person filing a brief 
desires the Secretary to consider any objection made by such person to a 
ruling of the judge, as provided in Sec. 1200.9(d), that person shall 
include in the brief a

[[Page 12]]

concise statement concerning each such objection, referring, where 
practicable, to the pertinent pages of the transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.11  Certification of the transcript.

    The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing 
as soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written 
arguments, briefs, proposed findings, and proposed conclusions and shall 
furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be 
necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall 
transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the 
transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the 
exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. The 
judge shall attach to the original transcript of the testimony a 
certificate stating that, to the best of the judge's knowledge and 
belief, the transcript is a true transcript of the testimony given at 
the hearing, except in such particulars as the judge shall specify, and 
that the exhibits transmitted are all the exhibits as introduced at the 
hearing with such exceptions as the judge shall specify. A copy of such 
certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the transcript of 
testimony. In accordance with such certificate the hearing clerk shall 
note upon the official record copy, and cause to be noted on other 
copies of the transcript, each correction detailed therein by adding or 
crossing out (but without obscuring the text as originally transcribed) 
at the appropriate place any words necessary to make the same conform to 
the correct meaning, as certified by the judge. The hearing clerk shall 
obtain and file certifications to the effect that such corrections have 
been effectuated in copies other than the official record copy.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.12  Copies of the transcript.

    (a) During the period in which the proceeding has an active status 
in the Department, a copy of the transcript and exhibits shall be kept 
on file in the office of the hearing clerk where it shall be available 
for examination during official hours of business. Thereafter said 
transcript and exhibits shall be made available by the hearing clerk for 
examination during official hours of business after prior request and 
reasonable notice to the hearing clerk.
    (b) Transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at 
actual cost of duplication.

Administrator's proposed order and a brief in support of such 
exceptions. Such exceptions shall be in writing, shall refer, where 
practicable, to the related pages of the transcript, and may suggest 
appropriate changes in the proposed order.
    (d) Omission of recommended decision. The procedure provided in this 
section may be omitted only if the Secretary finds on the basis of the 
record that due and timely execution of the Secretary's functions 
imperatively and unavoidably requires such omission.

[[Page 13]]

persons, and (d) either (1) denial of the proposal to issue an order, or

of which shall be set forth and such order shall be complete except for 
its effective date and any determinations to be made under Sec. 
1200.16: Except that such order shall not be executed, issued, or made

<R05>
Sec. 1205.27  Participation in the sign-up period.

    The sign-up period will be from June 3, 2002, through August 30, 
2002. Those persons who favor the conduct of a continuance referendum 
and who wish to request that USDA conduct such a referendum may do so by 
submitting such request in accordance with this section. All requests 
must be received by the appropriate USDA office by August 30, 2002.
    (a) Before the sign-up period begins, FSA shall establish a list of 
known, eligible, Upland cotton producers in the county that it serves 
during the representative period, and shall also establish a list of 
known, eligible Upland cotton importers.
    (b) Before the start of the sign-up period, USDA shall mail a 
request form to each known, eligible, cotton importer. Importers who 
wish to request a referendum and who do not receive a request form in 
the mail by June 3, 2002, may participate in the sign-up period by 
submitting a signed, written request for a continuance referendum, along 
with a copy of a U.S. Customs form 7501 showing payment of a cotton 
assessment for calendar year 2001. Importers must submit their requests

in the sign-up period. Such person must be identified on FSA-578 during 
the representative period or provide documentation that demonstrates 
that the person was a cotton producer during the representative period. 
Cotton producers not listed on the FSA-578 shall submit at least one 
sales receipt for cotton they planted during the representative period. 
Cotton producers must make requests to the county FSA office where the 
producer's farm is located. If the producer's land is in more than one 
county, the producer shall make request at the county office where FSA 
administratively maintains and processes the producer's farm records. It 
is the responsibility of the person to provide the information needed by 
the county FSA office to determine eligibility. It is not the 
responsibility of the county FSA office to obtain this information. If 
any person whose name does not appear on the county FSA office list 
fails to provide at least one sales receipt for the cotton they produced 
during the representative period, the county FSA office shall determine 
that such person is ineligible to participate in the sign-up period, and 
shall note ineligible in the remarks section next to the person's name 
on the county FSA office sign-up sheet. In lieu of personally appearing 
at a county FSA office, eligible producers may request a sign-up form 
from the county FSA office where the producer's farm is located. If the 
producer's land is in more than one county, the producer shall make the 
request for the sign-up form at the county office where FSA 
administratively maintains and processes the producer's farm records. 
Such request must be accompanied by a copy of at least one sales receipt 
for cotton they produced during the representative period. The 
appropriate FSA office must receive all completed forms and supporting 
documentation by August 30, 2002.

    Any cotton producer organization within a cotton-producing State may 
request the Secretary for certification of eligibility to participate in 
nominating members and alternate members to represent such State on the 
Cotton Board. Such eligibility shall be

determination, including the following:
    (a) Geographic territory within the State covered by the 
organization's active membership;
    (b) Nature and size of the organization's active membership in the 
State, proportion of total of such active membership accounted for by 
farmers, a map showing the cotton-producing counties in such State in 
which the organization has members, the volume of cotton produced in 
each such county, the number of cotton producers in each such county, 
and the size of the organization's active cotton producer membership in 
each such county;
    (c) The extent to which the cotton producer membership of such 
organization is represented in setting the organization's policies;

the nomination of members for the Cotton Board. Any cotton producer 
organization found eligible by the Secretary under this Sec. 1205.341 
will be certified by the Secretary, and the Secretary's determination as 
to eligibility is final.

large number of cotton importers who import a relatively significant 
volume of cotton to reasonably warrant its participation in the 
nomination of members for the Cotton Board. Any importer organization 
found eligible by the Secretary under this Sec. 1205.342 will be

Sec. 1205.343  Suspension and termination.

    (a) The Secretary will, whenever the Secretary finds that this 
subpart or any provision thereof obstructs or does not tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the Act, terminate or suspend the 
operation of this subpart or such provision.
    (b) The Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time, and shall 
hold a referendum on request of 10 percent or more of the number of 
cotton producers and importers (if subject to the Order) voting in the 
most recent referendum, to determine whether cotton

[[Page 29]]

producers and importers subject to the Order favor the suspension or 
termination of this subpart, except that in counting such request for a 
referendum, not more than 20 percent of such request may be from 
producers from any one state or importers of cotton (if subject to the 
Order). The Secretary shall suspend or terminate such subpart at the end 
of the marketing year whenever the Secretary determines that its 
suspension or termination is approved or favored by a majority of 
producers and importers subject to the Order voting in such referendum 
who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary, have 
been engaged in the production or importation of cotton, and who 
produced and imported more than 50 percent of the volume of cotton 
produced and imported by those voting in the referendum.

Sec. 1205.510  Levy of assessments.

    (a) Producer assessments. An assessment of $1 per bale for cotton 
research and promotion is hereby levied on each bale of Upland cotton 
that is produced from cotton harvested and ginned except cotton consumed 
by any governmental agency from its own production. Such assessment 
shall be payable and collected only once on each bale.
    (1) A supplemental assessment for cotton research and promotion in 
addition to the $1 per bale assessment provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section, is hereby levied on each bale of Upland cotton harvested 
and ginned except cotton consumed by any governmental agency from its 
own production. The supplemental assessment rate shall be levied at the 
rate of five-tenths of one percent of:
    (i) The current value of the cotton multiplied by the number of 
pounds of lint cotton or;
    (ii) The current value of the cotton converted to a fixed amount per 
bale as reflected in the following assessment chart:

\1\ Assessment is calculated on \5/10\ of 1 percent of the midpoint of
  each 10[cent] increment, based on a 500 lb. bale and converted to a
  fixed amount per bale.

    (2) Each marketing year the collecting handler must select one of 
the two options for collecting the supplemental assessment as provided 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The handler shall notify the Cotton 
Board as to the method selected at the time the handler files the first 
handler report each marketing year.

[[Page 33]]

    (b) Importer assessment. An assessment for cotton research and 
promotion of $1 per bale is hereby levied on each bale of cotton, or the 
bale equivalent thereof for cotton in cotton-containing products 
identified in the HTS conversion factor table in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section and imported into the United States on or after July 31, 
1992. The $1 per bale assessment shall be converted to a fixed amount 
per kilogram to facilitate the U.S. Customs Service in collecting this 
assessment.
    (1) A supplemental assessment for cotton research and promotion in 
addition to the $1 per bale assessment provided for in paragraph (b) of 
this section is hereby levied on each bale of cotton or bale equivalent 
of cotton in cotton-containing products, identified in this subpart, 
imported into the United States on or after July 31, 1992. The 
supplemental assessment shall be levied at the rate of five-tenths of 
one percent of the historical value of cotton as determined by the 
Secretary and expressed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The rate of 
the supplemental assessment on imported cotton will be the same as that 
levied on cotton produced within the United States. The supplemental 
assessment will be calculated as a fixed amount per kilogram and added 
to the $1 per bale or bale equivalent assessment to facilitate the 
Customs Service in collecting assessments.
    (2) The 12-month average of monthly weighted average prices received 
by U.S. farmers will be calculated annually. Such weighted average will 
be used as the value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying the 
supplemental assessment on imported cotton and will be expressed in 
kilograms. The value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying this 
supplemental assessment is $0.8267 per kilogram.
    (3) The following table contains Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) 
classification numbers and corresponding conversion factors and 
assessments. The left column of the following table indicates the HTS 
classifications of imported cotton and cotton-containing products 
subject to assessment. The center column indicates the conversion factor 
for determining the raw fiber content for each kilogram of the HTS. HTS 
numbers for raw cotton have no conversion factor in the table. The right 
column indicates the total assessment per kilogram of the article 
assessed.
    (i) Any line item entry of cotton appearing on Customs entry 
documentation in which the value of the cotton contained therein results 
in the calculation of an assessment of two dollars ($2.00) or less will 
not be subject to assessments as described in this section.
    (ii) In the event that any HTS number subject to assessment is 
changed and such change is merely a replacement of a previous number and 
has no impact on the physical properties, description, or cotton content 
of the product involved, assessments will continue to be collected based 
on the new number.

or groups of States pursuant to Sec. 1207.322. Importer members shall 
be appointed from nominations submitted by importers pursuant to Sec. 
1207.322. The public member shall be nominated by Board members in such 
manner as recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary, and 
shall be appointed by the Secretary.
    (b) Producer membership upon the Board shall be determined on the 
basis of the potato production reported in the latest Crop Production 
Annual Summary Report issued by the Crop Reporting Board, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. Unless the Secretary, upon recommendation of 
the Board, determines an alternate basis, for each five million 
hundredweight of such production, or major fraction thereof, produced 
within each State, such State shall be entitled to one member. However, 
each State shall initially be entitled to at least one member.
    (c) The number of importer member positions on the Board shall be 
based on the hundredweights of potatoes, potato products equivalent to 
fresh potatoes, and seed potatoes imported into the United States but 
shall not exceed five importer members. Unless the Secretary, upon 
recommendation of the Board, determines an alternate basis, there shall 
be one importer member position for each 5 million hundredweight, or 
major fraction thereof, of potatoes, potato product equivalents, and 
seed potatoes imported into the United States.
    (d) Any State in which the potato producers fail to respond to an 
officially called nomination meeting may be combined with an adjacent 
State for the purpose of representation on the Board, in which case the 
Board's producer member selected by the Secretary will represent both 
States, but such member's voting power under Sec. 1207.325 shall not be 
increased.
    (e) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the Board, may establish, 
through rule making procedure, districts or groups of States in order to 
change the representation requirements for membership on the Board. In 
such event the voting power of members under Sec. 1207.325 would be 
based upon the total production within the new district or group of 
States.
    (f) Should the Board fail to nominate a public member, the Secretary 
may appoint such member.

Sec. 1207.322  Nominations and appointment.

    The Secretary shall select the producer, importer, and public 
members of the Board from nominations which may be made in the following 
manner.
    (a) A meeting or meetings of producers shall be held in each State 
to nominate producer members for the Board. For nominations to the 
initial Board the meetings shall be announced by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. The Department may call upon other organizations to assist 
in conducting the meetings such as State and national organizations of 
potato producers. Such nomination meetings shall be held not later than 
60 days after the issuance of this subpart. Any organization designated 
to hold such nomination meetings shall give adequate notice of such 
meetings to the potato producers affected; also to the Secretary so that 
a representative of the Secretary, if available, may conduct such 
meetings or act as secretary of such nomination meetings.
    (b) After the establishment of the initial Board, the nominations 
for subsequent Board producer members shall be made by producers at 
meetings in the producing sections or States. The Board shall hold such 
meetings, or cause them to be held, in accordance with rules established 
pursuant to recommendation of the Board.
    (c) Only producers may participate in designating producer nominees. 
Each producer is entitled to one vote only on behalf of himself, his 
partners, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and representatives for each 
position for which nominations are being held. If a producer is engaged 
in producing potatoes in more than one State, he shall elect the State 
in which he shall vote. In no event shall he vote in nominations in more 
than one meeting.
    (d) The importer members shall be nominated by importers of 
potatoes, potato products and/or seed potatoes. The number of importer 
members on the Board shall be announced by the Secretary and shall not 
exceed five members. The Board may call upon organizations of potato, 
potato products and/or seed potato importers to assist in nominating 
importers for membership on the Board. If such organizations fail to 
submit nominees or are determined by the Board to not adequately 
represent importers, then the Board may conduct meetings of importers to 
nominate eligible importers for Board member positions. In determining 
if importer organizations adequately represent importers, the Board 
shall consider:
    (1) How many importers belong to the association;
    (2) What percentage of the total number of importers is represented 
by the association;
    (3) Is the association representative of the potato, potato product, 
and seed potato import industry;
    (4) Does the association speak for potato, potato product, and seed 
potato importers; and
    (5) Other relevant information as may be warranted.
    (e) The public member shall be nominated by the producer and 
importer members of the Board. The public member shall have no direct 
financial interest in the commercial production or marketing of potatoes 
except as a consumer and shall not be a director, stockholder, officer 
or employee of any firm so engaged. The Board shall prescribe such 
additional qualifications,

administrative rules and procedures for selection and voting for each 
candidate as it deems necessary and the Secretary approves.

FR 44036, Aug. 26, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1207.511  Determination of assessable quantity.

    The assessable quantity of potatoes in any lot shall be determined 
on the basis of utilization. Assessments shall be due on the entire lot 
handled for human consumption, seed, or unspecified purposes if there is 
no accounting made on the basis of the utilization of such lot. However, 
if the accounting identifies all or portions of such lot on the basis of 
utilization, assessments shall be due only on that portion utilized for 
human consumption and seed.


<R05>
Sec. 1207.512  Designated handler.

    The assessment on each lot of potatoes produced in the 50 States of 
the United States and handled shall be paid by the designated handler as 
hereafter set forth.
    (a) Unless otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(8), (b), and (c) of 
this section, the designated handler shall be the first handler of such 
potatoes. The first handler is the person who initially performs a 
handler function as heretofore defined. Such person may be a fresh 
shipper, processor, or other person who first places the potatoes in the 
channels of commerce. A producer who grades, packs, or otherwise 
performs handler functions thereby becomes a handler and as such assumes 
first handler responsibilities under this part. The following examples 
are provided to aid in identification of first handlers who are 
designated handlers:
    (1) Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a 
handler for preparation for market. The handler in this instance is the 
designated handler, regardless of whether he subsequently handles such 
potatoes for his own account or for the account of the producer.
    (2) Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a 
handler who takes title to such potatoes and places them in storage for 
subsequent handling. The handler who purchases such potatoes from the 
producer is the designated handler.
    (3) Producer delivers field-run potatoes to a commercial storage 
facility for the purpose of holding such potatoes under his own account 
for later sale. There is no designated handler in this instance since 
such potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no 
assessment is due. The designated handler of such potatoes would be 
identified on the basis of subsequent handling of such potatoes.
    (4) Fresh shipper purchases a lot of potatoes from a producer, packs 
a portion of such potatoes for fresh market, and delivers the balance to 
a processor. The fresh shipper is the designated handler for all 
potatoes in the lot.
    (5) Handler purchases potatoes from a producer's field or storage 
for the purpose of preparing such potatoes for market or for 
transporting such potatoes to storage for subsequent handling. The 
handler who purchases such potatoes from the producer is the designated 
handler.
    (6) Producer packs and sells potatoes of his own production from the 
field, roadside stand, or storage to a consumer, itinerant trucker, or 
other buyer. In performing such handler functions the producer assumes 
the responsibility of designated handler.
    (7) Processor utilizes potatoes of his own production in the 
manufacture of potato chips, frozen, dehydrated, or canned products for 
human consumption. In so handling potatoes, the proc essor assumes the 
responsibility of designated handler.
    (8) Producer utilizes potatoes of his own production for seed in 
planting his subsequent crop. Such seed potatoes do not enter the 
current of commerce; there is no designated handler in this instance 
since the potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no 
assessment is due. However, seed potatoes sold or shipped to other 
producers for planting or to other persons for subsequent disposition 
enter the current of commerce and are subject to

[[Page 71]]

assessment. The producer of seed potatoes shall be the designated 
handler of such potatoes shipped to other producers for planting and the 
assessment is due when he first sells or otherwise handles such 
potatoes. The first person who acquires seed potatoes from the producer 
thereof for subsequent disposition other than planting by said person 
shall be the designated handler of such potatoes. However, the seed 
producer will be the designated handler responsible for filing reports 
and making payments, unless he can show that the first person who 
obtained the potatoes from him disposed of them other than by planting. 
To show this the seed producer must submit to the Potato Board the name 
and address of the first person who obtained the potatoes from him and 
an invoice of sale or settlement sheet on which it is indicated that 
such person will be the designated handler and therefore will be 
responsible for the payment of the assessments. Only by showing this is 
the seed producer no longer considered the designated handler and 
therefore not liable for the assessments.
    (b) Any person who handles potatoes for a producer thereof under 
oral or written contract or agreement providing for the sale thereof 
shall be the designated handler for such potatoes, notwithstanding the 
fact that the producer may have graded, packed, or otherwise handled 
such potatoes and thereby became the first handler of such potatoes.
    Examples. A cooperative marketing association, or other person, who 
makes an accounting to the producer, or pay the proceeds of the sale to 
the producer would be the designated handler responsible for the 
assessment.
    (c) Any processor who purchases potatoes from the producer thereof 
shall be the designated handler even though the producer may have 
graded, packed, or otherwise handled such potatoes and thereby became 
the first handler of such potatoes.

<R05>
Sec. 1207.513  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Time of payment. The assessment on domestically produced 
potatoes shall become due at the time a determination of assessable 
potatoes is made in the normal handling process, pursuant to Sec. 
1207.511. If no determination is made of the utilization of a lot, 
assessments shall be due on the entire lot when it enters the current of 
commerce. The assessment on imported potatoes, potato products, and seed 
potatoes shall become due at the time of entry, or withdrawal, for 
consumption into the United States.
    (b) Responsibility for payment. (1) The designated handler is 
responsible for payment of the assessment on domestically produced 
potatoes. He may pay with no reimbursement from the producer. In the 
alternative, he may collect the assessment from the producer, or deduct 
such assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer on whose potatoes 
the assessment is made, provided he furnishes the producer with evidence 
of such payment. Any such collection or deduction of assessment shall be 
made not later than the time when the assessment becomes payable by the 
handler to the Board. Failure of the handler to collect or deduct such 
assessment does not relieve the handler of his obligation to remit the 
assessment to the Board.
    (2) The Customs Service shall collect payment of assessment on 
imported potatoes, potato products, and seed potatoes from importers and 
forward such assessment per agreement between the Customs Service and 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Importers shall be responsible for 
payment of assessment directly to the Board of any assessment due but 
not collected by the Customs Service at the time of entry, or 
withdrawal, for consumption into the United States. An importer may 
apply to the Board for reimbursement of assessments paid on exempted 
products.
    (c) Payment directly to the Board. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, each designated handler or 
importer shall remit assessments directly to the Board by check, draft, 
or money order payable to the National Potato Promotion Board, or NPPB, 
not later than 10 days after the end of the month such assessment is due 
together with a report (preferably on Board forms) thereon.

[[Page 72]]

    (2) All designated handlers, including a designated handler whose 
own production is handled and assessments to the Board paid by another 
designated handler, shall report to the Board:
    (i) Date of report (which is also date of payment to the Board).
    (ii) The name and address of the designated handler;
    (iii) The period potatoes were handled;
    (iv) The total quantity of potatoes determined to be assessable 
during the period potatoes were handled, pursuant to Sec. 1207.511.
    (3) Designated handlers who collect assessments from producers or 
withhold assessments from their accounts or pay the assessment 
themselves shall also include a list of all such producers whose 
potatoes were handled during the period, their addresses and the total 
assessable quantities handled for each such producer.
    (i) In lieu of such a list, the designated handler may substitute 
authentic copies of settlement sheets given to each producer provided 
such settlement sheets contain all the information listed above.
    (ii) The words ``final report'' shall be shown on the last report at 
the close of his marketing season or at the end of each fiscal period if 
such handler markets potatoes on a year-round basis.
    (4) Prepayment of assessment: (i) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
and reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Board 
may permit designated handlers to make advance payments of their total 
estimated assessments for the season to the Board prior to their actual 
determination of assessable potatoes. Such procedure may be permitted 
when it is considered by the designated handler to be the more practical 
method of payment.
    (ii) Persons using such procedure shall provide a final annual 
accounting of actual handling and assessments.
    (iii) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board upon request.
    (d) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may authorize 
other organizations to collect assessments in its behalf. In any State 
or area in which the Board has negotiated an agreement to collect 
assessments with an agency such as a State Potato Commission or a Potato 
Association approved by the Secretary, the designated handler shall pay 
the assessment to such agency in the time and manner, and with such 
identifying information as specified in such agreement. Such an 
agreement shall not provide any cooperating agency with authority to 
collect confidential information from handlers; to qualify, the 
cooperating agency must on its own accord have access to all information 
required by the Board for collection purposes. If the Board requires 
further evidence of payment than provided, it may acquire such evidence 
from individual designated handlers.
    (1) All such agreements are subject to the requirement of Sec. 
1207.352 Confidential treatment, of the plan, the provisions of section 
310(c) of the Act, and all applicable rules and regulations and 
financial safeguards in effect under the Act and the plan; and all 
affected persons shall agree to, and conduct their operations and 
activities in accordance with, such requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 1209.30  Establishment and membership.

    (a) There is hereby established a Mushroom Council of not less than 
four or more than nine members. The Council shall be composed of 
producers appointed by the Secretary under Sec. 1209.33, except that, 
as provided in paragraph (c), importers shall be appointed by the 
Secretary to the Council under Sec. 1209.33 once imports, on average, 
reach at least 35,000,000 pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (b) For purposes of nominating and appointing producers to the 
Council, the United States shall be divided into four geographic regions 
and the number of Council members from each region shall be as follows:
    (1) Region 1: including Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, 
Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, 
Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, and 
Wyoming--2 Members.
    (2) Region 2: including Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, the 
District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland--3 Members.
    (3) Region 3: including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, 
California, Nevada, Alaska, and Hawaii--3 Members.
    (4) Region 4: including New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, 
Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Florida, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico--1 Member.
    (c) Importers shall be represented by a single, separate region, 
referred to as Region 5, consisting of the United States as defined in 
Sec. 1209.21(b) when imports, on average, equal or exceed 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (d) At least every five years, and not more than every three years, 
the Council shall review changes in the geographic distribution of 
mushroom production volume throughout the United States and import 
volume, using the average annual mushroom production and imports over 
the preceding four years, and, based on such review, shall recommend to 
the Secretary reapportionment of the regions established in paragraph 
(b), or modification of the number of members from such regions, as 
determined under the rules established in paragraph (e), or both, as 
necessary to best reflect the geographic distribution of mushroom 
production volume in the United States and representation of imports, if 
applicable.
    (e) Subject to the nine-member maximum limitation, the following 
procedure will be used to determine the number of members for each 
region to serve on the Council under paragraph (d):
    (1) Each region that produces, on average, at least 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually shall be entitled to one representative on 
the Council.
    (2) As provided in paragraph (c), importers shall be represented by 
a single, separate region, which shall be entitled to one 
representative, if such region imports, on average, at least 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (3) Each region shall be entitled to representation by an additional 
Council member for each 50,000,000 pounds of annual production or 
imports, on average, in excess of the initial 35,000,000 pounds required 
to qualify the region for representation.
    (4) Should, in the aggregate, regions be entitled to levels of 
representation under paragraphs (e) (1), (2) and (3) that would exceed 
the nine-member limit on the Council under the Act, the regions shall be 
entitled to representation on the Council as follows:
    (i) Each region first shall be assigned one representative on the 
Council pursuant to paragraphs (e) (1) and (2).
    (ii) Then, each region with 50,000,000 pounds of annual production 
or imports, on average, in excess of the initial 35,000,000 pounds 
required to qualify the region for representation shall be assigned one 
additional representative on the Council, except that if under such 
assignments all five regions, counting importers as a region, if 
applicable, would be entitled to additional representatives, that region 
with the smallest on-average volume, in terms of production or imports, 
will

[[Page 77]]

not be assigned an additional representative.
    (iii) After members are assigned to regions under paragraphs (e)(4) 
(i) and (ii), if less than the entire nine seats on the Council have 
been assigned to regions, the remaining seats on the Council shall be 
assigned to each region for each 50,000,000 pound increment of annual 
production or import volume, on average, in excess of 85,000,000 pounds 
until all the seats are filled. It for any such 50,000,000 pound 
increment, more regions are eligible for seats than there are seats 
available, the seat or seats assigned for such increment shall be 
assigned to that region or those regions with greater on-average 
production or import volume than the other regions otherwise eligible at 
that increment level.
    (f) In determining the volume of mushrooms produced in the United 
States or imported into the United States for purposes of this section, 
the Council and the Secretary shall:
    (1) Only consider mushrooms produced or imported by producers and 
importers, respectively, as those terms are defined in Sec. Sec. 1209.8 
and 1209.15; and
    (2) Use the information received by the Council under Sec. 1209.60, 
and data published by the Department.
    (g) For purposes of the provisions of this section relating to the 
appointment of producers and importers to serve on the Council, the term 
producer or importer refers to any individual who is a producer or 
importer, respectively, or if the producer or importer is an entity 
other than an individual, an individual who is an officer or employee of 
such producer or importer.

    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e), nominations for each 
position shall be made by regional caucus in the region entitled to 
nominate for such position. Notice of such caucus shall be publicized to 
all producers or importers within the region, and to the Secretary, at 
least 30 days prior to the caucus. The notice shall have attached to it 
the call for nominations from the Council and the Department's equal 
opportunity policy. Except with respect to nominations for the initial 
appointments to the Council, the responsibility for convening and 
publicizing the regional caucus shall be that of the Council.
    (2) All producers or importers within the region may participate in 
the caucus. However, if a producer is engaged in the production of 
mushrooms in more than one region or is also an importer, such person's 
participation within a region shall be limited to one

[[Page 78]]

vote and shall only reflect the volume of such person's production or 
imports within the applicable region.
    (3) The regional caucus shall conduct the selection process for the 
nominees in accordance with procedures to be adopted at the caucus 
subject to the following requirements:
    (i) There shall be two individuals nominated for each open position.
    (ii) Each nominee shall meet the qualifications set forth in the 
call.
    (iii) If a producer nominee is engaged in the production of 
mushrooms in more than one region or is also an importer, such 
individual shall participate within the region that such individual so 
elects in writing to the Council and such election shall remain 
controlling until revoked in writing to the Council.
    (e) After the regional caucuses for the initial Council, the Council 
may conduct the selection of nominees by mail ballot in lieu of a 
regional caucus.
    (f) When producers or importers are voting for nominees to the 
Council, whether through a regional caucus or a mail ballot, the 
following conditions shall apply:
    (1) Voting for any open position shall be on the basis of:
    (i) One vote per eligible voter; and
    (ii) Volume of on-average production or imports of the eligible 
voter within that region.
    (2) Whenever the producers or importers in a region are choosing 
nominees for one open position on the Council, the proposed nominee with 
the highest number of votes cast and the proposed nominee with the 
highest volume of production or importers voted shall be the nominees 
submitted to the Secretary. If a proposed nominee receives both the 
highest number of votes cast and the highest volume of production or 
imports voted, then the proposed nominee with the second highest number 
of votes cast shall be a nominee submitted to the Secretary along with 
such proposed nominee receiving both the highest number of votes cast 
and the highest volume of production or imports voted.
    (3) Whenever the producers or importers in a region are choosing 
nominees for more than one open position on the Council at the same 
time, the number of the nominations submitted to the Secretary shall 
equal twice the number of such open positions, and for each open 
position shall consist of the proposed nominee with the highest number 
of votes cast and the proposed nominee with the highest volume of 
production or imports voted with respect to that position, subject to 
the rule set out in paragraph (f)(2). An individual shall only be 
nominated for one such open position.
    (4) Voters shall certify on their ballots as to their on-average 
production or import volume within the region involved. Such 
certification may be subject to verification.

insufficient nominees from which to appoint members to the Council as a 
result of the Secretary's rejecting such nominees, additional nominees 
shall be submitted to the Secretary under the procedures set out in this 
section.
    (2) Whenever producers or importers in a region cannot agree on 
nominees for an open position on the Council under the preceding 
provisions of this section, or whenever they fail to nominate 
individuals for appointment to the Council, the Secretary may appoint 
members in such manner as the Secretary, by regulation, determines 
appropriate.

Council, the term of office for each member of the Council shall begin 
on January 1 or such other date that may be approved by the Secretary.

made more acceptable. However, as prescribed by the Act, nothing in this 
subpart may be construed to authorize mandatory requirements for quality 
control, grade standards, supply management programs, or other programs 
that would control production or otherwise limit the right of individual 
producers to produce mushrooms.
    (b) No program, plan, or project shall be implemented prior to its 
approval by the Secretary. Once a program, plan, or project is so

shall be reviewed or evaluated periodically by the Council to ensure 
that it contributes to an effective program of promotion, research, 
consumer information, or industry information. If it is found by the 
Council that any such program, plan, or project does not contribute to 
an effective program of promotion, research, consumer information, or 
industry information, then the Council shall terminate such program, 
plan, or project.
    (d) In carrying out any program, plan, or project, no reference to a 
brand name, trade name, or State or regional identification of any 
mushrooms or mushroom product shall be made. In addition, no program, 
plan, or project shall make use of unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
with respect to the quality, value, or use of any competing product.

approximately one fiscal year's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used 
to defray any expenses authorized under this subpart.

for the payment of administrative expenses, subject to the same fiscal,

    (e) A late payment charge shall be imposed on any first handler or 
importer who fails to make timely remittance to the Council of the total 
assessment amount for which the person is liable. Such late payment 
charge shall be imposed on any assessments not received by the last day 
of the month following the month in which the mushrooms involved were 
marketed or, in the case of imports, not collected by the U.S. Customs 
Service at the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the 
United States. This one-time late payment charge shall be 10 percent of 
the assessments due before interest charges have accrued. The late 
payment charge will not be applied to any late payments postmarked 
within 15 days after the end of the month such assessments are due.

[[Page 90]]

    (f) In addition to the late payment charge, interest shall be 
charged at a rate of one and one-half percent per month on the 
outstanding balance, including the late payment charge and any accrued 
interest, of any account that remains delinquent beyond the last day of 
the second month following the month the mushrooms involved were 
marketed. However, first handlers paying their assessments, in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, will not be subject to 
the one and one-half percent per month interest under this paragraph 
until the last day of the second month after such assessments are due 
under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. In the case of imports, such a 
rate of interest will be charged to any account that remains delinquent 
on any assessments not collected by the U.S. Customs Service at the time 
of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the United States. Such a 
rate of interest will continue to be charged monthly until the 
outstanding balance is paid to the Council.
    (g) Any assessment determined by the Council at a date later than 
prescribed by this section, because of a person's failure to submit a 
report to the Council when due, shall be considered to have been payable 
by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed on time. 
A late payment charge and monthly interest charges on the outstanding 
balance shall be applicable to such unpaid assessment in accordance with 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
    (h) In lieu of the monthly assessment payment and reporting 
requirements of Sec. 1209.260 of this subpart and Sec. 1209.60 of this 
part, the Council may permit a first handler to make advance payment of 
the total estimated assessment amount due to the Council for the ensuing 
fiscal year, or portion thereof, prior to the actual determination of 
assessable mushrooms.
    (1) Each person shall provide an initial report estimating 
assessable mushrooms. The Council may request additional information on 
such estimate.
    (2) Each person shall provide a final report of actual marketings 
during the period involved and remit any unpaid assessments not later 
than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the period 
covered.
    (3) Any person whose prepayment exceeds the amount paid shall be 
reimbursed for the amount of overpayment. The Council shall not, in any 
case, be obligated to pay interest on any advance payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.252  Exemption procedures.

    (a) Any person who produces or imports, on average, 500,000 pounds 
or less of mushrooms annually and who desires to claim an exemption from 
assessments during a fiscal year as provided in Sec. 1209.52 of this 
part shall apply to the Council, on a form provided by the Council, for 
a certificate of exemption. Such persons shall certify that their 
production or importation of mushrooms shall not exceed 500,000 pounds, 
on average, for the fiscal year for which the exemption is claimed. 
Pursuant to this section, the term on average shall be calculated by 
averaging a person's estimated production or importation for the fiscal 
year for which an exemption is claimed with such person's production or 
importation in the preceding fiscal year.
    (b) On receipt of an application, the Council shall determine 
whether an exemption may be granted. The Council then will issue, if 
deemed appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person that is 
eligible to receive one. Each person who is exempt from assessment must 
provide an exemption number to the first handler in order not to be 
subject to collection of an assessment on mushrooms. First handlers and 
importers, except as otherwise authorized by the Council, shall maintain 
records showing the exemptee's name and address along with the exemption 
number assigned by the Council. Importers who are exempt from assessment 
shall be eligible for reimbursement of assessments collected by the U.S. 
Customs Service and shall apply to the Council for reimbursement of such 
assessments paid.
    (c) Any person who desires to renew the exemption from assessments 
for a subsequent fiscal year shall reapply to the Council, on a form 
provided by the Council, for a certificate of exemption.

[[Page 91]]

    (d) The Council may require persons receiving an exemption from 
assessments to provide to the Council reports on the disposition of 
exempt mushrooms.

    Each first handler shall be required to report monthly to the 
Council such information as may be required under Sec. 1209.60(a) of 
this part. In addition, each first handler shall be required to provide 
the tax identification number or social security number of each producer 
the first handler has dealt with during the time period covered by the 
report.

Subpart C_Procedure for the Conduct of Referenda in Connection With the 
      Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Order

    Source: 62 FR 66975, Dec. 23, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.300  General.

    A referendum to determine whether eligible producers and importers 
favor continuation of the Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer 
Information Order shall be conducted in accordance with these 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.301  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise defined below, the definition of terms used in 
these procedures shall have the same meaning as the definitions in the 
Order.
    (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Agricultural 
Marketing Service, with power to redelegate, or any officer or employee 
of the Department to whom authority has been delegated or may hereafter 
be delegated to act in the Administrator's stead.
    (b) Order means the Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer 
Information Order, including an amendment to the Order.
    (c) Referendum agent or agent means the individual or individuals 
designated by the Secretary to conduct the referendum.
    (d) Representative period means the period designated by the 
Secretary.
    (e) Person means any individual, group of individuals, partnership, 
corporation, association, cooperative, or any other legal entity. For 
the purpose of this definition, the term ``partnership'' includes, but 
is not limited to:
    (1) A husband and wife who have title to, or leasehold interest in, 
mushroom production facilities and equipment as tenants in common, joint 
tenants, tenants by the entirety, or, under community property laws, as 
community property, and
    (2) So-called ``joint ventures'', wherein one or more parties to the 
agreement, informal or otherwise, contributed capital and others 
contributed labor, management, equipment, or other services, or any 
variation of such contributions by two or more parties so that it 
results in the production or importation of fresh mushrooms and the 
authority to transfer title to the mushrooms so produced or imported.
    (f) Eligible producer means any person or entity defined as a 
producer who produces, on average, over 500,000 pounds annually of fresh 
mushrooms during the representative period and who:
    (1) Owns or shares in the ownership of mushroom production 
facilities and equipment resulting in the ownership of the mushrooms 
produced;
    (2) Rents mushroom production facilities and equipment resulting in 
the ownership of all or a portion of the mushrooms produced;

[[Page 92]]

    (3) Owns mushroom production facilities and equipment but does not 
manage them and, as compensation, obtains the ownership of a portion of 
the mushrooms produced; or
    (4) Is a party in a landlord-tenant relationship or a divided 
ownership arrangement involving totally independent entities cooperating 
only to produce mushrooms who share the risk of loss and receive a share 
of the mushrooms produced. No other acquisition of legal title to 
mushrooms shall be deemed to result in persons becoming eligible 
producers.
    (g) Eligible importer means any person or entity defined as an 
importer who imports, on average, over 500,000 pounds annually of fresh 
mushrooms during the representative period. Importation occurs when 
commodities originating outside the United States are entered or 
withdrawn from the U.S. Customs Service for consumption in the United 
States. Included are persons who hold title to foreign-produced 
mushrooms immediately upon release by the U.S. Customs Service, as well

a divided ownership arrangement involving totally independent entities 
cooperating only to produce mushrooms, in which more than one of the 
parties is a producer, shall be entitled to cast one ballot in the 
referendum covering only such producer's share of the ownership.
    (b) Proxy voting is not authorized, but an officer or employee of an 
eligible corporate producer or importer, or an administrator, executor, 
or trustee of an eligible producing or importing entity may cast a 
ballot on behalf of such producer or importer entity. Any individual so 
voting in a referendum shall certify that such individual is an officer 
or employee of the eligible producer or importer, or an administrator, 
executor, or trustee of an eligible producing or importing entity, and 
that such individual has the authority to take such action. Upon request 
of the referendum agent, the individual shall submit adequate evidence 
of such authority.
    (c) Ballots are to be cast by mail or fax.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.303  Instructions.

the referendum agent. Such agent shall:
    (a) Determine the time of commencement and termination of the period 
during which ballots may be cast.
    (b) Provide ballots and related material to be used in the

addresses are known to the referendum agent, the instructions on voting, 
a ballot, and a summary of the terms and conditions of the Order. No 
person who claims to

[[Page 93]]

review the ballots and tabulate the results.
    (g) Prepare a report on the referendum.
    (h) Prepare an announcement of the results for the public.

the absence of such appointment, shall be performed by the agent.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.305  Ballots.

challenged for any reason, the agent or subagent shall endorse above 
their signature, on the ballot, a statement to the effect that such 
ballot was challenged, by whom challenged, the reasons therefore, the 
results of any investigations made with respect thereto, and the

appointment to the Board, the Secretary may appoint persons on the basis 
of representation as provided in Sec. 1210.324. If the Board fails to 
adhere to procedures prescribed by the Secretary for nominating a public 
representative, the Secretary shall appoint such representative.
    (b) Membership on the Board shall be determined on the basis of two 
handler and two producer representatives for each of seven districts in 
the contiguous States of the United States. Such districts as hereby 
established have approximately equal production volume according to the 
three-year average production as set forth in the USDA Crop Production 
Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981. They are:


[[Page 96]]

    (c) After two years, the Board shall review the districts to 
determine whether realignment of the districts is necessary and at least 
every five years thereafter the Board shall make such a review. In 
making such review, it shall give consideration to:
    (1) The most recent three years USDA production reports or Board 
assessment reports if USDA production reports are unavailable;

assessments from the producer or deduct such assessments from the 
proceeds paid to the producer on whose watermelons the assessments are 
made. The handler shall maintain separate records for each producer's 
watermelons handled, including watermelons produced by said handler. In 
addition, the handler shall indicate the total quantity of watermelons 
handled by the handler, including those that are exempt under this Plan, 
and such other information as may be prescribed by the Board.

rules and regulations approved by the Secretary.
    (e) Producer-handlers and handlers shall pay assessments to the 
Board at such time and in such manner as the Board, with the Secretary's 
approval, directs, pursuant to regulations issued under this part. Such 
regulations may provide for different handlers or classes of handlers 
and different handler payment and reporting schedules to recognize 
differences in marketing practices or procedures used in any State or 
production area.
    (f) There shall be a late payment charge imposed on any handler or 
importer who fails to remit to the Board the total amount for which any 
such

[[Page 101]]

handler or importer is liable on or before the payment due date 
established by the Board under paragraph (e) of this section. The amount 
of the late payment charge shall be set by the Board subject to approval 
by the Secretary.
    (g) There shall also be imposed on any handler or importer subject

importer is liable. The rate of such interest shall be prescribed by the 
Board subject to approval by the Secretary.

of administrative expenses subject to the same fiscal, budget, and audit

assessments in its behalf with the approval of the Secretary. Any 
reimbursement by the Board for such services shall be based on 
reasonable charges for services rendered.

against improper use of such exemptions.
    (b) Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year 
shall be entitled to apply for a refund that is equal to the rate of 
assessment paid by domestic producers.
    (c) The Secretary may adjust the quantity of the weight exemption 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the recommendation of the 
Board after an opportunity for public notice and comment to reflect 
significant changes in the 5-year average yield per acre of watermelons

<R05>
Sec. 1210.403  Voting procedures.

    (a) Proxy voting by producers and handlers for producer and handler 
nominees shall be permitted at all district conventions: Provided, That 
producers may cast proxy votes for producers only, and handlers may cast 
proxy votes for handlers only. In non-multi-State districts, proxy 
voting shall be permitted for all producer and handler nominee balloting 
to determine the districts' nominees. In multi-State districts, proxy 
voting shall be permitted for all producers and handlers participating 
in a State's balloting to determine the State's nominees. No other proxy 
voting, such as for district convention chairperson, shall be allowed. 
Any person wanting to cast proxy votes must demonstrate authorization to 
do so. Authority to cast a proxy vote on behalf of another person shall 
be demonstrated through documentation containing:
    (1) The proxy voter's name, address, and telephone number;
    (2) Signature and date signed;
    (3) A certification identifying the proxy voter as a producer or a 
handler; and
    (4) A statement identifying the person being given authority by the 
proxy voter to cast the proxy vote.

All proxy documentation must be received by the Board at its 
headquarters address at least two weeks before the district convention 
is scheduled to convene. For the purpose of the initial district 
convention, all proxy documentation must be forwarded to the Department 
representative identified in the call for the district convention in a 
manner that will ensure receipt, at the address specified in the call, 
at least 72 hours before the district convention is scheduled to 
convene. The Board, or in the case of the initial conventions the 
Department representative identified in the call or other representative 
of the Department, may challenge any proxy vote and disqualify any 
challenged vote for cause. In the case of duplicate proxy authorizations 
by any

[[Page 106]]

person, only the first authorization, determined by date will be 
allowed. In the case of duplicate dates, the proxy which is received 
first will be allowed.
    (b) In non-multi-State districts, convention chairpersons shall be 
elected by a majority vote of the eligible voters in attendance. In 
multi-State districts, the election shall be by majority vote of all 
States present with each State's vote(s) determined by a majority vote 
of the eligible voters of that State in attendance. Each such State is 
entitled to one vote, plus one additional vote for each 500,000 
hundredweight volume of production in the State as determined by the 
three-year average annual crop production summary reports of the 
Department or, if such reports are not published, then the three-year 
average of the Board's assessment reports: Provided, That for the first 
two conventions, the Department's Crop Production Annual Summary Reports 
for 1979, 1980, and 1981 will be controlling as to any additional 
production volume votes.
    (c) In multi-State districts 3, 4, 5 and 7, the convention 
chairperson will direct the eligible producer voters and handler voters 
from each State to caucus separately for the purpose of electing a State 
spokesperson for each group. Election of each State spokesperson shall 
be by simple majority of all individual voters in attendance. In lieu of 
written ballots, a State spokesperson may be elected by voice vote or a 
show of hands. The role of the State spokesperson is to coordinate State 
voting and to cast all State votes.
    (d) Convention chairpersons will coordinate the entire producer and 
handler nomination process. In conducting the nomination process, each 
convention chairperson will ensure that:
    (1) Voting for producer nominees is limited to producers, and voting 
for handler nominees is limited to handlers; and
    (2) Producer candidates for nomination are producers, and handler 
candidates for nomination are handlers.
    (e) Voting, for producer and handler nominees, in non-multi-State 
districts shall be on the basis of one vote per person, except that 
persons authorized to cast proxy votes shall be allowed to cast all 
proxy votes not disallowed by the Board or the Department. Election of 
nominees shall be on the basis of a simple majority of all eligible 
votes cast.
    (f) Voting for producer and handler nominees in multi-State 
districts shall be on a State by State basis. Producers and handlers 
from each State shall caucus separately, at the district convention, for 
the purpose of determining which nominees shall receive their State's 
vote(s) for membership on the Board. Each State's vote(s) shall be based 
on a simple majority of all votes (including proxy votes) cast by 
producers or handlers voting in their State's caucus. Each State 
represented at a multi-State district convention shall have one vote for 
each producer position and one vote for each handler position from the 
district on the Board. Each State shall further have an additional vote 
toward each position for each 500,000 hundredweight volume of production 
in the State as determined by the three-year average annual crop 
production summary reports of the Department or, if such reports are not 
published, then the three-year average of the Board's assessment 
reports: Provided, That for the first two calls for nominees, the 
Department's Crop Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 
1981 will be controlling as to any additional production volume votes. 
Each State spokesperson will cast the State's vote(s) for each nominee 
position. Election of nominees shall be on the basis of a simple 
majority of all State votes cast.
    (g) During the voting for convention chairperson, State 
spokesperson, and Board member nominee, should no candidate receive the 
required simple majority on the first ballot, the number of candidates 
may be reduced by dropping one or more of the lowest vote recipients 
from the list of candidates. The balloting will be repeated until the 
position is filled.
    (h) Two nominees shall be elected for each of the producer and 
handler positions from each district on the Board. The two nominees for 
each position shall be elected simultaneously. The convention 
chairperson will open the floor to the nomination of candidates

[[Page 107]]

for possible election as a Board member nominee for each available 
position. Each position will be dealt with separately (i.e., candidates 
for one position will be nominated and then elected before the 
convention moves on to the next available position). Each eligible voter 
may vote for two of the nominees on one ballot. The two nominees 
receiving the greatest number of votes and at least a simple majority of 
the votes cast will be elected as the district's Board member nominees 
for the position. No individual elected as a nominee for Board 
membership may be a candidate on subsequent Board member nominee ballots 
(i.e., two different producer names and two different handler names must 
be submitted as nominees for each producer and handler position from 
each district to the Secretary of Agriculture). There shall be no 
designation of first and second choice nominees.

eligibility. After the names of nominees are received, the Board shall 
print ballots and ask eligible importers to vote to nominate their 
candidates. After the vote is received, the Board shall tabulate the 
results and shall send to the Department the nominees in order of 
preference. The Board shall provide the Secretary with a report on the

of imports, and shall arrange for completion of qualification

[[Page 108]]

statements and other specified information by each nominee and forward 
such to the Secretary within 14 calendar days of receiving the ballots.
    (g) Any individual who both imports and handles watermelons will be

combined total volume of watermelons handled and imported by that 
person.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.516  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1210.517  Determination of handler.

    The producer and handler assessments on each lot of watermelons 
handled shall be paid by the handler. Unless otherwise provided in this 
section, the handler responsible for payment of assessments shall be the 
first handler of such watermelons. The first handler is the person who 
initially performs a handling function as heretofore defined. Such 
person may be a fresh shipper, processor, or other person who first 
places the watermelons in the current of commerce.

[[Page 110]]

    (a) The following examples are provided to aid in the identification 
of first handlers:
    (1) Producer grades, packs, and sells watermelons of own production 
to a handler. In this instance, it is the handler, not the producer, who 
places the watermelons in the current of commerce. The handler is 
responsible for payment of the assessments.
    (2) Producer packs and sells watermelons of that producer's own 
production from the field, roadside stand, or storage to a consumer, 
trucker, retail or wholesales outlet, or other buyer who is not a 
handler of watermelons. The producer places the watermelons in the 
current of commerce and is the first handler.
    (3) Producer purchases watermelons from another producer. The 
producer purchasing the watermelons is the first handler.
    (4) Producer delivers field-run watermelons of own production to a 
handler for preparation for market and entry into the current of 
commerce. The handler, in this instance, is the first handler, 
regardless of whether the handler subsequently handles such watermelons 
for the account of the handler or for the account of the producer.
    (5) Producer delivers field-run watermelons of own production to a 
handler for preparation for market and return to the producer for sale. 
The producer in this instance, is the first handler, except when the 
producer subsequently sells such watermelons to a handler.
    (6) Producer delivers watermelons of own production to a handler who 
takes title to such watermelons. The handler who purchases such 
watermelons from the producer is the first handler.
    (7) Producer supplies watermelons to a cooperative marketing 
association which sells or markets the watermelons and makes an 
accounting to the producer, or pays the proceeds of the sale to the 
producer. In this instance, the cooperative marketing association 
becomes the first handler upon physical delivery to such cooperative.
    (8) Handler purchases watermelons from a producer's field for the 
purpose of preparing such watermelons for market or for transporting 
such watermelons to storage for subsequent handling. The handler who 
purchases such watermelons from the producer is the first handler.
    (9) Broker/Commission House receives watermelons from a producer and 
sells such watermelons in the Broker's/Commission House's name. In this 
instance, the Broker/Commission House is the first handler, regardless 
of whether the Broker/ Commission House took title to such watermelons.
    (10) Broker/Commission House, without taking title or possession of 
watermelons, sells such watermelons in the name of the producer. In this 
instance, the producer is the first handler.
    (11) Processor utilizes watermelons of own production in the 
manufacture of rind pickles, frozen, dehydrated, extracted, or canned 
products for human consumption. In so handling watermelons the processor 
is the first handler.
    (12) Processor purchases watermelons from the producer thereof. In 
this instance, the processor is the first handler even though the 
producer may have graded, packed, or otherwise handled such watermelons.
    (b) In the event of a handler's death, bankruptcy, receivership, or 
incapacity to act, the representative of the handler or the handler's 
estate shall be considered the handler of the watermelons for the 
purpose of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.518  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Time of payment. The assessment on domestically produced 
watermelons shall become due at the time the first handler handles the 
watermelons for non-exempt purposes. The assessment on imported 
watermelons shall become due at the time of entry, or withdrawal, into 
the United States.
    (b) Responsibility for payment. (1) The first handler is responsible 
for payment of both the producer's and the handler's assessment. The 
handler may collect the producer's assessment from the producer or 
deduct such producer's assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer 
on whose watermelons the producer assessment is made. Any such 
collection or deduction of producer assessment shall be made not later 
than

[[Page 111]]

the time when the first handler handles the watermelons.
    (2) The U.S. Customs Service shall collect assessments on imported 
watermelons from importers and forward such assessments under an 
agreement between the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Importers shall be responsible for payment of assessments 
directly to the Board of any assessments due but not collected by the 
U.S. Customs Service at the time of entry, or withdrawal, on watermelons 
imported into the United States for human consumption.
    (c) Payment direct to the Board. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b) and (e) of this section, each handler and importer shall remit the 
required producer and handler assessments, pursuant to Sec. 1210.341 of 
the Plan, directly to the Board not later than 30 days after the end of 
the month such assessments are due. Remittance shall be by check, draft, 
or money order payable to the National Watermelon Promotion Board, or 
NWPB, and shall be accompanied by a report, preferably on Board forms, 
pursuant to Sec. 1210.350. To avoid late payment charges, the

or computer generated reports, provided such settlement sheets or 
computer reports contain all the information listed above.
    (vii) Name, address, and hundredweight handled for each person 
claiming exemption for assessment.
    (viii) If the handler handled watermelons for persons engaged in the 
growing of less than 10 acres of watermelons, the report shall indicate

handled for such person.
    (3) The words ``final report'' shall be shown on the last report at 
the close of the handler's marketing season or at the end of each fiscal 
period if such handler markets assessable watermelons on a year-round 
basis.
    (4) Prepayment of assessments. (i) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
and reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Board 
may permit handlers to make an advance payment of their total estimated 
assessments for the crop year to the Board prior to their actual 
determination of assessable watermelons. The Board shall not be 
obligated to pay interest on any advance payment.

marketing season or at the end of each fiscal period if such handler 
markets assessable watermelons on a year-round basis.
    (iii) Handlers using such procedures shall, after filing a final 
annual report, receive a reimbursement of any overpayment of 
assessments.
    (iv) Handlers using such procedures shall, at the request of the 
Board to verify a producer's refund claim, provide the Board with a 
handling report on any and all producers for whom the handler has 
provided handling services but has not yet filed a handling report with 
the Board.
    (v) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board on request.
    (d) Late payment charges and interest. (1) A late payment charge 
shall be imposed on any handler and importer who fails to make timely 
remittance to the Board of the total producer and handler and importer 
assessments for which any such handler and importer is

[[Page 112]]

liable. Such late payment shall be imposed on any assessments not 
received before the fortieth day after the end of the month such 
assessments are due. This one-time late payment charge shall be 10 
percent of the assessments due before interest charges have accrued. The 
late payment charge will not be applied to any late payments postmarked 
within 30 days after the end of the month such assessments are due.
    (2) In addition to the late payment charge, one and one-half percent 
per month interest on the outstanding balance, including the late 
payment charge and any accrued interest, will be added to any accounts 
for which payment has not been received by the last day of the second 
month following the month of handling; Provided, that, handlers paying 
their assessments in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii), will not be 
subject to the one and one-half percent per month interest under this 
paragraph until the last day of the second month after such assessments 
are due under paragraph (c)(4)(ii). Such interest will continue monthly 
until the outstanding balance is paid to the Board.
    (e) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may enter into 
agreements, subject to approval of the Secretary, authorizing other 
organizations, such as a regional watermelon association or State 
watermelon board, to collect assessments in its behalf. In any State or 
area in which the Board has entered into such an agreement, the 
designated handler shall pay the assessment to such agency in the time 
and manner, and with such identifying information as specified in such 
agreement. Such an agreement shall not provide any cooperating agency 
with authority to collect confidential information from handlers or 
producers. To qualify, the cooperating agency must on its own accord 
have access to all information required by the Board for collection 
purposes. If the Board requires further evidence of payment than 
provided by the cooperating agency, it may acquire such evidence from 
individual handlers. All such agreements are subject to the requirements 
of the Act, Plan, and all applicable rules and regulations under the Act 
and the Plan.

    (c) Subject to this section, any amendment or addition to an 
approved budget must be approved by the Secretary, including shifting

are consistent with governing bylaws need not have prior approval by the 
Secretary.
    (d) The USACBC is authorized to incur such expenses, including 
provision for a reasonable reserve, as the Secretary finds are 
reasonable and likely to be incurred by the USACBC for its maintenance 
and functioning, and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its 
duties in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. Such expenses 
shall be paid from funds received by the USACBC.

    (g) The USACBC may also receive funds provided through the 
Department's Foreign Agricultural Service or from other sources, with 
the approval of the Secretary, for authorized activities.
    (h) The USACBC shall reimburse the Secretary for all expenses 
incurred by the Secretary in the implementation, administration, and 
supervision of the Order, including all referendum costs in connection

paragraph (h) are excluded from this limitation on spending.
    (j) The USACBC may establish an operating monetary reserve and may 
carry over to subsequent fiscal periods excess funds in any reserve so 
established: Provided that the funds in the reserve do not exceed one 
fiscal period's budget. Subject to approval by the Secretary, such 
reserve funds may be used to defray any expenses authorized under this 
part.

the Board including those collected pursuant to Sec. 1218.56 and 
subject to the limitations contained therein.
    (b) The collection of assessments on domestic blueberries will be 
the responsibility of the first handler receiving the blueberries. In 
the case of the producer acting as its own first handler, the producer 
will be required to collect and remit its individual assessments.
    (c) Such assessments shall be levied at a rate of $12 per ton on all 
blueberries. The assessment rate will be reviewed, and may be modified 
with the approval of the Secretary, after the first referendum is 
conducted as stated in Sec. 1218.71(b).
    (d) Each importer of fresh and processed blueberries shall pay an 
assessment to the USACBC on blueberries imported for marketing in the 
United States, through the U.S. Customs Service.
    (1) The assessment rate for imported fresh and processed blueberries 
shall be the same or equivalent to the rate for fresh blueberries

0810.40.0028 and 0811.90.2028, respectively, in the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States or any other numbers used to identify 
fresh and frozen blueberries. Assessments on other types of imported 
processed blueberries, such as dried blueberries, puree, and juice, may 
be added at the recommendation of the USACBC with the approval of the 
Secretary.
    (3) The assessments due on imported fresh and processed blueberries 
shall be paid when they enter or are withdrawn for consumption in the 
United States.
    (e) All assessment payments and reports will be submitted to the 
office of the USACBC. All final payments for a crop year are to be 
received no later than November 30 of that year. A late payment charge 
shall be imposed on any handler who fails to remit to the USACBC, the 
total amount for which any such handler is liable on or before the due 
date established by the USACBC. In addition to the late payment charge, 
an interest charge shall be imposed on the outstanding amount for which 
the handler is liable. The rate of interest shall be prescribed in 
regulations issued by the Secretary.
    (f) Persons failing to remit total assessments due in a timely 
manner may also be subject to actions under federal debt collection 
procedures.
    (g) The USACBC may authorize other organizations to collect 
assessments on its behalf with the approval of the Secretary.

form provided by the USACBC, for a certificate of exemption. Such 
producer shall certify that the producer's production of blueberries 
shall be less than 2,000 pounds for the fiscal year for which the

fresh and processed blueberries annually who desires to claim an 
exemption from assessments during a fiscal year as provided in Sec. 
1218.52 shall apply to the USACBC, on a form provided by the USACBC, for 
a certificate of exemption. Such importer shall certify that the 
importer's importation of fresh and processed blueberries shall not 
exceed 2,000 pounds, for the fiscal year for which the exemption is 
claimed.
    (b) On receipt of an application, the USACBC shall determine whether 
an exemption may be granted. The USACBC then will issue, if deemed 
appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person who is eligible 
to receive one. Each producer who is exempt from

[[Page 152]]

assessment must provide an exemption number to the first handler in 
order to be exempt from the collection of an assessment on blueberries. 
First handlers and importers, except as otherwise authorized by the 
USACBC, shall maintain records showing the exemptee's name and address 
along with the exemption number assigned by the USACBC.

Service. Requests for reimbursement shall be submitted to the USACBC 
within 90 days of the last day of the year the blueberries were actually 
imported.

subsequent fiscal year shall reapply to the USACBC, on a form provided 
by the USACBC, for a certificate of exemption.

assessments to provide to the USACBC reports on the disposition of 
exempt blueberries and, in the case of importers, proof of payment of 
assessments.

shall be reviewed or evaluated periodically by the USACBC to ensure that 
it contributes to an effective program of promotion, research, or 
information. If it is found by the USACBC that any such program, plan, 
or project does not contribute to an effective program of promotion, 
research, or information, then the USACBC shall terminate such program, 
plan, or project.
    (d) No program, plan, or project including advertising shall be 
false or misleading or disparaging another agricultural commodity. 
Blueberries of all origins shall be treated equally.

referendum covering only such producer's share of the ownership.
    (b) Proxy voting is not authorized, but an officer or employee of an 
eligible corporate producer or importer, or an administrator, executor, 
or trustee or an eligible entity may cast a ballot on behalf of such 
entity. Any individual so voting in a referendum shall certify that such 
individual is an officer or employee of the eligible entity, or an

individual has the authority to take such action. Upon request of the

United States and the volume of imported Hass avocados on the basis of 
the amount of assessments collected from producers and importers over

to the Secretary the reapportionment of the positions authorized in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section to reflect changes in the proportion of

soybeans shall collect an assessment from the producer, and each 
producer shall pay such assessment to the first purchaser, at the rate 
of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the net market price of the 
soybeans purchased. Each first purchaser shall remit such assessment to 
the Board or to a Qualified State Soybean Board, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (2) Any producer marketing processed soybeans or soybean products of 
that producer's own production, shall remit to a Qualified State Soybean 
Board or to the Board, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
an assessment on such soybeans or soybean products at a rate of one-half 
of one percent (0.5%) of the net market price of the soybeans involved 
or the equivalent thereof.
    (3) In determining the assessment due from each producer under 
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, a producer who is 
contributing to a Qualified State Soybean Board shall receive a credit 
from the Board for contributions to such Qualified State Soybean Board 
on any soybeans assessed under this section in an amount not to exceed 
one-quarter of one percent of the net market price of the soybeans 
assessed.
    (4) In order for a producer to receive the credit provided for in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Qualified State Soybean Board or 
the first purchaser must establish to the satisfaction of the Board that 
the producer has contributed to a Qualified State Soybean Board.
    (5)(i) If the soybeans, for which an assessment is paid, were grown 
in a State other than the State which is the situs of the first 
purchaser, the first purchaser that collects the assessment shall remit 
the assessment and information as to the State of origin of the soybeans 
to the Qualified State Soybean Board operating in the State in which the 
first purchaser is located. The Qualified State Soybean Board operating 
in the State in which the first purchaser is located shall remit such 
assessments to the Qualified State Soybean Board operating in the State 
in which the soybeans were grown. If no such Qualified State Soybean 
Board exists in such State, then the assessments shall be remitted to 
the Board. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may authorize 
Qualified State Soybean Boards to propose modifications to the foregoing 
``State of Origin'' rule to ensure effective coordination of assessment 
collections between Qualified State Soybean Boards.
    (ii)(A) If a producer pledges soybeans grown by that producer as 
collateral for a loan issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation and if 
that producer forfeits said soybeans in lieu of loan repayment, the 
Commodity Credit Corporation shall at the time of the loan settlement, 
collect from the producer the assessments due based on 0.5 percent of 
the principal loan amount received by the producer and remit the 
assessment to the Qualified State Soybean Board in the State in which 
the soybeans were pledged, or if no Qualified State Soybean Board exists 
in such State, the Board.
    (B) If a producer redeems and subsequently markets soybeans which 
have been pledged as collateral for a loan issued by the Commodity 
Credit Corporation, the first purchaser shall collect and remit the 
assessments due pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or if a 
producer markets such soybeans as processed soybeans or as soybean 
products, the producer shall remit

[[Page 187]]

the assessment pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Qualified State Soybean Boards and the Board shall coordinate 
assessment collection procedures to ensure that producers marketing 
soybeans are required to pay only one assessment per bushel of soybeans 
and collections are adjusted among States on a mutually agreeable basis.
    (b) The collection of assessments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, shall commence on and after the date assessments are required 
to be paid and shall continue until terminated by the Secretary. If the 
Board is not constituted on the date the first assessments are to be 
collected, the Secretary shall have the authority to receive the 
assessments on behalf of the Board, and to hold such assessments until 
the Board is constituted, then remit such assessments to the Board.
    (c)(1) Each person responsible for the collection of assessments 
under paragraph (a) of this section, shall collect and remit the 
assessments to the Board or a Qualified State Soybean Board on a monthly 
basis or as required by State law, but no less than quarterly, unless 
the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, has specifically 
authorized otherwise.
    (2) Any unpaid assessments due the Board or a Qualified State 
Soybean Board from a person responsible for remitting assessments to the 
Board or a Qualified State Soybean Board pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, shall be increased two percent (2%) each month beginning 
with the day following the date such assessments were due under this 
subpart. Any remaining amount due shall be increased at the same rate on 
the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid.
    (3) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on unpaid assessments and shall include any unpaid late charges 
previously applied pursuant to this section.
    (4) For the purpose of this section, any assessment that was 
determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a 
person's failure to submit a report to the Board or a Qualified State 
Soybean Board when due, shall be considered to have been payable by the 
date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due.
    (d) Prior to the continuance referendum, the Board, pursuant to 
procedures approved by the Secretary, shall ensure that each Qualified 
State Soybean Board is provided credit in accordance with the provisions 
of section 1969(n)(1) and subject to section 1969(n)(3) of the Act.
    (e) Following the continuance referendum, the Board, pursuant to 
procedures approved by the Secretary, shall ensure annually that each 
Qualified State Soybean Board is provided credit in accordance with the 
provisions of section 1969(n)(2) and subject to section 1969(n)(3) of 
the Act.

share of the proceeds.
    (c) Failure of the first purchaser to collect the assessment on each 
bushel of soybeans marketed as designated in Sec. 1220.311 shall not

announced by the Secretary.
    (1) Each eligible producer shall be required to complete form LS-51-
1 in its entirety and sign it. The producer must legibly print his/her 
name and, if applicable, the producer entity represented, address, 
county, and telephone number. The producer must read the certification 
statement on form LS-51-1 and sign it certifying that:
    (i) The person or the producer entity they represent was a producer 
of soybeans during the representative period;
    (ii) The individual requesting a referendum on behalf of a 
corporation or other entity is authorized to do so; and
    (iii) The individual has submitted only one request for a referendum 
unless they are also an authorized representative for another eligible 
corporation or other entity.
    (2) The producer, corporation, or other entity must also provide 
documentation, such as a sales receipt, showing that the producer, 
corporation, or other entity has paid an assessment on soybeans during 
the representative period.
    (3) Only a completed and signed form LS-51-1 accompanied by 
documentation showing that soybean assessments were paid during the 
representative period shall be considered a valid request for a 
referendum.
    (b) To request a referendum, eligible producers may obtain form LS-
51-1 in-person, by mail, or by facsimile during the request for 
referendum period from the county FSA office where FSA maintains and 
processes the producer's, corporation's, or other entity's 
administrative farm records. For the producer, corporation, or other 
entity not participating in FSA programs, the opportunity to request a 
referendum would be provided at the county FSA office serving the county

Eligible producers may also obtain form LS-51-1 via the Internet at 
www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/mpb/rp-soy.htm. For those persons who chose to 
obtain form LS-51-1 via the Internet, the completed form and required 
documentation must be submitted to the county FSA office where FSA 
maintains and process the producer's, corporation's, or other entity's 
administrative farm records. For producer, corporation, or other entity 
not participating in FSA programs, the opportunity to request a 
referendum would be provided at the county FSA office serving the county 
where the producer, corporation, or other entity owns or rents land.
    (c) Producers or producer entities may return form LS-51-1 and the 
accompanying documentation in-person, by mail, or facsimile to the 
appropriate county FSA office. Form LS-51-1 returned in-person or by 
facsimile, must be received in the appropriate county FSA office prior

documentation returned by mail must be postmarked no later than midnight 
of the final day of the Request for Referendum period and must be 
received in the county FSA office prior to the start of canvassing Form 
LS 51-1.
    (d) Producers who obtain form LS-51-1 in-person at the appropriate 
FSA county office may complete and return the form the same day, 
accompanied by documentation, such as a sales receipt, showing that 
soybean assessments were paid during the representative period.


<R05>
Sec. 1220.623  Canvassing requests.

    (a) Canvassing of Form LS-51-1 shall take place at the opening of 
county FSA offices on the 5th business day following the Request for 
Referendum period. Such canvassing, acting on behalf of the 
Administrator, AMS, shall be in the presence of at least two members of 
the county committee. If two or more of the counties have been combined 
and are served by one county office, the canvassing of the requests 
shall be conducted by at least one member of the county committee from 
each county served by the county office. The FSA State committee or the 
State Executive Director if authorized by the State Committee, may 
designate the County Executive Director (CED) and a county or State FSA 
office employee to canvass the requests and report the results instead 
of two members of the county committee when it is determined that the 
number of eligible voters is so limited that having two members of the 
county committee present for this function is impractical, and designate 
the CED and/or another county or State FSA office employee to canvass 
requests in any emergency situation precluding at least two members of 
the county committee from being present to carry out the functions 
required in this section.
    (b) The request for referendum should be canvassed as follows:
    (1) Number of eligible requests for a referendum. Each person who 
was a producer during the representative period and provides 
documentation to prove that they paid an assessment will be considered 
eligible to request a referendum.
    (2) Number of ineligible requests for a referendum. If FSA cannot 
determine that a producer is eligible based on the submitted 
documentation or if the producer fails to submit the required

that would have been collected in such State pursuant to the pork 
promotion program in existence in such State from July 1, 1984, to June 
30, 1985, had the porcine animals subject to assessment, been produced 
from July 1, 1984, to June 30, 1985, and been subject to the rates of 
assessment then in effect from such State to the Council and other 
national entities involved in pork promotion, research, and consumer

net assessments until after the referendum is conducted, and 25 percent

been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been 
filed when due. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based 
on the applicable postmark date or the

[[Page 211]]

date actually received by the Board, whichever is earlier.

wants to vote whether as an individual or as a representative of a 
corporation or other entity shall register during the 3-day in-person 
voting period at the county FSA office where FSA maintains and processes 
the individual producer's or corporation's or other entities' 
administrative farm records. A producer voting as an individual or as a 
representative of a corporation or other entity not participating in FSA 
programs, shall register and vote in the county FSA office serving the 
county where the individual producer or corporation or other entity owns 
hogs or pigs. An individual or an authorized representative of a 
corporation or other entity who owns hogs or pigs in more than one 
county shall register and vote in the FSA county office where the 
individual or corporation or other entity does most of their business. 
Producers shall be required to record on the In-Person Voter 
Registration List (Form LS-75) their name and address, and if 
applicable, the name and address of the corporation or other entity they 
represent before they can receive a registration form and ballot. To 
register, producers shall complete the in-person registration and 
certification form (Form LS-72-2) and certify that:
    (i) They or the corporation or other entity they represent were 
producers during the specified representative period; and
    (ii) The person voting on behalf of a corporation or other entity 
referred to in Sec. 1230.612 is authorized to do so.
    (2) Each eligible producer who has not voted by means of an absentee 
ballot may cast a ballot in-person at the location and time set forth in 
Sec. 1230.625 and on September 19, 20, 21, 2000. Eligible producers who 
record their names and addresses and, if applicable, the name and 
address of the corporation or other entity they are authorized to 
represent on the In-Person Voter Registration List (Form LS-75) will 
receive a combined registration and certification form printed on an 
envelope (Form LS-72-2) and a ballot (Form LS-72). Producers will enter 
the information requested on the combined registration and certification 
form/envelope (Form LS-72-2) as indicated above. Producers will then 
mark their ballots to indicate ``yes'' or ``no.'' Producers will place 
their completed ballots in an envelope marked ``Pork Ballot'' (Form LS-
72-1), seal and place it in the completed and signed registration form/
envelope marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-72-2), seal that envelope 
and personally place it in a box marked ``Ballot Box'' or other 
designated receptacle. Voting will be conducted on-site under the 
supervision of the county FSA County Executive Director (CED).
    (b) Absentee voting. (1) Eligible producers who are unable to vote 
in-person may request an absentee voting package consisting of a 
combined registration and absentee ballot form (Form LS-73) and two 
envelopes--one marked ``Pork Ballot'' (Form LS-72-1) and the other 
marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-73-1) by mail, telephone, facsimile, 
or by picking up one in-person from the county FSA office where FSA 
maintains and processes the producer's administrative farm records.
    (2) If a producer, whether requesting an absentee ballot as an 
individual or as an authorized representative of a corporation or other 
entity that does not participate in FSA programs, and therefore does not 
have administrative records at a county FSA office, he or she may 
request an absentee voting package by telephone, mail, facsimile, or 
pick it up in-person from the county FSA office serving the county where 
the individual or corporation or other entity owns hogs or pigs. An 
individual or authorized representative of a corporation or other 
entity, who owns hogs or pigs in more than one county can request an 
absentee ballot from the county FSA office where the producer

[[Page 219]]

or corporation or other entity does most of their business.
    (3) An absentee voting package will be mailed to producers by the 
FSA CED to the address provided by the prospective voter. Only one 
absentee registration form and absentee ballot will be provided to each 
eligible producer. The absentee ballots and registration forms may be 
requested during August 1, 2000, through September 18, 2000.
    (4) The county FSA office will enter on the Absentee Voter Request 
List (Form LS-74) the name and address of the individual or corporation 
or other entity requesting an absentee ballot and the date the forms 
were requested.
    (5) To register, eligible producers shall complete and sign the 
combined registration and certification form and absentee ballot (Form 
LS-73) and certify that:
    (i) They or the corporation or other entity they represent were 
producers during the specified representative period;

form and marking the ballot, shall remove the ballot portion of the 
combined registration and absentee ballot form (Form LS-73) and seal the 
completed ballot in a separate envelope marked ``Pork Ballot'' (Form LS-
72-1) and place the sealed ``Pork Ballot'' envelope in the mailing 
envelope marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-73-1) along with the signed 
registration form. Producers are required to print their name and 
address on the mailing envelope marked ``Pork Referendum'' (Form LS-73-
1), and mail or hand deliver it to the county FSA office from which the 
producer or corporation or other entity obtained the absentee voting 
package. Absentee ballots returned in-person must be received by close 
of business on the last day of the in-person voting period, which is 
September 21, 2000. Ballots received after that date will be counted as 
invalid ballots.
    (7) Absentee ballots returned by mail have to be postmarked with a 
date not later than the last day of the in-person voting period, which 
is September 21, 2000, and be received in the county FSA office by the 
close of business on the 5th business day after the last day of the in-
person voting period, which is September 28, 2000. Absentee ballots 
received after that date will be counted as invalid ballots. Upon 
receiving the ``Pork Referendum'' envelope (Form LS-73-1) containing the 
registration form and ballot, the county FSA CED will record the date 
the ``Pork Referendum'' envelope (Form LS-73-1) containing the absentee 
ballot was received in the FSA county office on the Absentee Voter 
Request List (Form LS-74) opposite the name of the producer voting 
absentee. The county FSA CED will place it, unopened, in a secure ballot 
box.

name and address is not recorded on the Absentee Voter Request List 
(Form LS-74), or the registration form or ballot was incomplete or 
incorrectly completed.
    (3) Spoiled ballots. Ballots will be considered spoiled if they are 
mutilated or marked in such a way that it cannot be determined whether 
the voter is voting ``yes'' or ``no.'' Spoiled ballots shall not be 
considered as approving or disapproving the Pork Checkoff Program, or as 
a ballot cast in the referendum.
    (4) Confidentiality. All ballots shall be confidential and the 
contents of the ballots not divulged except as the Secretary may direct. 
The public may witness the opening of the ballot box and the counting of 
the votes but may not interfere with the process.

Ballot Request List (Form LS-77), will be declared invalid. All ballots 
of importer voters declared invalid will be kept separate from the other

LS-77), or the registration form or ballot was incomplete or incorrectly 
completed.
    (3) Spoiled ballots. Ballots will be considered spoiled if they were

change under paragraph (c) of this section shall be the proportions 
determined during the prior review conducted under this section. In the 
case of the initial review, the base period proportions shall be the 
proportions determined by the Board for fiscal period 1996.

Sec. 1240.116  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Responsibility for payment. Unless otherwise authorized by the 
Board under the Act and Order, the first handler or producer-packer 
shall collect the assessment from the producer, or deduct such 
assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer on whose honey the 
assessment is made, and remit the assessments to the Board. The first 
handler or producer-packer shall furnish the producer with evidence of 
such payment. Any such collection or deduction of assessment shall be 
made not later than the time when the assessment becomes payable to the 
Board. Failure of the handler or producer-packer to collect or deduct 
such assessment does not relieve the handler or producer-packer of his 
or her obligation to remit the assessment to the Board. However, should 
a first handler or the Secretary fail to collect an assessment from a 
producer, the producer shall be responsible for the payment of the 
assessment to the Board. Assessments on imported honey and honey 
products shall be collected as specified in Sec. 1240.115(e); Provided, 
That importers shall be responsible for

[[Page 242]]

payment of any assessment amount not collected by the U.S. Customs 
Service at the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the 
United States.
    (b) Payment directly to the Board. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, each first handler and producer-packer shall pay 
the required assessment pursuant to Sec. 1240.41 of the Order directly 
to the Board at the address referenced in Sec. 1240.106, for each 
reporting period specified in Sec. 1240.119, on or before the 15th day 
following the end of such period. Payment shall be in the form of a 
check, draft, or money order payable to the Board and shall be 
accompanied by a report on Board forms pursuant to Sec. 1240.50.
    (c) Prepayment of assessment. (1) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
payment specified in Sec. 1240.119 of this subpart, the Board may 
permit first handlers or producer-packers to make advance payments of 
their total estimated assessments for the season to the Board prior to 
their actual determination of assessable honey.
    (2) Persons using such procedure shall provide a monthly accounting 
of actual handling and assessments.
    (3) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board upon request.
    (d) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may enter into 
agreements subject to approval of the Secretary authorizing other 
organizations to collect assessments in its behalf. All such agreements 
are subject to the requirements of the Act, Order, and all applicable 
rules and regulations under the Act and the Order.

Sec. 1250.356  Certification of organizations.

    Any organization may request the Secretary for certification of 
eligibility to participate in nominating members and alternate members 
on the Board to represent the geographic area in which the organization 
represents egg producers. Such eligibility shall be based in addition to 
other available information upon a factual report submitted by the 
organization which shall contain information deemed relevant and 
specified by the Secretary for the making of such determination, 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) Geographic territory covered by the organization's active 
membership;
    (b) Nature and size of the organization's active membership, 
proportion of total of such active membership accounted for by producers 
of commercial eggs, a chart showing the egg production by State in which 
the organization has members, and the volume of commercial eggs produced 
by the organization's active membership in such State(s);
    (c) The extent to which the commercial egg producer membership of 
such organization is represented in setting the organization's policies;
    (d) Evidence of stability and permanency of the organization;

derived;
    (f) Functions of the organization; and

and objectives of the act.

The primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an 
organization shall be whether its egg producer membership consists of a 
substantial number of egg producers who produce a substantial volume of 
the applicable geographic area's commercial eggs to reasonably warrant 
its participation in the nomination of members for the Board or to 
request the issuance of an order. The Secretary shall certify any 
organization which he finds to be eligible under this section and his 
determination as to eligibility shall be final.

<R05>
Sec. 1250.514  Levy of assessments.

    An assessment rate of 10 cents per case of commercial eggs is levied 
on each case of commercial eggs handled for the account of each

exempt from the provisions of the Act including this section.

[55 FR 6974, Feb. 28, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 64560, Dec. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1250.515  Reporting period and payment.

    (a) For the purpose of the payment of assessments, either a calendar 
month or a 4-week accounting period shall be considered the reporting 
period; however, other accounting periods may be used when approved by 
the Board on an individual basis. Each collecting handler shall register 
his reporting period with the Board. All changes in reporting periods 
shall be requested in writing and subject to approval by the Board.
    (b) Each producer shall pay the required assessment on his 
commercial eggs pursuant to Sec. 1250.514 to the collecting handler 
designated in Sec. 1250.516 on or before the date of final settlement 
between the producer and the collecting handler for the eggs received by 
the collecting handler during each reporting period.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.516  Collecting handlers and collection.

    (a) Handlers responsible for collecting the assessments shall be any 
of the following:
    (1) The first person to whom eggs are sold, consigned, or delivered 
by producers and who grades, cartons, or breaks such eggs. Such shell 
egg breaker or egg packer must collect and remit to the Board the 
assessments on all eggs handled except eggs for which there is a 
certification of exemption or eggs for which there is a statement 
indicating that an assessment has already been paid;
    (2) A person who buys or receives nest run eggs from a producer and 
who does not grade, carton, or break such eggs. Such person shall 
collect the assessment from the producer and remit to the Egg Board on 
all such eggs, except for which there is a certification of exemption or 
eggs for which there is a statement indicating that an assessment has 
already been paid;
    (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, a producer who grades, cartons, or breaks eggs of his own 
production shall be responsible for remitting the assessment to the 
Board on all eggs produced. This would include the eggs which he grades, 
cartons, or breaks as well as the nest run eggs which are graded,

[[Page 259]]

cartoned, or broken by another handler. Such a producer who remits the 
assessment on nest run eggs to the Board shall provide the handler 
specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section with a written 
statement that the assessment has already been paid on the nest run 
eggs; or
    (4) Upon approval of the Board, any person who handles eggs for a 
producer under a written contract that includes express provisions that 
said handler will remit the assessment on such eggs to the Board shall 
be the collecting handler notwithstanding the fact that the producer may 
have graded, cartoned, or otherwise processed the eggs.
    Following are some examples to aid in identification of collecting 
handlers:
    (i) Producer sells, assigns, consigns, or otherwise delivers nest 
run eggs of his own production to a shell egg packer or breaker for 
preparation for market--the shell egg packer or breaker is the 
collecting handler and is responsible for remitting to the Egg Board;
    (ii) Producer grades, cartons, breaks, or otherwise prepares for 
marketing a portion of the eggs of his own production and delivers the 
remaining portion of his nest run eggs to a shell egg packer or 
breaker--the producer is the collecting handler and shall remit the 
assessment on his total production to the Board;
    (iii) Producer sells all or a portion of his eggs in nest run form 
to a handler who is not a shell egg packer or breaker--the handler is 
responsible for collecting the assessment and remitting it to the Egg 
Board except for eggs covered by a statement indicating that an 
assessment has already been paid;
    (iv) A shell egg packer or breaker who buys or receives nest run 
eggs from a handler who is not a shell egg packer or breaker--the 
handler is the collecting handler and shall remit such assessment to the 
Board;
    (v) A shell egg packer or egg breaker buys nest run or graded eggs 
including undergrade eggs from another shell egg packer or egg breaker--
the first shell egg packer or breaker is the collecting handler and 
shall remit such assessments to the Board.
    (b) In the event of a producer's death, bankruptcy, receivership, or 
incapacity to act, the representative of the producer or his estate, or 
the person acting on behalf of creditors, shall be considered the 
producer of the eggs for the purpose of this subpart.
    (c) The collecting handler may collect the assessment directly from 
the producer or deduct the assessment from the proceeds due or paid to 
the producer on whose eggs the assessment is made.

[41 FR 22925, June 8, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 60724, Nov. 29, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1250.517  Remittance to Egg Board.

    (a) The collecting handler responsible for remittance of assessments 
to the Board is not relieved of this obligation as a result of his 
failure to collect payment of the assessment from the egg producer(s).
    (b) Each collecting handler required to remit the assessments on the 
eggs handled during each reporting period, specified in Sec. 
1250.515(a), shall remit the assessments directly to the Egg Board by 
check, draft, or money order payable to the Egg Board on or before the 
15th day after the end of said reporting period together with a report 
pursuant to Sec. 1250.529. The assessment for each reporting period 
shall be calculated on the basis of the gross volume of eggs subject to 
assessment received by the collecting handler during each reporting 
period.
    (c) Remittance through cooperating agency.
    (1) In any State or specified geographic area the Egg Board, with 
the approval of the Secretary, may designate by agreement a cooperating 
agency to collect the assessments in its behalf. Every collecting 
handler within such a State or geographic area shall remit the 
assessments for each reporting period, specified in Sec. 1250.515(a), 
to the designated cooperating agency by check, draft, or money order 
payable to said cooperating agency on or before the 15th day after the 
end of said reporting period together with a report pursuant to Sec. 
1250.529.
    (2) On or before the 20th day after the end of each reporting 
period, each designated cooperating agency shall remit to the Egg Board 
the total amount of

[[Page 260]]

all assessments received from collecting handlers for said reporting 
period together with all collecting handler reports. In addition, each 
designated cooperating agency shall submit to the Egg Board such 
information as is required by the designation agreement with the Egg 
Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.518  Receipts for payment of assessments.

    (a) Each collecting handler shall give each producer whose eggs are 
subject to assessment a receipt for the commercial eggs handled by said 
collecting handler showing payment of the assessment. This receipt may 
be on a separate receipt form or included as part of the invoice or 
settlement sheet for the eggs, but in either event shall contain the 
following information:
    (1) Name, address, and identification number of the collecting 
handler;
    (2) Name and address of the producer who paid the assessment;
    (3) Number of cases of eggs on which assessment was paid and the 
total amount of the assessment; and
    (4) Date on which assessment was paid by producer.
    (b) All eggs sold, consigned, or delivered from a collecting handler 
to another handler, excluding cartoned eggs and loose graded eggs sold 
to the bakeries, restaurants, and institutions, shall be accompanied 
with the collecting handler's written statement that the assessment on 
the lot of eggs covered by the invoice has been paid or that lot of eggs 
or portion thereof is exempt from assessment under provisions of Sec. 
1250.514.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.519  Late-payment charge.

    Any unpaid assessments due to the Board pursuant to Sec. 1250.347 
shall be increased by a late-payment charge of 1.5 percent each month 
beginning with the day following the date such assessments are 30 days 
past due. Any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid 
charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at 
the same rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until 
paid. Assessments that are not paid when due because of a person's 
failure to submit a handler report to the Board as required shall accrue 
late-payment charges from the time such assessments should have been 
remitted. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based on the 
applicable postmark date or the date payment is actually received by the 
Board, whichever is earlier.

greater than five hundred thousand (500,000) head of cattle shall be 
grouped, to the extent practicable, into geographically contiguous units 
each of which have a combined total inventory of not less than 500,000 
head of cattle and such unit(s) shall be entitled to at least one 
representative on the Board;
    (3) Importers shall be represented by a single unit, with the number 
of Board members representing such unit based upon a conversion of the 
total volume of imported cattle, beef or beef products into live animal 
equivalencies;
    (4) Each unit shall be entitled to representation by an additional 
Board member for each one million (1,000,000) head of cattle within the 
unit which exceeds the initial five hundred thousand (500,000) head of 
cattle within the unit qualifying such unit for representation.
    (f) In determining the volume of cattle within the units, the Board 
and the Secretary shall utilize the information received by the Board 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1260.201 and 1260.202 industry data and data 
published by the Department.

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1260.172  Assessments.

    (a) Domestic assessments. (1) Except as prescribed by regulations 
approved by the Secretary, each person making payment to a producer for 
cattle purchased from such producer shall be a collecting person and 
shall collect an assessment from the producer, and each producer shall 
pay such assessment to the collecting person, at the rate of one dollar 
($1) per head of cattle purchased and such collecting person shall remit 
the assessment to the Board or to a qualified State beef council 
pursuant to Sec. 1260.172(a)(5).
    (2) Any producer marketing cattle of that producer's own production 
in the form of beef or beef products to consumers, either directly or 
through retail or wholesale outlets, or for export purposes, shall remit 
to a qualified State beef council or to the Board an assessment on such 
cattle at the rate of one dollar ($1) per head of cattle or the 
equivalent thereof.
    (3) In determining the assessment due from each producer pursuant to 
Sec. 1260.172(a), a producer who is contributing to a qualified State 
beef council(s) shall receive a credit from the Board for contributions 
to such Council, but not to exceed 50 cents per head of cattle assessed.
    (4) In order for a producer described in Sec. 1260.172(a) to 
receive the credit authorized in Sec. 1260.172(a)(3), the qualified 
State beef council or the collecting person must establish to the 
satisfaction of the Board that the producer has contributed to a 
qualified State beef council.
    (5) Each person responsible for the remittance of the assessment 
pursuant to Sec. 1260.172 (a) (1) and (2) shall remit the assessment to 
the qualified State beef council in the State from which the cattle 
originated prior to sale, or if there is no qualified State beef council 
within such State, the assessment shall be remitted directly to the 
Board. However, the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may 
authorize qualified State beef councils to propose modifications to the 
foregoing ``State of origin'' rule to ensure effective coordination of 
assessment collections between qualified State beef councils. Qualified 
State beef councils and the Board shall coordinate assessment collection 
procedures to ensure that producers selling or marketing cattle in 
interstate commerce are required to pay only one assessment per 
individual sale of cattle. For the purpose of this subpart, ``State of 
origin'' rule means the State where the cattle were located at time of 
sale, or the State in which the cattle were located prior to sale if 
such cattle were transported interstate for the sole purpose of sale. 
Assessments shall be remitted not later than the 15th day of the month 
following the month in which the cattle were purchased or marketed.
    (6) If a State law or regulation promulgated pursuant to State law 
requires the payment and collection of a mandatory, nonrefundable 
assessment of more fifty (50) cents per head on the sale and purchase of 
cattle, or the equivalent thereof for beef and beef products as 
described in Sec. 1260.172 (a)(1) and (2) for use by a qualified State 
beef council to fund activities similar to those described in Sec. 
1260.169, and such State law or regulation authorizes the issuance of a 
credit of that amount of the assessment which exceeds fifty (50) cents 
to producers who waive any right to the refund of the assessment 
credited by the State due pursuant to this subpart, then any producer 
subject to such State law or regulation who pays only the amount due 
pursuant to such State law or regulation and this subpart, including any 
credits issued, shall thereby waive that producer's right to receipt 
from the Board of a refund of such assessment for that portion of such 
refund for which the producer received credit pursuant to such State law 
or regulation.
    (b) Importer assessments. (1) Importers of cattle, beef, and beef 
products into the United States shall pay an assessment to the Board 
through the U.S. Customs Service, or in such other manner as may be 
established by regulations approved by the Secretary.

[[Page 273]]

    (2) The assessment rates for imported cattle, beef, and beef 
products are as follows:

terms shall have the same meaning as the definition of such terms in 
subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.402  Assessments.

    (a) Sharing proceeds of sale. If more than one producer, feeder, or 
seedstock producer shares the proceeds received for the lamb or lamb 
products sold, each such producer, feeder, or seedstock producer is 
obligated to pay that portion of the assessments that is equivalent to 
that producer's, feeder's, or seedstock producer's proportionate share 
of the proceeds.
    (b) Market agencies. A person who is a market agency; i.e., 
commission merchant, auction market, or livestock market in the business 
of receiving lambs or lamb products for sale on commission for or on 
behalf of a producer, feeder, or seedstock producer, will be required to 
collect an assessment from the producer, feeder, or seedstock producer 
and pass the collected assessment on to the subsequent purchaser(s) 
until remitted by a first handler or exporter responsible for submitting 
assessments under this part.
    (c) Failure to collect. Failure of a person to collect the 
assessment on lambs purchased from a producer, feeder, or seedstock 
producer shall not relieve the producer, feeder, or seedstock producer 
of their obligation to pay the assessment and to remit the assessment to 
the Secretary.
    (d) Death, bankruptcy, receivership or incapacity to act. In the 
event of a producer's, feeder's, seedstock producer's, or exporter's 
death, bankruptcy, receivership or incapacity to act, the representative 
of such producer's, feeder's, seedstock producer's, or exporter's 
estate, the person acting on behalf of creditors or other person acting 
in such person's stead, shall be considered the producer, feeder, or 
seedstock producer and shall be required to pay an assessment or collect 
an assessment.
    (e) Remittance of assessments. (1) Assessments shall be remitted to 
the Lamb Promotion, Research, and Information Program, c/o the Secretary 
at USDA, 23029 Network Place, Chicago, Illinois 60673-1230, with a 
``Monthly Remittance Report'' form LS-81 not later than the 15th day of 
the following month in which lambs or lamb products were purchased for 
slaughter or export, or marketed, if a first handler markets lambs or 
lamb products directly to consumers, in order to avoid late payment 
charges.
    (2) In cases where a producer or feeder sells lambs as part of a 
custom slaughter operation, the producer or feeder shall be responsible 
for remitting the assessments pursuant to Sec. 1280.219.
    (3) Each person processing or causing to be processed lamb or lamb 
products of that person's own production and marketing such lamb or lamb 
products shall be responsible for remitting the assessments pursuant to 
Sec. 1280.217(c).
    (4) Late payment charges. Any unpaid assessments due to the Board 
pursuant to Sec. 1280.217 shall be increased 2 percent each month 
beginning with the day following the date such assessments were due. Any 
remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges previously 
made pursuant to this paragraph, shall be increased at the same rate on 
the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. Any 
assessment received at a date later than the date prescribed by this 
part, because of a persons failure to submit a timely report to the 
Secretary, shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would 
have been due if the report had been filed in a timely manner. The 
timeliness of a payment to the Secretary shall be based on the 
applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the Secretary, 
whichever is earlier.
    (5) Weekends and holidays. If the 15th day of the month falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or a federally recognized holiday then the required 
reports and assessment will be due the next business day in order to 
avoid late payment charges.
    (f) Non-producer status for certain transactions. (1) Each person 
seeking non-producer status pursuant to Sec. 1280.217 shall provide the 
person remitting the assessment a Statement of Certification of Non-
Producer Status form (LS-78).
    (2) A copy of the Statement of Certification of Non-Producer Status 
shall be forwarded by the person collecting the assessment to the 
Secretary.

    (1) Each eligible person shall be required to complete form LS-86 in 
its entirety, sign it, and provide evidence that they were engaged in 
the production, feeding, or slaughtering of lambs during the 
representative period. The person must legibly place his or her name

telephone number. The person shall sign and certify on form LS-86 that:
    (i) The person was engaged in the production, feeding, or 
slaughtering of lambs during the representative period;
    (ii) The person voting on behalf of a corporation or other entity is 
authorized to do so;
    (iii) The person has cast only one vote; and
    (iv) The volume of production listed on the ballot is true and 
accurate.
    (2) Only a completed and signed form LS-86 accompanied by supporting

feeding, or slaughter of lambs during the representative period shall be 
considered a valid vote.
    (b) To vote, eligible persons may obtain form LS-86 in-person, by

during the voting period. A completed and signed form LS-86 and 
supporting documentation, such as a sales receipt or remittance form, 
must be returned to the appropriate county FSA office where FSA 
maintains and processes the person's administrative farm records. For a 
person not participating in FSA programs, the opportunity to vote in a

feeding, or slaughtering of lambs in more than one county will vote in

[[Page 303]]

or her business. Forms obtained via the Internet will be located at

documentation may be returned in-person, by mail, or facsimile to the 
appropriate county FSA office. Form LS-86 and supporting documentation 
returned in-person or by facsimile, must be received in the appropriate

supporting documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.627  Canvassing voting ballots.

    (a) Canvassing of form LS-86 shall take place at the county FSA 
offices on the 6th business day following the final day of the voting

committee. If two or more of the counties have been combined and are 
served by one county office, the canvassing of the requests shall be 
conducted by at least one member of the county committee from each 
county served by the county office. The FSA State committee or the State 
Executive Director, if authorized by the State Committee, may designate 
the County Executive Director (CED) and a county or State FSA office 
employee to canvass the ballots and report the results instead of two 
members of the county committee when it is determined that the number of 
eligible voters is so limited that having two members of the county 
committee present for this function is impractical, and designate the 
CED and/or another county or State FSA office employee to canvass 
requests in any emergency situation precluding at least two members of 
the county committee from being present to carry out the functions 
required in this section.
    (b) Form LS-86 should be canvassed as follows:
    (1) Number of valid ballots. A person has been declared eligible by 
FSA to vote by completing form LS-86 in its entirety, signing it, voting 
volume of production, and providing supporting documentation that shows 
the person who cast the ballot during the voting period was engaged in 
the production, feeding, or slaughtering of lambs during the 
representative period. Such ballot will be considered a valid ballot.
    (2) Number of ineligible ballots. If FSA cannot determine that a 
person is eligible based on the submitted documentation or if the person 
fails to submit the required supporting documentation, the person shall 
be determined to be ineligible. FSA shall notify ineligible persons in 
writing as soon as practicable but no later than the 8th business day 
following the final day of the voting period.
    (c) Appeal. A person declared to be ineligible by FSA can appeal 
such decision and provide additional documentation to the FSA county 
office within 5 business days after the postmark date of the letter of 
notification of ineligibility. FSA will then make a final decision on 
the person's eligibility and notify the person of the decision.

to the following:
    (1) Form LS-86 is not signed or all required information has not

final day of the voting period;

ineligibility determinations, the requests shall be counted no later 
than the 14th business day following the final day of the voting period.
    (b) Ballots shall be counted as follows:

    (1)(i) With respect to land, capital, or equipment contributed by an 
individual or entity, a contribution that has a value at least equal to 
50 percent of the individual's or entity's commensurate share of:
    (A) The total value of the capital necessary to conduct the farming 
operation;
    (B) The total rental value of the land necessary to conduct the 
farming operation;
    (C) The total rental value of the equipment necessary to conduct the 
farming operation; or
    (ii) If the contribution by an individual or entity consists of any 
combination of land, capital, and equipment, such combined contribution 
must have a value at least equal to 30 percent of the individual's or 
entity's commensurate share of the total value of the farming operation;
    (2) With respect to active personal labor, an amount which is the 
smaller of:
    (i) 1,000 hours per calendar year; or
    (ii) 50 percent of the total hours that would be necessary to 
conduct a farming operation that is comparable in size to such 
individual's or entity's commensurate share in the farming operation;
    (3) With respect to active personal management, activities that are 
critical to the profitability of the farming operation, taking into 
consideration the individual's or entity's commensurate share in the 
farming operation; and
    (4) With respect to a combination of active personal labor and 
active personal management, when neither contribution individually meets 
the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this definition, a 
combination of active personal labor and active personal management 
that, when viewed together, results in a critical impact on the 
profitability of the farming operation in an amount at least equal to 
either the significant contribution of active personal labor or active 
personal management as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this 
definition.
    Substantial amount of active personal labor. Substantial amount of 
active personal labor means the provision of active personal labor in an 
amount that is the smaller of:
    (1) 1,000 hours per calendar year; or
    (2) 50 percent of the total hours that would be necessary to conduct 
a farming operation that is comparable in size to such individual's or 
entity's commensurate share in the farming operation.
    Substantial beneficial interest. A substantial beneficial interest 
in an entity is an interest of 10 percent or more. In determining 
whether such an interest equals at least 10 percent, all interests in 
the entity that are owned by an individual or entity directly or 
indirectly through such means as ownership of a corporation that owns 
the entity shall be taken into consideration. In order to ensure that 
the provisions of this part are not circumvented by an individual or 
entity, the Deputy Administrator may determine that an ownership 
interest requirement of less than 10 percent shall be applied to such 
individual or entity.
    Total value of the farming operation. The total value of the farming 
operation is the total of the costs, excluding the value of active 
personal labor and active personal management contributed by a person 
who is a member of the farming operation, needed to carry out the 
farming operation for the year for which the determination is made.

applicable program or fiscal year. Actions taken by a person after the 
status date set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, but on or before 
the harvest of the last contract commodity in the area, shall be used to 
determine whether there has been a decrease in the number of persons for 
the applicable program or fiscal year.

stockholder, or member except that a limited partnership, limited 
liability partnership, limited liability corporation, corporation, or 
other similar entity in which more than 50 percent of the interest in 
such limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited 
liability corporation, corporation, or other similar entity is owned by 
an individual (including the interest owned by the individual's spouse, 
minor children, and trusts for the benefit of such minor children) or by

be one person.
    (c) The percentage share of the interest in a limited partnership, 
limited liability partnership, limited liability company, corporation, 
or other similar entity that is owned by an individual or other entity 
shall be determined as of the status date set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section. If a partner, stockholder, or member acquires an interest

such interest shall be included in determining the total ownership 
interest of such partner, stockholder, or member.
    (d) Where there is only one class of stock or other similar unit of 
ownership, an individual's or entity's percentage share of the limited 
partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, 
corporation, or other similar entity shall be based upon the outstanding 
shares of stock or other similar unit of ownership held by the 
individual or entity and compared to the total outstanding shares of

partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, 
corporation, or other similar entity owned by an individual or entity 
shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on the basis of market 
quotations. If market quotations are lacking or are too scarce to be 
recognized, such percentage share shall be determined by the Deputy 
Administrator on the basis of all relevant factors affecting the fair 
market value of such stock or other unit of ownership, including the 
various rights and privileges that are attributed to each such class.

    (1) Because of the number of members of such entity no member is 
likely to have a substantial beneficial interest in such entity; and
    (2) Such provisions would cause undue financial hardship on such 
entity.
    (d)(1) An individual or entity that holds a substantial beneficial 
interest in more than the number of permitted entities specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section for which a contract or agreement has been 
submitted to the county committee shall notify the county committee in 
writing, in each county in which they conduct a farming operation, of 
those entities that shall be considered as permitted entities by a date 
as determined by the Deputy Administrator following the date the 
contract or agreement was submitted to the county committee.
    (2) The remaining entities in which the individual or entity holds a 
substantial beneficial interest shall be notified that such entity is 
subject to reductions in the payments earned by the remaining entity. 
Such a reduction shall be made in an amount that bears the same 
relationship to the full payment that the individual's interest in the 
entity bears to all interests in the entity. The remaining entity's 
members shall have the opportunity to adjust among themselves their 
proportionate shares of the program benefits in the designated entity or 
entities before such reductions are made.
    (e) If an individual or entity fails to make such a notification as 
specified

[[Page 323]]

in paragraph (d) of this section, all entities in which the individual 
or entity holds a substantial beneficial interest shall be subject to a 
reduction in payments in the manner specified in paragraph (d)(2).

                       Subpart E_Cash Rent Tenants


<R05>
Sec. 1400.401  Eligibility.

    (a) Any tenant that is actively engaged in farming in accordance 
with the provisions of subpart C and conducts a farming operation in 
which the tenant rents the land for cash, for a crop share guaranteed as 
to the amount of the commodity, or by any arrangement in which the 
tenant does not compensate the landlord by cash or a crop share, and 
receives benefits, with respect to such land under a program specified 
in Sec. 1400.1(a) shall be ineligible to receive any payment with 
respect to such cash-rented land unless the tenant makes a significant 
contribution to the farming operation of:
    (1) Active personal labor; or
    (2) Active personal management and equipment. If such equipment is 
leased by the tenant from:
    (i) The landlord, the lease must reflect the fair market value of 
the equipment leased; and
    (ii) The same individual or entity that is providing hired labor to 
the farming operation, the contracts for the lease of the equipment and 
for the hired labor must be two separate contracts that reflect the fair 
market value of the leased equipment and the hired labor and the tenant 
must exercise complete control over the use of a significant amount of 
the equipment during the current crop year.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R04>
                       Subpart F_ Foreign Persons


<R05>
Sec. 1400.501  Eligibility.

    (a) Any person who is not a citizen of the United States or a lawful 
alien shall be ineligible to receive payments, loans and benefits, with 
respect to any commodity produced, or land set aside from production, on 
a farm that is owned or operated by such person unless such person is an 
individual who is providing land, capital, and a substantial amount of 
active personal labor on such farm.
    (b)(1) A corporation or other entity shall be ineligible to receive 
payments, loan, and benefits if more than 10 percent of the beneficial 
ownership of the entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the 
United States or lawful aliens unless each foreign individual who is a 
stockholder or other type of member provides a substantial amount of 
active personal labor in the production of crops on a farm owned or 
operated by such an entity. However, upon the written request of the 
entity, the Deputy Administrator may make payments in an amount 
determined by the Deputy Administrator to be representative of the 
percentage interest of the entity that is owned by citizens of the 
United States and lawful aliens or foreign stockholders or other type of 
member who provide a significant contribution of active personal labor 
in the production of crops on a farm owned or operated by such entity.
    (2) In determining whether more than 10 percent of the beneficial 
ownership of an entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the 
United States or by lawful aliens, the beneficial ownership interest 
shall be the higher of the amount of such interest on:
    (i) The date the applicable program contract or agreement is 
executed by the entity; or
    (ii) Any other date prior to the final harvest date that is 
determined and announced by the Deputy Administrator to be normal in the 
area for the applicable program crop.
    (3) A corporation or other entity shall inform the county committee 
of any increase in such ownership that occurs after the applicable 
program contract or agreement is executed.
    (4) In the event of an increase in such ownership after a payment, 
loan, or benefit has been made, the entity shall refund such payment, 
loan, or benefit.
    (5) Where there is only one class of stock or other similar unit of 
ownership, an individual's or entity's percentage share of the limited 
partnership, corporation or other similar entity shall be based upon the 
outstanding shares of stock or other similar unit of

[[Page 324]]

ownership held by the individual or entity and compared to the total 
outstanding shares of stock or other similar unit of ownership. If the 
limited partnership, corporation or other similar entity has more than 
one class of stock or other unit of ownership, the percentage share of 
the limited partnership, corporation or other similar entity owned by an 
individual or entity shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on 
the basis of market quotations. If market quotations are lacking or are 
too scarce to be recognized, such percentage share shall be determined 
by the Deputy Administrator on the basis of all relevant factors 
affecting the fair market value of such stock or other unit of 
ownership, including the various rights and privileges that are 
attributed to each such class.
    (c) A citizen of the United States, lawful alien, or entity that is 
not subject to this part who is in lawful possession, through a lease or 
otherwise, of a farm owned by an individual or entity who is subject to 
this part may receive a payment, loan, and benefit without regard to 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.502  Notification.

    (a) Any entity, whether foreign or domestic, that executes a program 
contract or agreement under which a payment, loan, or benefit may be 
available must provide written notification to the county committee in 
the county where the entity conducts its farming operation if:
    (1) Any individual, group of individuals, entity, or group of 
entities holds more than a 10 percent beneficial interest in such 
entity; and
    (2) Such individual, group of individuals, entity, or group of 
entities, in accordance with Sec. 1400.501, are ineligible to receive a 
payment, loan and benefit.
    (b) Such written notification must, if known, include the name and 
social security number or taxpayer identification number of such 
individual or entity and of all individuals and entities that hold a 
beneficial interest.
    (c) The failure of the entity to provide this information will 
result in the ineligibility of the entity to receive any payment, loan, 
or benefit.


<R04>
           Subpart G_Average Adjusted Gross Income Limitation


<R05>
Sec. 1400.600  Applicability.

    (a) For the 2003 through 2007 crop years, program years, or fiscal 
years, an individual or entity is not eligible for any payment or 
benefit identified in Sec. 1400.1 as being subject to this part if the 
individual's or entity's average adjusted gross income exceeds $2.5 
million for the three tax years immediately preceding the applicable 
crop, program or fiscal year. Payments may also be reduced under the 
commensurate share rules set out in Sec. 1400.603.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the individual or 
entity may be considered to meet the requirements of this subpart if not 
less than 75 percent of the individual's or entity's average adjusted 
gross income for the three tax years immediately preceding the 
applicable crop, program or fiscal year, is derived from farming, 
ranching, or forestry operations.
    (c) In addition to payments or benefits identified under Sec. 
1400.1, this subpart applies to benefits provided to participants under 
contracts or agreements entered into for the 2003 through 2007 crop, 
program or fiscal years for the following programs:
    (1) The program authorized by part 1466 of this chapter or its 
successor regulations;
    (2) The program authorized by part 1467 of this chapter or its 
successor regulations;
    (3) The program authorized by part 636 of this chapter or its 
successor regulations;
    (4) Any other program authorized by Title XII of the 1985 Act, as 
amended, or Title II of the 2002 Act.
    (5) Any other program to which this subpart is made applicable by 
statute or regulation.
    (d) Determinations made under this subpart with regard to the 
programs described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section 
will be based on the year for which the contract or agreement is 
approved and that determination will apply for the entire term of the 
subject agreement or contract.
    (e) Vendors that receive payment for technical services or 
assistance provided in conjunction with programs

[[Page 325]]

under Title II of the 2002 Act and Title XII of the 1985 Act, but who 
are not beneficiaries of the program, are not subject to this subpart 
for services that are of the type that are also performed by the Federal 
Government in connection with such programs.
    (f) Payments to an escrow agent or other of similar capacity in 
which the recipient is maintaining temporary custody of the funds for 
eventual disbursement to an eligible program participant are not subject 
to this subpart so long as the party ultimately receiving the payment is 
eligible under this subpart.
    (g) Payments to States, counties, political subdivisions and 
agencies thereof, and Indian tribes are not subject to this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1400.601  Determination of average adjusted gross income.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, income from farming, ranching or 
forestry operations means income of an individual or entity derived 
from:
    (1) Producing crops, livestock or unfinished raw forestry products;
    (2) Selling (including the sale of easements and development rights) 
their own farm, ranch or forestry land or water rights;
    (3) Selling, but not as a dealer, equipment purchased to conduct 
farm, ranch or forestry operations when the equipment is otherwise 
subject to depreciation expense on the IRS Form 4835 or Schedule F;
    (4) Renting land used for farming, ranching or forestry operations; 
and
    (5) Payments made under any program authorized under chapters VI, 
VII or XIV of this title.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, except as otherwise provided in 
this subpart, adjusted gross income means:
    (1) For an individual filing a separate tax return, the amount 
reported as ``adjusted gross income'' on the final federal income tax 
return for the individual for the applicable tax year;
    (2) For an individual filing a joint tax return, the amount reported 
as ``adjusted gross income'' on the final federal income tax return for 
the applicable tax year unless a certified statement is provided by a 
certified public accountant or attorney specifying the manner in which 
such income would have been declared and reported if the individuals had 
filed two separate returns and that this calculation is consistent with 
the information actually supporting the filed joint return;
    (3) For a corporation, including a subchapter S corporation, the 
total reported ``taxable income'' as reported to the Internal Revenue 
Service plus the amount of the charitable contributions as reported on 
the final federal income tax return for the applicable tax year;
    (4) For a tax exempt entity, the ``unrelated business taxable 
income'' of the entity as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on 
the final federal income tax return, less any other income CCC 
determines to be from non-commercial activities;
    (5) For a limited liability company, limited partnership, limited 
liability partnership or similar type of organization, the income from 
trade or business activities plus the amount of guaranteed payments to 
the members as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on the final 
federal income tax return for the applicable tax year; and
    (6) For an estate or trust, the adjusted total income plus 
charitable deductions as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on the 
final federal income tax return for the applicable tax year, or the 
amount of net increase in the estate's or trust's value resulting from 
its business or investment interests.
    (c) For purposes of applying this subpart and calculating the three-
year average referenced in Sec. 1400.600, that average shall be for the 
adjusted gross income for the three tax years immediately preceding the 
applicable crop, program or fiscal year, as determined by CCC. For an 
entity that is not required to file a federal income tax return, or an 
individual or entity that did not have taxable income in one or more tax 
years, the average shall be the adjusted gross income, including losses, 
averaged for the three tax years immediately preceding the applicable 
crop, program or fiscal year, as determined by CCC. However, a new 
entity will have its adjusted gross income averaged only for those years 
of the

[[Page 326]]

base period for which it was in business, but a new entity shall not be 
considered ``new'' to the extent it takes over a existing operation and 
has any elements of common ownership or interests with the preceding 
entity, or with individuals or entities with an interest in the ``old'' 
entity. When there is such commonality, income of the ``old'' entity 
will be averaged with that of the ``new'' entity for the base period.

[68 FR 33346, June 4, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1400.602  Compliance.

    (a) To comply with the average adjusted gross income limitation, an 
individual or entity, including all interest holders in an entity, 
general partnership or joint venture, shall provide the following as 
required by CCC:
    (1) A certification in the manner prescribed by CCC from a certified 
public accountant or attorney that the average adjusted gross income of 
the individual or entity does not exceed this limitation;
    (2) A certification in the manner prescribed by CCC from the 
individual or entity that the average adjusted gross income of the 
individual or entity does not exceed this limitation; or
    (3) Submission to CCC of the relevant Internal Revenue Service 
documents and supporting financial data as requested by CCC. Supporting 
financial data may include State income tax returns, financial 
statements, balance sheets, reports prepared for or provided to another 
Government agency, information prepared for a private lender, and other 
credible information relating to the amount and source of the 
individual's or entity's income.
    (b) Audits of certifications of average adjusted gross income may be 
conducted as necessary to determine compliance with the requirements of 
this subpart. As a part of this audit income tax returns may be 
requested and if requested must be supplied. Relevant income tax returns 
and documentation must be retained a minimum of two years after the end 
of the calendar year corresponding to the year for which payments or 
benefits are requested. If an individual or entity has submitted 
information to CCC, including a certification from a certified public 
accountant or attorney, that relied upon information from a form 
previously filed with the Internal Revenue Service, such individual or 
entity shall provide to CCC a copy of any amended form filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of the filing.
    (c) The individual or entity shall provide all information and 
documentation the reviewing authority determines necessary to verify any 
information or certification provided under this subpart, including all 
documents referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Failure to 
provide necessary and accurate information to verify compliance, or 
failure to comply with this subpart's requirements, will result in 
ineligibility for all program benefits subject to this subpart for the 
year or years subject to the request.
    (d) All information provided to CCC for the purposes of determining 
compliance with this subpart will remain confidential and not be subject 
to any request submitted under the Freedom of Information Act.

<R05>
Sec. 1400.603  Commensurate reduction.

    (a) Any program payment or benefit subject to this subpart provided 
to an entity, general partnership or joint venture shall be reduced by 
an amount commensurate with the direct and indirect ownership interest 
in the entity, general partnership, or joint venture of each individual 
or entity determined to have an average adjusted gross income in excess 
of the limitation under the standards provided elsewhere in this subpart 
for the direct recipient of such payments.
    (b) Ownership interest in an entity shall be reviewed to the fifth 
level of ownership to determine whether a commensurate reduction is 
applicable and the extent of such reduction. If an ownership interest is 
not held by an individual in the fifth level of ownership in an entity, 
no payment or benefit shall be made with respect to such interest.

<R05>
Sec. 1401.1  Applicability.

    This part shall be applicable to payments and loans made in 
accordance with the programs administered by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) or the Farm Service Agency (FSA) as determined and 
announced by the Secretary of Agriculture or a designee of the 
Secretary. The definitions of the terms applicable to 7 CFR part 713 set 
forth at Sec. 713.3 also shall be applicable to this part, except that 
the term ``commodity'' shall mean any agricultural commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.2  Payments in lieu of cash payments.

    (a) CCC will, in accordance with applicable program provisions, make 
payments in a form other than in cash to persons who otherwise are 
eligible to receive a cash payment from CCC. Further, subject only to 
statutory prohibition and notwithstanding any provisions of the contract 
to participate in a program administered by CCC or FSA, CCC may: at its 
option, make payments in a form other than in cash.
    (b) As determined by CCC, payments in a form other than in cash may 
be made in the following manner:
    (1) By delivery of a commodity to a person at a warehouse or other 
similar facility;
    (2) By transfer of negotiable warehouse receipts;
    (3) By the issuance of certificates which CCC shall redeem in 
accordance with this part;
    (4) By the acquisition and use of commodities pledged as collateral 
for CCC price support loans;
    (5) By the use of commodities owned by CCC; and
    (6) By such other methods as CCC determines appropriate, including 
methods to enable the producer to receive payments in order to assure 
that the producer receives the same total return as if the payments had 
been made in cash.
    (c) The value of the payments made in any manner set forth in 
paragraph (b) shall be determined by CCC.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, CCC may, with 
respect to producers who are members of a cooperative marketing 
association which has been determined in accordance with part 1425 of 
this title to be eligible to receive price support on behalf of its 
producer-members, enter into agreements with such producers and such 
cooperatives to facilitate the making of payments to such producers. 
Such agreements may include a provision which allows a producer to make 
available for the use of the cooperative the value of the non-cash 
payment which would otherwise be made to the producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.3  Payments to persons with outstanding CCC loans.

    (a) Persons with outstanding CCC loans who are eligible to receive 
payments from CCC, including a person authorized to receive a payment on 
behalf of another person, may be required to liquidate such loans in 
accordance with this section in order to be eligible to receive a 
payment authorized by Sec. 1470.2.
    (b) A person with an outstanding CCC loan must, unless otherwise 
agreed upon by the person and CCC, redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of 
the commodity pledged as collateral for a CCC loan, as determined by 
CCC, in an amount equal in value to the value of the payment which would 
otherwise be made to such person. If the person has more than one 
outstanding CCC loan, CCC may, by contract or otherwise, prescribe which 
loan collateral the person shall be required to redeem in order to 
receive payment. The purchase

[[Page 328]]

price shall be equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the portion 
of the loan for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC is 
pledged as collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer 
storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not 
include the amount of any unearned advance storage payments received 
with respect to the redeemed collateral. After redemption and the 
subsequent sale to CCC of the commodity pledged as collateral for such 
CCC loan, CCC shall make available to the person a like quantity of the 
commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.4  Commodity certificates.

    (a) General. CCC may issue commodity certificates as a form of 
payment. Commodity certificates will bear a dollar denomination. Such 
certificate may be transferred, exchanged for the inventory of CCC 
(including the receipt in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section 
of loan collateral by a person to whom a loan secured by such collateral 
is made): or exchanged for cash, as provided for in this section. 
Commodity certificates shall be subject to the provisions of this part, 
and to any terms, conditions and restrictions provided on the 
certificate, which are incorporated by reference herein.
    (b) Liens, encumbrances, and State law. (1) The provisions of this 
section or the commodity certificates shall take precedence over any 
state statutory or regulatory provisions which are inconsistent with the 
provisions of this section or with the provisions of the commodity 
certificates.
    (2) Commodity certificates shall not be subject to any lien, 
encumbrance, or other claim or security interest, except that of an 
agency of the United States Government arising specifically under 
Federal statute.
    (3) The provisions of this paragraph (b) shall apply without regard 
to the identity of the holder of the certificate.
    (c) Transferability. Any person may transfer a commodity certificate 
to any other person. However, any such transfer must be in the full 
amount of the certificate, and can be effected only by restrictive 
endorsement on the back of the certificate, showing the name of the 
transferee and the date of the transfer, and signed by the transferor. 
CCC will not honor any certificate bearing any endorsement to ``bearer'' 
or any other nonrestrictive endorsement, or otherwise transferred in a 
manner contrary to the regulations contained in this section. The person 
who submits a commodity certificate to CCC shall endorse the certificate 
to CCC.
    (d) Exchange of commodity certificate for CCC-owned commodities--(1) 
General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity 
certificate may exchange such certificate, by itself or together with 
other commodity certificates, for such commodities as are made available 
by CCC by endorsing and submitting the certificate to CCC. If a person 
submits commodity certificates for exchange in order that the person 
would be eligible to receive a quantity of a commodity which includes 
less than an entire unit in which the commodity is stored (e.g., less 
than an entire bale of cotton or an entire barrel of honey): (i) Such 
person may forfeit the partial unit of the commodity to CCC, or (ii) CCC 
may issue a check to such person for the partial unit of the commodity 
or permit such person to purchase the remainder of such unit at a price 
determined by CCC. A person may obtain information regarding commodities 
available for exchange and the procedure for exchange from Kansas City 
Commodity Office, FSA-USDA, Kansas City, MO 64141-0205.
    (2) Minimum quantities. A holder of an amount of commodity 
certificates sufficient to acquire a carload lot, or other quantity as 
may be determined by CCC, may present such amount for exchange at any 
time on or before the expiration date of such certificates. A holder who 
is permitted to exchange the certificate for CCC-owned commodities but 
who does not possess commodity certificates in the amount specified in 
the preceding sentence may, not to exceed once during a calendar month, 
submit such certificates to CCC. CCC will, at CCC's option, pay such 
holder by check in the amount of the certificate or transfer to such 
holder title to commodities owned by CCC.

[[Page 329]]

    (3) CCC-owned commodities stored by a person who submits commodity 
certificates to CCC. CCC may require or permit holders of commodity 
certificates to exchange such certificates for commodities owned by CCC 
which are stored by such holder, without making such commodities or 
kinds of commodities available to other holders of commodity 
certificates.
    (4) Valuation. Except as otherwise may be announced by CCC, CCC will 
determine the value of CCC-owned commodities made available to holders 
of commodity certificates.
    (5) Transfer of title. Title to commodities owned by CCC which are 
transferred to a person who submits commodity certificates to CCC shall 
be transferred in store, except as may be determined and announced by 
CCC. The person who submits certificates to CCC shall be responsible for 
all costs incurred in transferring title to the commodity, except as 
specifically provided by CCC. The transfer of title to such commodities 
shall occur without regard to any State law or any claim of lien against 
the commodity or proceeds thereof which may be asserted by any creditor 
except agencies of the U.S. Government whose lien arises specifically 
under Federal statute.
    (6) Expiration date. CCC may, at its option, discount or refuse to 
accept any commodity certificate presented for exchange after the 
expiration date stated on the certificate.
    (e) Use of commodity certificates to receive loan collateral--(1) 
General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity 
certificate may use such certificate to receive commodities pledged as 
collateral for CCC loans made to such person, at any time on or before 
the expiration date stated on the certificate. A holder of a commodity 
certificate who wishes to receive a quantity of a commodity pledged by 
such person as collateral for a CCC loan in exchange for a certificate 
shall redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of the commodity equal in value 
to the dollar denomination of the certificate, as determined by CCC. The 
purchase price shall be equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the 
portion of the loan for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC 
is pledged as collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer 
storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not 
include the amount of any unearned advanced storage payments received 
with respect to the redeemed loan collateral. Upon submission of the 
certificate, which is endorsed to CCC, to the county FSA office which 
issued the loan, the holder of a commodity certificate will receive the 
quantity of the commodity which has been sold to CCC. Except as 
otherwise determined by CCC, if the holder of such certificate does not 
have commodities pledged as collateral for CCC loans equal in value to 
the dollar denomination of the certificate, as determined by CCC, CCC 
will, at CCC's option and after the producer has submitted the 
certificate, pay the difference to the person by check or in the form of 
a new commodity certificate.
    (2) Ineligible commodities. No person may use a commodity 
certificate to receive a quantity of tobacco, peanuts, or extra long 
staple cotton pledged as collateral for a CCC loan. No person may, 
before August 1, 1986, use a commodity certificate to receive a quantity 
of upland cotton pledged as collateral for a CCC loan.
    (f) Cash redemption start date. (1) The person to whom a generic 
certificate is issued which has a date entered in block D may submit 
such certificate, endorsed to CCC, at the issuing county FSA office for 
payment by check in the amount of the certificate on or after the date 
entered in block D through the expiration date of the certificate. Such 
person may not exchange the certificate for commodities owned by CCC, 
except as otherwise agreed upon between such person and CCC.
    (2) The person to whom a generic certificate is issued which has an 
entry of ``S/H'' in block D may exchange such certificate for 
commodities owned by CCC.
    (3) The person to whom a commodity specific certificate is issued 
which has a date entered in block D may submit such certificate, 
endorsed to CCC, to the Kansas City Commodity Office for the specific 
commodity entered in block C beginning on the date entered

[[Page 330]]

in block D through the expiration date of the certificate. Such 
certificate may not be exchanged for cash, except as otherwise agreed on 
by CCC.
    (4) All other certificates may be transferred and exchanged as 
determined and announced by CCC.
    (g) ``Generic'' and commodity-specific commodity certificates--(1) 
General. If a commodity certificate indicates that it is a ``generic'' 
certificate, such certificate may, subject to the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, be exchanged for any 
commodity made available by CCC or, as appropriate, used to receive a 
quantity of any commodity which serves as collateral for a CCC loan. If 
a certificate is not a ``generic certificate'', such certificate may be

    Except as CCC may provide in accordance with Sec. 1403.6, CCC shall 
collect debts owed to the Government, including applicable interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, in full, whenever feasible whether 
the debt is being collected by administrative offset or by another

payments shall:
    (1) Bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the 
debtor's ability to pay; and

debt in not more than three years.
    (b) Except as otherwise determined by CCC, no installment 
arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a certified 
financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, 
income, and expenses. The financial statement shall not be required to 
be submitted sooner than 15 business days following its request by CCC.
    (c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and may 
require the payment of interest at the late payment interest rate in 
effect on the date such agreement is executed. The installment agreement 
shall specify all the terms of the arrangement and include provision for 
accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. A confession of 
judgment provision may be included in the agreement.
    (d) CCC may deem a repayment plan to be abrogated if the debtor 
fails to comply with its terms.
    (e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information 
discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered, the debtor 
may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by 
executing a security agreement and financing agreement which provides 
CCC a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full.
    (f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to CCC, CCC may allow the 
debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary installment payment 
is to be applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a 
voluntary installment or partial payment, the payment will be applied to 
such debts as determined by CCC.

and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make

amounts owing by CCC to the carrier which are subject to a defense of 
limitation.
    (g) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of 
a contract or a violation of CCC program requirements, and offset is 
considered necessary by CCC to protect the financial interests of the 
Government.

for invoicing at the time of shipment with delivery to be made at 
designated destination points when:

of delivery, and
    (2) CCC thereafter determines that the Contractor is indebted to CCC 
because of losses sustained from shortage, damage to or deterioration of

under any other contract with CCC providing the Contractor has not 
assigned the proceeds of such contract in accordance with part 1404 of 
this chapter.
    (i) CCC may effect administrative offset against a payment to be 
made to a

ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of those procedures.
    (j)(1) Debts due any agency other than CCC shall be offset against 
amounts payable by CCC to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government

    (iii) State the name, address (including county), and, where legally

debtor and a brief description of the basis of the debt, including 
identification of the judgment, if any.
    (iv) State the amount of the debt separately as to principal, 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest, if any, shall 
be computed on a daily basis to a date shown in the request. The amount 
to be offset shall not exceed the principal sum owed by the debtor, plus 
interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment 
interest, penalties and administrative costs that have been assessed;
    (v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the 
debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order of the bankruptcy 
court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and
    (vi) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact 
person within the agency and the address to which payment should be 
sent.
    (2) Unless prohibited by law, the head of an agency, or a designee, 
may defer or subordinate in whole or in part the right of the agency to 
recover through offset all or part of any indebtedness to such agency, 
or may withdraw a request for offset. Notice of such action must be sent 
to the appropriate FSA office.
    (k)(1) After CCC has complied with the provisions of this part, CCC 
may request other agencies of the Government to offset amounts payable 
by them to persons indebted to CCC.
    (2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the 
provisions at Sec. 1403.18 shall apply.
    (l)(1) Debts shall be collected by offset in the following order of 
priority without regard to the date of the request for such collection:
    (i) Debts to CCC.
    (ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by CCC.
    (iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by CCC.
    (2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, CCC 
may, at its discretion, deviate from the usual order of priority in 
applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered 
to be in the Government's best interest. Such decision shall be made by 
CCC based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
    (m)(1) No amounts payable to a debtor by CCC shall be paid to an 
assignee until there have been collected any amounts owed by the debtor 
except as provided in this subsection.
    (2) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
Chapter by execution of Form CCC-36 shall be subject to offset for any 
debt owed to CCC or FSA without regard to the date notice of assignment 
was accepted by CCC or FSA.
    (3) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
Chapter by execution of Form CCC-252 shall be offset:
    (i) Against any debt of the assignor entered on the debt record of 
the applicable FSA office prior to the filing of such form with CCC or 
FSA, or
    (ii) At anytime, regardless of the date of filing of such form with 
CCC or FSA, if the debt which is the basis for the offset arises under 
the same contract under which the payment is earned by the assignor.

[[Page 338]]

    (4) With respect to all other Federal agencies, offset shall be made 
of any amounts due any other Federal agency which are entered on the 
debt record of the appropriate FSA office prior to the date the notice 
of assignment was accepted by CCC or FSA.
    (5) Any amount due and payable to the assignor which remains after 
deduction of amounts paid to the assignee shall be available for offset.
    (n) Amounts recovered by offset for CCC and FSA debts but later 
found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.
    (o) The debtor shall be notified whenever any offset action has been 
taken.
    (p) Offsets made pursuant to this section shall not deprive a debtor 
of any right he might otherwise have to contest the debt involved in the 
offset action either by administrative appeal or by legal action.
    (q) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be 
taken:
    (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity 
which the debtor participates in, either directly or indirectly, as 
determined by CCC.
    (2) When CCC determines that the debtor has established an entity, 
or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other 
manner, their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the 
claim or debt.
    (r) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated 
amount of the debt, including interest, administrative charges, and 
penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger 
specified amount be offset.
    (s) Offset action will not be taken against payments when:
    (1) The payment represents loan or purchase proceeds for a commodity 
which is subject to the rights of the holder of a prior valid 
enforceable lien. However, any amount that exceeds the amount of the 
prior lien shall be available for offset.
    (2) A debt has been discharged as provided in Sec. 1403.15.
    (3) The amount payable to the debtor is used to satisfy a prior lien 
on property pledged as collateral for a CCC loan or sold to CCC. 
However, any amount exceeding the amount of the prior lien shall be 
available for offset.
    (4) CCC determines such action will unduly interfere with the 
administration of a CCC or FSA program.
    (5) The debt has been delinquent for more than ten years or legal 
action to enforce the debt due CCC is barred by an applicable period of 
limitation, whichever is later.
    (t)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 1403.4, with respect to debts which are based upon an 
unsettled CCC loan, offset action may be taken when the debtor has been:
    (i) Provided written notification of the maturity date of the loan 
and the debtor has not repaid the loan by the maturity date or, in the 
case of a nonrecourse price support loan, has not repaid the loan or 
forfeited the loan collateral to CCC by the date specified by CCC;
    (ii) Notified of CCC's intent to establish an account on a debt 
record 30 days after the maturity date, or other applicable period of 
time, if the loan is not settled in accordance with the loan agreement;
    (iii) Notified of the right to pursue an administrative appeal in 
accordance with part 780 of this title if such an opportunity has not 
been previously provided;
    (iv) Provided an opportunity to inspect and copy CCC records related 
to the debt; and
    (v) Notified in writing that the debt may be collected by 
administrative offset if the loan is not repaid or, with respect to 
nonrecourse loans only, settled through forfeiture of the loan 
collateral.
    (2) After a claim has been established by CCC with respect to a loan 
which has not been settled by the date specified in the loan agreement:
    (i) In the event CCC takes possession of the collateral which is 
security for a nonrecourse of recourse loan made in accordance with 
parts 1421, 1427, 1434, or 1435 of this chapter, the value of such loan 
collateral shall be determined by CCC in accordance with the provisions 
of such parts which are used to determine the settlement value of the 
collateral. The value of such collateral shall be applied to the claim. 
Any amount remaining due on the claim must be paid by the debtor.

[[Page 339]]

    (ii) In the event CCC takes possession of the collateral which is 
the security for any other loan, the value of such collateral, as 
determined by CCC, less any costs incurred by CCC in taking possession 
and disposing of the collateral, shall be applied to the claim. Any 
amount remaining due on the claim must be paid by the debtor.

Sec. 1403.8  Withholding.

    (a) Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an 
applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable to a debtor 
by CCC to ensure that the interests of CCC and the United States will be 
protected as provided in this section.
    (b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of CCC or the 
United States only if CCC determines that:
    (1) There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of 
program requirements and the withholding action is considered necessary 
to protect the financial interests of CCC;
    (2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil 
frauds statutes and criminal prosecution or civil frauds action is of 
primary importance to program operations of CCC;
    (3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will 
be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor are not withheld;
    (4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a 
judgment on the claim of CCC;
    (5) The facts available to CCC are insufficient to determine the 
amount to be offset or the proper payee;
    (6) A judgment on a claim of CCC has been obtained; or
    (7) Such action has been requested by the Department of Justice.
    (c) Except for debts due CCC or FSA, withholding action by CCC on 
amounts payable to debtors of other Government agencies may not be made 
unless requested by the Department of Justice.

Sec. 1403.9  Late payment interest and administrative charges.

    (a)(1) The provisions of this section are applicable to all persons 
whose debt to CCC becomes delinquent after January 1, 1990, unless the 
debtor and CCC agree otherwise.
    (2) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not 
apply:
    (i) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local 
governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall be charged in 
accordance with applicable statutes or, if none are applicable, at the 
rate of interest charged by the U.S. Treasury for funds borrowed by CCC 
on the day the debt became delinquent;
    (ii) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement or contract 
either prohibits the charging of such interest or specifies the interest 
or charges applicable to the debt involved;
    (iii) If the late payment interest is waived by CCC.
    (b) CCC will assess late payment interest on the full amount of 
delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term ``full amount 
of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued regular 
loan interest or accrued program interest, and any other charges which 
are otherwise due and owing to CCC on the delinquent debt at the time 
the late payment interest is assessed, except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
    (c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate 
of interest which CCC charges on delinquent debts. The late payment 
interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's 
current value of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the 
Prompt Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
    (d)(1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract or 
other agreement with specific provisions for late payment interest and 
payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of 
the debt from the first day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise 
provided by statute.

[[Page 340]]

    (2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, 
contract or agreement containing specific provisions for late payment 
interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which notice of the debt is first mailed or 
hand-delivered to the debtor, except that, with respect to debts 
resulting from price support loans, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which a claim is established.
    (3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be 
fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except when a debtor has 
defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new 
agreement. CCC may then set a new rate of interest which reflects the 
late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is 
executed. All charges which accrued, but which were not collected under 
the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid 
under a new repayment agreement.
    (4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a 
daily basis.
    (e)(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (e)(2) of this 
section, an additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will 
be assessed on any portion of a debt which remains unpaid 90 days after 
the date described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, if no 
repayment schedule satisfactory to CCC has been agreed upon. Such rate 
will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began 
to accrue and apply on a daily basis. Such rate shall continue to accrue 
until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (2) With respect to debts resulting from price support loans, an 
additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will be assessed 
on a portion of a debt which remains unpaid 60 days after the date on 
which a claim was established. Such rate will be assessed retroactively 
from the date of claim establishment and apply on a daily basis. Such 
rate shall continue to accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (f) CCC shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs 
of processing delinquent debts against the debtor, to the extent such 
costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are 
not limited to, costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of 
employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing 
contractors for collection services, costs of selling collateral or 
property to satisfy the debt.
    (g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments 
will be applied first to administrative charges, second to additional 
interest assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and 
late payment interest, and third to outstanding principal.

<R05>
Sec. 1403.10  Waiver of late payment interest, additional interest and 
administrative charges.

    (a) Except for debts resulting from price support loans, CCC shall 
waive the collection of late payment interest and administrative charges 
on a debt or any portion of a debt which is paid within 30 days after 
the date on which late payment interest began to accrue.
    (b) CCC may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion 
of the additional interest on debts which are appealed in accordance 
with 7 CFR part 780, or other applicable appeal procedures, from either 
the date of the appeal or the date of delinquency, as determined by CCC, 
until the date a final administrative determination is issued. However, 
with respect to CCC programs administered by the Foreign Agricultural 
Service, CCC shall waive the assessment and collection of additional 
interest on debts which are appealed in accordance with 7 CFR part 780, 
or other applicable appeal procedures, from the date of delinquency 
until 30 days after the date of the letter informing the appellant of 
the final administrative determination. The waiver provisions of the 
paragraph shall not apply during any period of delay due to:
    (1) The appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled 
hearing;
    (2) The appellant's request for an additional time following the 
hearing to

[[Page 341]]

present additional information or a written closing statement; or
    (3) The appellant's failure to timely present information to the 
reviewing authority.
    (c) Assessment and collection of late payment interest, additional 
interest and administrative charges under this part may be waived by CCC 
in full, or in part, if it is determined that such action is in the best 
interest of CCC.

procedure, a debtor may obtain an administrative review under part 780 
of this title, or other applicable appeal procedures, of CCC's

    When a debtor is employed by the Federal Government or is a member 
of the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by 
offset cannot be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, CCC may 
contact the employing agency to arrange for payment of the debt by 
allotment or otherwise, in accordance with section 206 of Executive 
Order No. 11222, May 8, 1965, 30 FR 6469.

provided under another statute or regulation before:
    (a) Effecting administrative offset;
    (b) Referring the debt to private collection or credit reporting

    (a) The provisions of this section set forth the policies and 
procedures for collection of 1988 and 1989 advance deficiency 
overpayments (``overpayments'').
    (b) The following definition shall be applicable to this section:
    Financial hardship means that condition of a producer in which 
payment of the debt by lump sum would jeopardize the producer's ability 
to provide food, shelter, and medical care to his immediate family, or 
to continue the producer's farming operation, as determined by CCC.
    (c) This section applies to collection of overpayments from those 
producers who are suffering financial hardship, as determined by CCC, 
and who also meet the following conditions, as determined by CCC:
    (1) Who received an advance deficiency payment for the 1988 or 1989 
crop of a commodity under part 1413 of this chapter;
    (2) Who are required to provide a refund of at least $1,500 of such 
payment, as a result of the increase in market prices of the commodity;
    (3) Who reside in a county, or in a county that is contiguous to a 
county where CCC has determined that farming, ranching, or aquaculture 
operations have been substantially affected

[[Page 344]]

as evidenced by a reduction in normal production for the county of at 
least 30 percent during two of the three crop years 1988, 1989, and 1990 
by:
    (i) A natural disaster designated by the Secretary of Agriculture;
    (ii) A major disaster or emergency designated by the President under 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
5121 et seq.);
    (4) Where the total quantity of the 1988 or 1989 crop of the 
commodity that the producers were able to harvest is less than the 
result of multiplying 65 percent of the farm payment yield established 
CCC for the crop by the sum of the acreage planted for the harvest and 
the acreage prevented from being planted (because of the disaster or 
emergency referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) for the crop; 
and
    (5) Who have applied to the County Farm Service Agency Office which 
issued the advance deficiency payment, no later than May 31, 1991, for a 
determination of eligibility for the repayment provisions of this 
section.
    (d) CCC shall assess interest on delinquent debts for 1988 or 1989 
overpayments as follows:
    (1) CCC shall establish a regional annual interest rate for each of 
12 geographic regions, corresponding to the extent practicable, as 
determined by CCC, with the 12 geographic districts of the Farm Credit 
System.
    (2) Each regional annual interest rate shall not exceed the average 
of the interest rates charged by Farm Credit System institutions within 
the region to high-risk borrowers on 1-year operating loans, as 
determined by CCC based upon information provided to CCC by the Farm 
Credit System.
    (3) Interest shall accrue at the established regional annual 
interest rate for the region in which the debt arose, beginning November

Forms CCC-36, CCC-251 or CCC-252, FSA or CCC shall give notice thereof 
to the assignor and the assignee. If, after investigation and

Sec. 1405.6  Crop insurance requirement.

    (a) To be eligible for any benefits or payments under 7 CFR part 
1410 the producer must obtain at least the catastrophic level of 
insurance for each crop of economic significance in which the producer 
has an interest or provide a written waiver to the Secretary that waives 
any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with 
the crop, if insurance is available in the county for the crop. In 
meeting this requirement, the producer may:
    (1) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance in all 
counties for each crop of economic significance in which the producer 
has an interest;
    (2) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance for 
some, but

[[Page 347]]

not all, crops of economic significance for which the producer has an 
interest, and sign a waiver; or
    (3) Sign a waiver that waives any eligibility for crop loss 
assistance in connection with the producer's crop.
    (b) Crop of economic significance. The term ``crop of economic 
significance'' means a crop that has contributed in the previous year, 
or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, 10 percent or 
more of the total expected value of all crops grown by the producer. 
However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the total expected 
liability under the catastrophic risk protection endorsement is equal to 
or less than the administrative fee required for the crop, such crop 
will not be considered a crop of economic significance.

    In the event the outlays by the United States for domestic support 
measures will exceed, in any required reporting period, the allowable 
levels under the Uruguay Round Agreements (as defined in section 2 of 
the Uruguay Round Agreements Act), CCC will, as determined by the 
Secretary of Agriculture, reduce the amount of payments and benefits to 
be made in any such reporting period, and/or collect a refund of 
payments or benefits previously made with respect to such reporting 
period, under parts 1412, 1413, 1421, 1427, 1430, 1434 and 1435 of this 
chapter in order to ensure that the level of domestic support provided 
by the United States complies with the commitments of the United States 
in the Uruguay Round Agreements.

<R05>
Sec. 1405.8  Disqualification due to Federal crop insurance fraud.

    (a) Section 515(h) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (FCIA) provides 
that a person who willfully and intentionally provides any false or 
inaccurate information to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) 
or to an approved insurance provider with respect to a policy or plan of 
FCIC insurance after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the 
record, will be subject to one or more of the sanctions described in 
section 515(h)(3). In section 515(h)(3), the FCIA specifies that in the 
case of a violation committed by a producer, the producer may be 
disqualified for a period of up to 5 years from receiving any monetary 
or non-monetary benefit under a number of programs. The list includes, 
but is not limited to, benefits under:
    (1) Title V of the FCIA.
    (2) The Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.), 
including the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program under section

    (3) The Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.).

seq.).
    (7) Any law that provides assistance to a producer of an 
agricultural commodity affected by a crop loss or a decline in prices of 
agricultural commodities.
    (b) Violation determinations are made by FCIC. However, upon notice 
from FCIC to CCC that a producer has been found to have committed a 
violation to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, that person 
shall be considered ineligible for payments under the programs specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section that are funded by CCC for the same 
period of time for which, as determined by FCIC, the producer will be 
ineligible for crop insurance benefits of the kind referred to in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Appeals of the determination of 
ineligibility will be administered under the rules set by FCIC.
    (c) Other sanctions may also apply.

meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the 
public or any information which is proposed to be withheld from the 
public on the basis of one or more of the exemptions in Sec. 1409.4(a)

    (3) A single vote of the entire membership of the Board may be taken 
with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are 
proposed to be closed to the public or with respect to the withholding 
of any information concerning such series of meetings, on the basis of 
one or more of the exemptions in Sec. 1409.4(a) of this part. Each 
meeting in such series must involve the same particular matters and must 
be scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial

the Board business requires that a meeting be called at an earlier date, 
but in such case, announcement of the meeting will be made at the 
earliest practicable time.

<R05>
Sec. 1410.3  General description.

    (a) Under the CRP, CCC will enter into contracts with eligible 
participants to convert eligible land to a conserving use during the 
contract period in return for financial and technical assistance.
    (b) A participant must obtain and adhere to a conservation plan 
prepared in accordance with CRP guidelines, as established and 
determined by CCC. A conservation plan for eligible acreage must be 
obtained by a participant and must be approved by the conservation 
district in which the lands are located unless the conservation district 
declines to review the plan, in which case the provider of technical 
assistance may take such further action as is needed to account for lack 
of such review.
    (c) The objectives of the CRP are to cost-effectively reduce water 
and wind erosion, protect the Nation's long-term capability to produce 
food and fiber, reduce sedimentation, improve water quality, create and 
enhance wildlife habitat, and other objectives including encouraging 
more permanent conservation practices and tree planting.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided, a participant may, in addition to 
any payments under this part, receive cost-share assistance, rental or 
easement payments, tax benefits, or other payments from a State or a 
private organization in return for enrolling lands in CRP. However, a 
participant may not receive or retain CRP cost-share assistance if other 
Federal cost-share assistance is provided for such acreage under any 
law, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. Further, under no 
circumstances may the cost-share payments received under this part, or 
otherwise, exceed the cost of the practice, as determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.4  Maximum county acreage.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the maximum 
acreage that may be placed in the CRP and the WRP may not exceed 25 
percent of the total cropland in the county; further, no more than 10 
percent of the cropland may be subject, in the aggregate, to a CRP or 
WRP easement.
    (b) The restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section may be waived 
by CCC if CCC determines that such action would not adversely affect the 
local economy of the county and that operators in the county are having 
difficulties complying with conservation plans implemented under part 12 
of this title.
    (c) These restrictions on participation shall be in addition to any 
other restriction imposed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.5  Eligible persons.

    (a) In order to be eligible to enter into a CRP contract in 
accordance with this part, a person must be an owner, operator, or 
tenant of eligible land and:
    (1) If an operator of eligible land, seeking to participate without 
the owner, must have operated such land for at least 12 months prior to 
the close of the applicable signup period and must provide satisfactory 
evidence that such operator will be in control of such eligible land for 
the full term of the CRP contract period;
    (2) If an owner of eligible land, must have owned such land for at 
least 12 months prior to the close of the applicable signup period, 
unless:
    (i) The new owner acquired such land by will or succession as a 
result of the death of the previous owner;
    (ii) The only ownership change in the 12-month period occurred due 
to foreclosure on the land and the owner of the land, immediately before 
the foreclosure, exercises a timely right of redemption from the 
mortgage holder in accordance with State law; or
    (iii) As determined by the Deputy Administrator, the circumstances 
of the acquisition are such that present adequate assurance that the new 
owner of such eligible land did not acquire such

[[Page 358]]

land for the purpose of placing it in the CRP; or
    (3) If a tenant, the tenant is a participant with an eligible owner 
or operator.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, under continuous 
signup provisions authorized by Sec. 1410.30, an otherwise eligible 
person must have owned or operated, as appropriate, the eligible land 
for at least 12 months before submitting the offer.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.6  Eligible land.

    (a) In order to be eligible to be placed in the CRP, land must be 
one of the following:
    (1) Cropland that is subject to a conservation plan and has been 
annually planted or considered planted, as defined in Sec. 1410.2, to 
an agricultural commodity in 4 of the 6 crop years from 1996 through 
2001, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, provided further that 
field margins that are incidental to the planting of crops may also be 
considered qualifying cropland to the extent determined appropriate by 
the Deputy Administrator; and is physically and legally capable of being 
planted in a normal manner to an agricultural commodity, as determined 
by the Deputy Administrator; or
    (2) Marginal pasture land, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, that:
    (i) Is enrolled in the crop year or has been enrolled during any of 
the 2 years preceding the crop year in the WBP; and
    (A) The WBP contract of the owner or operator of the cropland 
expired or will expire in calendar year 2000, 2001, or 2002; and
    (B) The acreage is not classified as naturally occurring type 3 
through 7 wetlands, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, 
regardless of whether the acreage is or is not protected by a Federal 
agency easement or mortgage restriction (types 3 through 7 wetlands that 
are normally artificially flooded shall not be precluded from 
eligibility), and;
    (C) Enrollment in CRP would enhance the environmental benefits of 
the site, as determined by Deputy Administrator; or
    (ii) Is determined to be suitable for use as a riparian buffer or is 
made eligible in a CREP for similar water quality purposes as determined 
by the Deputy Administrator. A field or portion of a field of marginal 
pasture land may be considered to be suitable for use as a riparian 
buffer only if, as determined CCC, it:
    (A) Is located adjacent to permanent stream corridors excluding 
corridors that are considered gullies or sod waterways; and
    (B) Is capable, when permanent grass, forbs, shrubs, or trees, are 
grown, or when planted with appropriate vegetation for the area, 
including vegetation suitable for wetland restoration or wildlife 
habitat, as determined appropriate by the Deputy Administrator, of 
substantially reducing sediment and/or nutrient runoff that otherwise 
would be delivered to the adjacent stream or waterbody or for water 
quality purposes; or
    (3) Must be acreage enrolled in the CRP during the final year of the 
CRP contract provided the scheduled expiration date of the current CRP 
contract is before the effective date the new CRP contract, as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) Land qualifying under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a) (2) of this 
section must also meet one of the following criteria, to be eligible for 
a contract:
    (1) Be a field or portion of a field determined to be suitable for 
use, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, as a permanent wildlife 
habitat, filter strip, riparian buffer, contour grass strip, grass 
waterway, field windbreak, shelterbelt, living snowfence, other uses as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, land devoted to vegetation on 
salinity producing areas, including any applicable recharge area, or any 
area determined eligible for CRP based on wetland or wellhead protection 
area criteria. A field or portion of a field may be considered to be 
suitable for use as a filter strip or riparian buffer only if it, as 
determined by CCC:
    (i) Is located adjacent to a stream, other waterbody of a permanent 
nature (such as a lake, pond, or sinkhole), or wetland; excluding such 
areas as gullies or sod waterways; and

    (b) Subject to CCC review, State FSA committees, in consultation 
with NRCS and the State Technical Committee, may designate conservation 
priority areas within guidelines established by the Deputy 
Administrator. Such designation must clearly define conservation and 
environmental objectives and provide analysis of how CRP can cost-
effectively address such objectives. Generally, the total acreage of all 
conservation priority areas, in aggregate, shall not total more than 33 
percent of the cropland in a State unless there are identified and 
documented extraordinary environmental needs, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator.
    (c) As determined by the Deputy Administrator, a region shall be 
eligible for designation as a priority area only if the region has 
actual significant adverse water quality, air quality, wildlife habitat, 
or other natural resource impacts related to activities of agricultural 
production, or if the designation helps agricultural producers to comply 
with Federal and State environmental laws.
    (d) Conservation priority area designations shall expire after 5 
years unless re-designated, except they may be withdrawn:
    (1) At the request of the appropriate State water quality agency; or
    (2) By the Deputy Administrator.
    (e) In those areas designated as conservation priority areas, under 
this section, cropland is considered eligible for enrollment according 
Sec. 1410.6(b)(10) based on identified environmental concerns. These 
concerns may include water quality, such as assisting agricultural 
producers to comply with nonpoint source pollution requirements, air 
quality, or wildlife habitat (especially for threatened and endangered 
species or those species that may become threatened and endangered), as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator.

wetlands while under such contract, may, if approved by CCC, subject to 
any restrictions as may be imposed by law, apply to transfer such 
eligible acres subject to such contract that are devoted to an approved 
cover from the CRP to the WRP. Transferred acreage shall be terminated 
from the CRP effective the day a WRP easement is filed. Participants 
will receive a prorated CRP annual payment for that part of the year the 
acreage was enrolled in the CRP according to Sec. 1410.42. Refunds of 
cost-share payments or applicable incentive payments need not be 
refunded unless specified by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) An owner or operator who has enrolled acreage in the CRP may, as 
determined and approved by CCC, restore suitable acres to wetlands with 
cost-share assistance provided that Federal cost-share assistance has 
not been received for wetland restoration on the same land. In addition

return for enrolling lands in CRP. However, as provided under Sec. 
1410.40(f), a participant may not receive or retain CRP cost-share 
assistance if other Federal cost-share assistance is provided for such 
acreage, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. Further, under no 
circumstances may the cost-share payments received under this part, or 
otherwise, exceed the cost of the practice, as determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.42  Annual rental payments.

    (a) Subject to the availability of funds, annual rental payments 
shall be made in such amount and in accordance with such time schedule 
as may be agreed upon and specified in the CRP contract.
    (b) Annual rental payments, except for land accepted that was 
formerly enrolled under the WBP, include a payment based on a weighted 
average soil rental rate or marginal pastureland rental rate, as 
appropriate, and an incentive payment as a portion of the annual payment 
of certain practices, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. 
Payments for land accepted that was formerly enrolled under the WBP are 
limited to annual rental payments received under the WBP.
    (c) The annual rental payment shall be divided among the 
participants on a single contract as agreed to in such contract.
    (d) The maximum amount of rental payments that a person may receive 
under the CRP for any fiscal year shall not exceed $50,000. The 
regulations set forth at part 1400 of this chapter shall be applicable 
in making eligibility and ``person'' determinations as they apply to 
payment limitations under this part.
    (e) In the case of a contract succession, annual rental payments 
shall be divided between the predecessor and the successor participants 
as agreed to among the participants and approved by CCC. If there is no 
agreement among the participants, annual rental payments shall be 
divided in such manner deemed appropriate by the Deputy Administrator 
and such distribution may be prorated based on the actual days of 
ownership of the property by each party.
    (f) CCC shall, when appropriate, prepare a schedule for each county 
that shows the maximum soil rental rate

[[Page 367]]

CCC may pay which may be supplemented to reflect special contract 
requirements. As determined by the Deputy Administrator, such schedule 
will be calculated based on the relative productivity of soils within 
the county using NRCS data and local FSA average cash rental estimates. 
The schedule will be available in the local FSA office and, as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, shall indicate, when 
appropriate, that:
    (1) Offers of contracts by producers who request rental payments 
greater than the schedule for their soil(s) will be rejected;
    (2) Offers of contracts submitted under continuous signup authorized 
at Sec. 1410.30 may be accepted without further evaluation when the 
requested rental rate is less than or equal to the calculated weighted 
soil rental rate, based on the three predominant soils listed; and
    (3) Otherwise qualifying offers shall be ranked competitively based 
on factors established under Sec. 1410.31 of this part in order to 
provide the most cost-effective environmental benefits, as determined by 
the Deputy Administrator.
    (g) Additional financial incentives may be provided to producers who 
offer contracts expected to provide especially high environmental 
benefits, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.43  Method of payment.

    Except as provided in Sec. 1410.50, payments made by CCC under this 
part may be made in cash or other methods of payment in accordance with 
part 1401 of this chapter, unless otherwise specified by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.44  Adjusted Gross Income.

    Benefits under this part shall not be available to persons whose 
adjusted gross income exceeds 2.5 million dollars annually as determined 
under the standards set out in part 1400 of this chapter which shall be 
applicable in making adjusted gross income determinations as they apply 
to the CRP.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 1410.45-1410.49  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1410.50  Enhancement programs.

    (a) For contracts to which a State, political subdivision, or agency 
thereof, has succeeded in connection with an approved conservation 
reserve state enhancement program, payments shall be made in the form of 
cash only. The provisions that limit the amount of payments per year 
that a person may receive under this part shall not be applicable to 
payments received by such State, political subdivision, or agency 
thereof in connection with agreements entered into under such 
enhancement programs carried out by such State, political subdivision, 
or agency thereof that has been approved for that purpose by CCC.
    (b) CCC may enter into other conservation reserve enhancement 
program agreements in accordance with terms deemed appropriate by CCC, 
with a State, political subdivision, or agency thereof, to use the CRP 
to cost-effectively further specific conservation and environmental 
objectives of that State and the nation.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.51  Transfer of land.

    (a)(1) If a new owner or operator purchases or obtains the right and 
interest in, or right to occupancy of, the land subject to a CRP 
contract, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, such new owner or 
operator, upon the approval of CCC, may become a participant to a new 
CRP contract with CCC for the transferred land.
    (2) For the transferred land, if the new owner or operator becomes a 
successor to the existing CRP contract, the new owner or operator shall 
assume all obligations of the CRP contract of the previous participant.
    (3) If the new owner or operator is approved as a successor to a CRP 
contract with CCC, then, except as otherwise determined appropriate by 
the Deputy Administrator:
    (i) Cost-share payments shall be made to the past or present 
participant who established the practice; and
    (ii) Annual rental payments to be paid during the fiscal year when 
the land was transferred shall be divided between the new participant 
and the

[[Page 368]]

previous participant in the manner specified in Sec. 1410.42.
    (b) If a participant transfers all or part of the right and interest 
in, or right to occupancy of, land subject to a CRP contract and the new 
owner or operator does not become a successor to such contract within 60 
days, or such other time as the Deputy Administrator determines to be 
appropriate, of such transfer, such contract shall be terminated with 
respect to the affected portion of such land and the original 
participant:
    (1) Forfeits all rights to any future payments for that acreage;
    (2) Shall refund all previous payments received under the contract 
by the participant or prior participants, plus interest, except as 
otherwise specified by the Deputy Administrator. The provisions of Sec. 
1410.32(h) shall apply.
    (c) Federal agencies acquiring property, by foreclosure or 
otherwise, that contains CRP contract acreage cannot be a party to the 
contract by succession. However, through an addendum to the CRP 
contract, if the current operator of the property is one of the contract 
participants, such operator may, as permitted by CCC, continue to 
receive payments under such contract if:
    (1) The property is maintained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract;
    (2) Such operator continues to be the operator of the property; and
    (3) Ownership of the property remains with such federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.52  Violations.

    (a)(1) If a participant fails to carry out the terms and conditions 
of a CRP contract, CCC may terminate the CRP contract.
    (2) If the CRP contract is terminated by CCC in accordance with this 
paragraph:
    (i) The participant shall forfeit all rights to further payments 
under such contract and refund all payments previously received 
together, plus interest; and
    (ii) Pay liquidated damages to CCC in an amount as specified in the 
contract.
    (b) If the Deputy Administrator determines such failure does not 
warrant termination of such contract, the Deputy Administrator may 
authorize relief as the Deputy Administrator deems appropriate.
    (c) CCC may reduce a demand for a refund under this section to the 
extent CCC determines that such relief would be appropriate and will not 
deter the accomplishment of the goals of the program.
    (d) Crop insurance purchase requirements in part 1405 of this 
chapter apply to contracts executed in accordance with this part.

<R05>
Sec. 1410.53  Executed CRP contract not in conformity with regulations.

    If, after a CRP contract is approved by CCC, it is discovered that 
such CRP contract is not in conformity with this part, these regulations 
shall prevail, and CCC may, at its sole discretion, terminate or modify 
the CRP contract, effective immediately or at a later date as CCC 
determines appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.54  Performance based upon advice or action of the Department.

    The provisions of Sec. 718.8 of this chapter relating to 
performance based upon the action or advice of an authorized 
representative of the Department shall be applicable to this part, and 
may be considered as a basis to provide relief to persons subject to 
sanctions under this part to the extent that relief is otherwise 
required by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.55  Access to land under contract.

    (a) Any representative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or 
designee thereof, shall, for purposes related to this program, be 
provided by the offeror or participant as the case may be, with access 
to land that is:
    (1) The subject of an application for a contract under this part; or
    (2) Under contract or otherwise subject to this part.
    (b) For land identified in paragraph (a) of this section, the

to examine records for the land to determine land classification, 
erosion rates, or other purposes and to determine whether it is in 
compliance with the terms and conditions of the CRP contract.

[[Page 369]]


<R05>
Sec. 1410.56  Division of payments and provisions about tenants and 
sharecroppers.

    (a) Payments received under this part shall be divided as specified 
in the applicable contract and CCC shall ensure that producers who would 
have an interest in acreage being offered receive treatment that is 
equitable, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. CCC may refuse to 
enter into a contract when there is a disagreement among persons seeking 
enrollment as to a person's eligibility to participate in the contract 
as a tenant and there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether the 
person seeking participation as a tenant does or does not have an 
interest in the acreage offered for enrollment in the CRP.
    (b) CCC may remove an operator or tenant from a CRP contract when:
    (1) The operator or tenant requests in writing to be removed from 
the CRP contract;
    (2) The operator or tenant files for bankruptcy and the trustee or 
debtor in possession fails to affirm the contract, to the extent 
permitted by applicable bankruptcy laws;
    (3) The operator or tenant dies during the contract period and the 
administrator of the estate fails to succeed to the contract within a 
period of time determined by the Deputy Administrator; or
    (4) A court of competent jurisdiction orders the removal from the 
CRP contract of the operator or tenant and such order is received by 
FSA, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, tenants shall 
maintain their tenancy throughout the contract period in order to remain 
on a contract. Tenants who fail to maintain tenancy on the acreage under 
contract, including failure to comply with applicable State law, may be 
removed from a contract by CCC. CCC shall assume the tenancy is being 
maintained unless notified otherwise by a party to contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.57  Payments not subject to claims.

    Subject to part 1403 of this chapter, any cost-share or annual 
payment or portion thereof due any person under this part shall be 
allowed without regard to questions of title under State law, and 
without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any creditor, except 
agencies of the United States Government.

the Deputy Administrator may be appealed in accordance with procedures 
established under part 614 of this title or otherwise established by 
NRCS.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.60  Scheme or device.

    (a) If CCC determines that a person has employed a scheme or device 
to defeat the purposes of this part, or any part, of any program, 
payment otherwise due or paid such person during the applicable period 
may be required to be refunded with interest thereon as determined 
appropriate by CCC.
    (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, 
fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of cost-share 
assistance or annual rental payments, or obtaining a payment that 
otherwise would not be payable.
    (c) A new owner or operator or tenant of land subject to this part 
who succeeds to the contract responsibilities shall report in writing to 
CCC any interest of any kind in the land subject to this part that is 
retained by a previous participant. Such interest shall include a 
present, future, or conditional interest, reversionary interest, or any 
option, future or present, on such land, and any interest of any lender 
in such land where the lender has, will, or can legally obtain, a right 
of occupancy to such land or an interest in the equity in such land 
other than

[[Page 370]]

an interest in the appreciation in the value of such land occurring 
after the loan was made. Failure to fully disclose such interest shall 
be considered a scheme or device under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.61  Filing of false claims.

    If CCC determines that any participant has knowingly supplied false 
information or has knowingly filed a false claim, such participant shall 
be ineligible for payments under this part with respect to the program 
year in which the false information or claim was filed and the contract 
may be terminated, in which case a full refund of all prior payments may 
be demanded. False information or false claims include, but are not 
limited to, claims for payment for practices that do not comply with the 
conservation plan. Any amounts paid under these circumstances shall be 
refunded, together plus with interest as determined by CCC, and any 
amounts otherwise due to the participant shall be withheld. The remedies 
provided for in this section shall be in addition to any and all other 
remedies, criminal and/or civil, that may apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.62  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, in the case of death, 
incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, any payments due 
under this part shall be paid to the participant's successor(s) under 
part 707 of this title.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in this part, payments under this 
part shall be subject to the requirements of part 12 of this title 
concerning highly erodible land and wetland conservation and payments.
    (c) Any remedies permitted CCC under this part shall be in addition 
to any other remedy, including, but not limited to, criminal remedies, 
or actions for damages in favor of CCC, or the United States, as may be 
permitted by law; provided further the Deputy Administrator may add to 
the contract such additional terms as needed to enforce these 
regulations that shall be binding on the parties and may be enforced to 
the same degree as provisions of these regulations.
    (d) Absent a scheme or device to defeat the purpose of the program, 
when an owner loses control of CRP acreage due to foreclosure and the 
new owner chooses not to continue the contract in accordance with Sec. 
1410.51, refunds shall not be required from any participant on the 
contract to the extent that the Deputy Administrator determines that 
forgiving such repayment is appropriate in order to provide fair and 
equitable treatment.
    (e) Cropland enrolled in CRP shall be classified as cropland for the 
time period enrolled in CRP and, after the time period of enrollment, 
may be removed from such classification upon a determination by the 
county committee that such land no longer meets the definition in part 
718 of this title.
    (f) Research projects may be submitted by the State committee and 
authorized by the Deputy Administrator to further the purposes of CRP. 
The research projects must include objectives that are consistent with 
this part, provide economic and environmental information, not adversely 
affect local agricultural markets, and be conducted and monitored by a 
bona fide research entity, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.63  Permissive uses.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified by the Deputy Administrator, no uses 
of any kind are authorized on designated CRP acreage during the contract

such as the State fish and wildlife agency or State department of 
natural resources;
    (2) The commercial shooting preserve is operated in a manner 
consistent with the applicable State agency rules governing commercial 
shooting preserves;
    (3) CRP cover is maintained according to the conservation plan; and
    (4) No barrier fencing or boundary limitations exist that prohibit 
wildlife access to or from the CRP acreage unless required by State law.
    (c) The following activities may be permitted on CRP enrolled land 
insofar as they are consistent with the soil, water, and wildlife 
conservation purposes of the program:

[[Page 371]]

    (1) Managed haying and grazing, including the harvest of biomass:
    (i) In exchange for a reduction of the annual payment in an amount 
determined by the Deputy Administrator;
    (ii) Not to exceed once every three years after the CRP vegetative 
cover has been established; and
    (iii) According to an approved CRP conservation plan in accordance 
with FOTG standards and ensuring that managed haying and grazing 
activities occur outside the official nesting and brood rearing season 
for those plans.
    (2) Managed grazing that is incidental to the gleaning of crop 
residue, but only in exchange for a reduction in the annual rental 
payment, as determined appropriate by the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) Wind turbines on CRP land installed in numbers and locations as 
determined appropriate by the Deputy Administrator considering the 
location, size, and other physical characteristics of the land, the 
extent to which the land contains wildlife, wildlife habitat, and the 
purposes of the CRP.
    (4) Spot grazing, if necessary for control of weed infestation, not 
to exceed a 30-day period according to an approved conservation plan, 
but only in exchange for a payment reduction determined by the Deputy

improvement on lands converted to forestry use only in accordance with a 
conservation plan and in exchange for an applicable reduction in the 
annual rental payment as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (6) The sale of carbon, water quality, or other environmental 
credits, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

that crop year shall be zero for the purposes of determining the 4-year 
average, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (d) If the acreage planted or prevented from being planted was 
devoted to a different covered commodity in the same crop year (other 
than a covered commodity produced under an established practice of 
double-cropping), the owner may select the commodity

Sec. 1412.302  Direct payment yield for soybeans and other oilseeds.

    (a) The direct payment yield for soybeans and each other oilseed for 
the farm shall be determined by multiplying the weighted average yield 
per planted acre for the crop on the farm, as determined in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, times the ratio resulting from:
    (1) The national average yield for the crop for the 1981 through 
1985 crop years, as determined by CCC, divided by
    (2) The national average yield for the crop for the 1998 through 
2001 crop years, as determined by CCC.
    (b)(1) The yield per planted acre for soybeans and each other 
oilseed on the farm, to be used for direct payment purposes, is 
calculated as follows:
    (i) The sum of the production of the crop for the 1998 through 2001 
crop years, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section; divided by
    (ii) The sum of the total planted acres of the crop for the 1998 
through 2001 crop years.
    (2) The production of the crop for each of the 1998 through 2001 
crop years shall be the higher of the following, except in a year in 
which the acreage planted to the crop was zero, in which case the 
production for the crop for such year shall be zero:

[[Page 377]]

    (i) The total production for the applicable year based on the 
production evidence submitted in accordance with Sec. 1412.304; or
    (ii) The amount equal to the product of:
    (A) The total planted acres for the crop, times
    (B) 75 percent of the harvested average county yield for that crop 
determined, where practicable, by calculating the weighted 4-year 
average of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) harvested 
acreage yields for the crop using the 1998 through 2001 crop years.
    (3) The NASS harvested acreage yield to be used in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section shall be based on:
    (i) NASS harvested irrigated yield for the crop, if available, for 
producers who irrigated the crop in the applicable years;
    (ii) NASS harvested non-irrigated yield for the crop, if available, 
for producers who did not irrigate the crop in the applicable years; or
    (iii) NASS harvested blended yield for all acreage, regardless of 
whether or not the acres were irrigated or non-irrigated, for all crops 
in all counties for which the yields in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section are unavailable.
    (4) If NASS harvested acreage yield data is not available, the 
Deputy Administrator shall assign a yield to be used in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.303  Payment yield for counter-cyclical payments for covered 
commodities.

    (a)(1) The counter-cyclical payment yield for covered commodities on 
the farm shall be equal to the direct payment yield for the covered 
commodity on the farm unless the owner elects to partially update the 
yield for all covered commodities on the farm in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Only owners who establish base acres for the farm in accordance 
with Sec. 1412.201(a)(1) shall have the opportunity to partially update 
the counter-cyclical payment yield for the covered commodities on the 
farm.
    (3) The partially updated yield shall be used for the calculation of 
the counter-cyclical payments only. The partially updated counter-
cyclical yield shall not be used for the calculation of any direct 
payments for any covered commodity.
    (4) Owners who elect to partially update counter-cyclical payment 
yields in accordance with this section must:
    (i) Make such election at the same time such owner makes the base 
election in accordance with Sec. 1412.201; and
    (ii) Update counter-cyclical payment yields for all covered 
commodities on the farm using the same method. Updating counter-cyclical 
payment yields for fewer than all covered commodities on the farm is not 
allowed. Updating counter-cyclical payment yields for covered 
commodities on a farm using different methods for different covered 
commodities is not allowed.
    (b) Owners on a farm who established base acres for the farm in 
accordance with Sec. 1412.201(a)(1) may select one of the following 
methods to partially update counter-cyclical payment yields for all 
covered commodities on the farm. The same method must be used to 
partially update the counter-cyclical payment yield for all covered 
commodities on the farm.

    (B) The payment yield calculated for the covered commodity in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 1412.301 or 1412.302, as applicable.
    (2) 93.5 percent of the average yield per planted acre for the crop 
on the farm, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c)(1) The yield per planted acre for covered commodities on the 
farm is calculated as follows:
    (i) The sum of the production of the crop for 1998 through 2001 crop 
years, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, divided by

[[Page 378]]

    (ii) The sum of the total planted acres of the crop for the 1998 
through 2001 crop years.
    (2) The production of the crop for each of the 1998 through 2001

    (i) The total production for the applicable year based on the 
production evidence submitted in accordance with Sec. 1412.304; or
    (ii) The amount equal to the product of:
    (A) The total planted acres for the crop, times
    (B) 75 percent of the harvested average county yield for that crop 
determined, where practicable, by calculating the weighted 4-year 
average of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) harvested 
acreage yields for the crop using the 1998 through 2001 crop years.
    (3) The NASS harvested acreage yield to be used in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section shall be based on:
    (i) NASS harvested irrigated yield for the crop, if available, for 
producers who irrigated the crop in the applicable years;
    (ii) NASS harvested non-irrigated yield for the crop, if available, 
for producers who did not irrigate the crop in the applicable years; or
    (iii) NASS harvested blended yield for all acreage, regardless of 
whether or not the acres were irrigated or non-irrigated, for all crops 
in all counties where the yields in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section are unavailable.
    (4) If NASS harvested acreage yield data is not available, the 
Deputy Administrator shall assign a yield to be used in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

through non-commercial channels, such as used for feed, grazing, or 
silage, if Loan Deficiency Payments are not available, but crop 
insurance records or other FSA records indicate that the use of the crop 
was for silage, hay, or grazing, then county committee will assign 
production for that year based

[[Page 379]]

on the actual grain yield of three similar farms for the applicable 
year. If producers cannot meet any of these requirements or their crop 
suffered a low yield, then 75 percent of the county average yield as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 1412.302(b)(4) will be used.
    (d) CCC may verify the production evidence submitted with records on 
file at the warehouse, gin, or other entity which received or may have 
received the reported production.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.305  Incorrect or false production evidence.

    (a) If production evidence is false or incorrect, as determined by 
the county committee, the county committee shall determine whether the 
owner or producer submitting the production evidence for a farm acted in 
good faith or took action to defeat the purpose of the program.
    (b)(1) If the county committee determines the production evidence 
submitted is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, and the owner or 
producer who submitted the evidence did not act in good faith or took 
action to defeat the purpose of the program, the county committee shall:
    (i) Require a refund of all direct and counter-cyclical payments 
earned for the farm for the first year such payments were made;
    (ii) Reduce the counter-cyclical payment yields for all crops on the 
farm to equal the direct payment yield for all crops except oilseeds. 
For all oilseeds on the farm, both the direct and counter-cyclical 
payment yields shall be reduced to 75 percent of the county average 
yield as determined in accordance with Sec. 1412.302(b)(4). That yield 
shall then be reduced by the applicable direct payment yield factor in 
accordance with Sec. 1412.302(a)(1); and
    (iii) Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, require a 
refund of an amount equal to the following for each covered commodity 
and peanuts for each year the false, incorrect or unacceptable yield was 
used to make payments under the contract:
    (A) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments made using 
the false, incorrect or unacceptable evidence, minus
    (B) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments that would 
have been made based on the yields established in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the county 
committee determines that the production evidence submitted is false, 
incorrect, or unacceptable, and the owner or producer who submitted the

including but not limited to any or all of the following:
    (i) Make a further yield reduction for part or all of the covered 
commodities and peanuts on the farm;
    (ii) Make further payment reductions or refunds;
    (iii) Determine that the owner or producer who submitted the 
evidence is ineligible for participation in future contracts; or
    (iv) Take other legal action.
    (c) If the county committee determines the production evidence 
submitted is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, and the owner or 
producer who submitted the evidence acted in good faith and did not take 
action to defeat the purpose of the program, the county committee shall:
    (1) Correct the counter-cyclical yield for the applicable crop to 
equal the yield that would have been calculated in accordance with Sec. 
1412.303 based on accurate production evidence; and
    (2) Require a refund of an amount equal to the following for each 
covered commodity and peanuts for each year the false, incorrect or 
unacceptable yield was used to make payments under the contract:
    (i) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments made using 
the false, incorrect or unacceptable evidence, minus
    (ii) The sum of the direct and counter-cyclical payments that would

Sec. 1412.401  Direct and counter-cyclical program contract.

    (a)(1) With respect to Fiscal Year 2002 payments, CCC will offer to 
enter into a contract with eligible producers of covered commodities and 
historical peanut producers on October 1, 2002 through the date 
announced by CCC. With respect to Fiscal Years 2003 through 2007, CCC 
shall offer to annually enter into a contract with an eligible producer 
on a farm having base acreage with respect to a covered commodity; and 
for a farm with peanut base acreage and yield assigned in accordance 
with subpart G of this part, at the beginning of each such fiscal year 
2003 through 2007 through the date announced by CCC for each such year.
    (2)(i) Eligible producers may execute and submit a contract to the 
county FSA office where the records for the farm are administratively 
maintained not later than June 1 of the fiscal year in which the direct 
and counter-cyclical payments are requested.
    (ii) Because CCC will incur additional expenses which may not be 
possible to quantify with certainty, including the additional cost to 
ensure payments are issued timely to all producers, a late signup fee in 
the amount of $100 per farm will be assessed by CCC for any farm 
enrolled after June 1 of the fiscal year in which the direct and 
counter-cyclical payments are requested unless the Deputy Administrator 
determines a waiver of the late signup fee is appropriate. Enrollment is 
not allowed after September 30 of the fiscal year in which the direct 
and counter-cyclical payments are requested.
    (3) Eligible producers who elect to enter into a contract with CCC 
must enroll all base acres on the farm. Enrollment of fewer than all 
base acres on the farm is not allowed.
    (b) Eligible producers may withdraw from a contract at any time on 
or before September 30 of the year of the contract provided all 
signatories to the contract, including CCC, agree to the withdraw.
    (c) All contracts shall expire on September 30 of the fiscal year of 
the contract unless:
    (1) Withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) Terminated in accordance with paragraphs (d) or (e) of this 
section; or
    (3) Terminated at an earlier date by mutual consent of all parties, 
including CCC.
    (d) A transfer or change in the interest of a producer in base acres 
on the farm subject to a contract shall result in the termination of the 
contract with respect to such interest, and a refund of applicable 
direct and counter-cyclical payments issued for the farm. The contract 
termination shall be effective on the date of the transfer or change. 
Successors-in-interest on a farm subject to a contract may assume all 
obligations under the contract no later than September 30 of the 
contract year, and receive payment under the contract only after 
applicable direct and counter-cyclical payments previously issued to the 
predecessor for the farm have been refunded to CCC, or a debt for any 
amount not refunded to CCC has been established for the predecessor.
    (e) In the event a farm reconstitution is completed in accordance 
with part 718 of this title, all producers with an interest in the base 
acres on the farm must sign a new contract and provide supporting 
documentation as specified in part 12 of this title, and parts 1400, and 
1412 of this chapter not later than September 30 of the fiscal year 
direct and counter-cyclical payments are requested, after receiving 
written notification by the county committee indicating the 
reconstitution is completed. If all producers have not signed the new 
contract by September 30, no producers on the contract will be eligible 
for a direct or counter-cyclical payment for that farm for the year the 
contract was terminated.

Sec. 1412.402  Eligible producers.

    Producers eligible to enter into a contract are:
    (a)(1) An owner of a farm who assumes all or a part of the risk of 
producing a crop;
    (2) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm with a share-rent 
lease for such farm, regardless of the length of the lease, if the owner 
of the farm enters into the same contract;
    (3) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm who cash rents such 
farm under a lease expiring on or after September 30 of the year of the 
contract in which case the owner is not required to enter into the 
contract;
    (4) A producer, other than an owner, on an eligible farm who cash 
rents such farm under a lease expiring before September 30 of the year 
of the contract. The owner of such farm must also enter into the same 
contract; or
    (5) An owner of an eligible farm who cash rents such farm and the 
lease term expires before September 30 of the year of the contract, if 
the tenant declines to enter into a contract for the applicable year. In 
the case of an owner covered by this paragraph, direct and counter-
cyclical payments shall not begin under the contract until the lease 
held by the tenant ends.
    (b) A minor child shall be eligible to enter into a contract only if 
one of the following conditions exist:
    (1) The right of majority has been conferred upon the minor by court 
proceedings or statute;
    (2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property, 
and the applicable program documents are executed by the guardian; or
    (3) A bond is furnished under which a surety guarantees any loss 
incurred for which the minor would be liable had the minor been an 
adult.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.403  Reconstitutions.

    Farms shall be reconstituted in accordance with part 718 of this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.404  Notification of base acres.

    The owner and all producers on a farm shall be notified in writing 
of the number of base acres eligible for enrollment in a contract, 
unless such owner or producer requests in writing that such owner or 
producer not be furnished with the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.405  Reducing base acreage.

    (a)(1) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (a)(ii) of this 
section, a permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base 
acreage shall be allowed when all owners of the farm execute and submit 
a written request for such reduction on a CCC-approved standard, uniform 
form designated by CCC to the FSA county office where the records for 
the farm are administratively maintained.
    (2) A permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base 
acreage to negate or reduce a program violation is not allowed.
    (b) When base acres on a farm are converted to a non-agricultural 
commercial or industrial use, the total base acreage on the farm shall 
be reduced accordingly regardless of the submission of a request for 
such reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.406  Succession-in-interest to a direct and counter-cyclical 
program contract.

    (a) A succession in interest to a contract may be permitted if there 
has been a change in the operation of a farm, such as:
    (1) A sale of land;
    (2) A change of operator or producer, including a change in a 
partnership that increases or decreases the number of partners;
    (3) A foreclosure, bankruptcy, or involuntary loss of the farm;
    (4) A change in producer shares to reflect changes in the producer's 
share of the crop(s) that were originally approved on the contract; or
    (5) As otherwise determined by the Deputy Administrator, if the 
succession will not adversely affect nor defeat the purpose of the 
program.
    (b) A succession in interest to the contract is not permitted if CCC 
determines that the change:
    (1) Results in a violation of the landlord-tenant provisions set 
forth in Sec. 1412.505; or
    (2) Adversely affects or otherwise defeats the purpose of the 
program.

[[Page 382]]

    (c) If a producer who is entitled to receive direct and counter-
cyclical payments dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to 
receive the payment, CCC will make the payment in accordance with part 
707 of this title.
    (d) A producer or owner must inform the county committee of changes 
in interest in base acres on the farm not later than:
    (1) August 1 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the 
change requires a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 
718 of this title; or
    (2) September 30 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if 
the change does not require a reconstitution be completed in accordance 
with part 718 of this title.
    (e)(1) In any case in which either a direct or counter-cyclical 
payment has previously been made to a predecessor, such payment shall 
not be paid to the successor unless payment has been refunded by the 
predecessor, or a debt for any amount not refunded to CCC has been 
established for the predecessor.
    (2) A succession in interest shall not increase the liability of 
CCC.

except as limited elsewhere in this section. Any crop may be planted on 
DCP cropland in excess of the base acreage on a farm.
    (b) Base acreage may be hayed or grazed at any time.
    (c) Harvesting non-perennial fruits, vegetables (except lentils, 
mung beans, and dry peas) or wild rice, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, or designee, is prohibited on base acreage of a farm 
enrolled in a contract. Planting perennial fruits, vegetables (except 
lentils, mung beans, and dry peas) or wild rice, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator, is prohibited on base acreage of a farm enrolled 
in a contract.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
perennial fruits, vegetables and wild rice may be planted on base 
acreage of a farm enrolled in a contract, and non-perennial fruits, 
vegetables and wild rice may be harvested on base acreage of a farm 
enrolled in a contract if:
    (1) A producer double-crops fruits, vegetables or wild rice with a 
covered commodity or peanuts in any region described in paragraph (e) of 
this section, in which case direct and counter-cyclical payments will 
not be reduced for the planting or harvesting of the fruit, vegetable or 
wild rice;
    (2) The farm has a history of planting fruits, vegetables, or wild 
rice, as determined by the CCC, in any one of the crop years 1991 
through 1995 or 1998 through 2001, in which case the payment acres for 
the farm shall be reduced on an acre-for-acre basis; or
    (3) The producer has a history of planting a specific fruit, 
specific vegetable or wild rice, as determined by CCC, the producer may 
plant and harvest the specific fruit, specific vegetable or wild rice 
for which the producer has a planting history, subject to the following:
    (i) The acreage harvested shall not exceed the simple average of the 
sum of acreage of the specific fruit, specific vegetable or wild rice 
planted for harvest by the producer during the crop years 1991 through 
1995 or 1998 through 2001, but not both, as determined by the producer, 
excluding any year in which the specific fruit, specific vegetable or 
wild rice was not planted; and
    (ii) The payment acres for the farm shall be reduced on an acre-for-
acre basis;
    (e) Double-cropping for purposes of this section means planting for 
harvest fruits, vegetables or wild rice on the same acres in cycle with 
a covered commodity or peanuts planted and harvested for grain or lint 
in a 12-month period under normal growing conditions for the region and 
being able to repeat the same cycle in the following 12-month period. 
For purposes of this part, the following counties have been determined 
to be regions having a history of double-cropping covered commodities or 
peanuts with fruits, vegetables or wild rice. State committees have

    (a) Each eligible producer on a farm shall be given the opportunity 
to annually enroll in a contract and receive direct and counter-cyclical 
payments determined to be fair and equitable as agreed to by all the 
producers on the farm and approved by the county committee.
    (1) Each producer must provide a copy of their written lease to the 
county committee and, in the absence of a written lease, must provide to 
the county committee a complete written description of the terms and 
conditions of any oral agreement or lease.
    (2) A lease will be considered to be a cash lease if the lease 
provides for only a guaranteed sum certain cash payment, or a fixed 
quantity of the crop (for example, cash, pounds, or bushels per acre).
    (3) If a lease contains provisions that require the payment of rent 
on the basis of the amount of crop produced or the proceeds derived from 
the crop, or the interest such producer would have had if the crop had 
been produced, or combination thereof, such agreement shall be 
considered to be a share lease. The leasing of grazing or haying 
privileges is not considered cash leasing.
    (4) If a lease provides for the greater of a guaranteed amount or 
share of the crop or crop proceeds, such agreement shall be considered a 
share lease if the lease provides for both:
    (i) A guaranteed amount such as a fixed dollar amount or quantity; 
and
    (ii) A share of the crop proceeds.
    (5) If the lease is a cash lease, the landlord is not eligible for 
direct or counter-cyclical payments.
    (b) When contract acreage is leased on a share basis, neither the 
landlord nor the tenant shall receive 100 percent of the contract 
payment for the farm.
    (c) CCC will approve a contract for enrollment and approve the 
division of payment when all of the following apply:
    (1) The landlords, tenants and sharecroppers sign the contract and 
agree to the payment shares shown on the contract;
    (2) CCC determines that the interests of tenants and sharecroppers 
are being protected; and
    (3) CCC determines that the payment shares shown on the contract do 
not circumvent the provisions of part 1400 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.505  Provisions relating to tenants and sharecroppers.

    Neither direct nor counter-cyclical payments shall be made by CCC 
if:
    (a) The landlord or operator has adopted a scheme or device for the 
purpose of depriving any tenant or sharecropper of the payments to which 
such person would otherwise be entitled under the program. If any of 
such conditions occur or are discovered after payments have been made, 
all or any such part of the payments as the State committee may 
determine shall be refunded to CCC; or
    (b) The landlord terminated a lease in violation of state law as 
determined by a state court.

contract. Upon such termination, all producers subject to the contract 
shall forfeit all rights to receive direct and counter-cyclical payments 
on the farm for the contract year and shall refund all direct and 
counter-cyclical payments received,

[[Page 391]]

plus interest, as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this 
chapter.
    (b)(1) If there is a violation of Sec. 1412.407 and CCC determines 
that a violation is not serious enough to warrant termination of the 
contract under paragraph (a) of this section, direct and counter-
cyclical payments may be made to the producers specified on the 
contract, but in an amount that is reduced by an amount equal to the sum 
of:
    (i) The per-acre market value of the fruits, vegetables, and wild 
rice, as determined by the State Committee, times the number of acres in 
violation, plus
    (ii) The direct and counter-cyclical payments for each such acre.
    (2) Producers must protect land enrolled in DCP from weeds, 
including noxious weeds, and erosion, including providing sufficient 
cover if determined necessary by the county committee. The first 
violation of this provision will result in a reduction in the direct 
payments for the farm by an amount equal to three times the cost of 
maintenance of the acreage, but not to exceed 50 percent of the total 
direct payments for the farm. The second violation of this provision 
will result in a reduction in the direct payments for the farm by an 
amount equal to three times the cost of maintenance of the acreage, not 
to exceed the total direct payments for the farm.

on base acreage of a farm enrolled in DCP is inaccurate and exceeds the 
tolerance as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, but CCC 
determines the producer made a good faith effort to comply with the 
provisions of this section, the producers shall accept a reduction in 
the direct and counter-cyclical payments for the farm in an amount equal 
to the sum of:
    (i) The direct and counter-cyclical payments for each such acre, 
plus
    (ii) Twice the average dollar value of the direct payment for the 
covered commodity and peanut base acreage reduced because of the fruit, 
vegetable, and wild rice plantings on such acreage, multiplied by the 
total number of acres in violation.
    (3) The contract shall be terminated if an acreage report of fruits, 
vegetables or wild rice planted on base acreage of a farm enrolled in 
DCP is inaccurate, and the county committee determines the producer did 
not make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of this 
section. Upon such termination, producers subject to such contract 
shall:
    (i) Forfeit all rights to receive direct and counter-cyclical 
payments for the farm;
    (ii) Refund all direct and counter-cyclical payments received for 
the farm, plus interest as determined in accordance with part 1403 of 
this chapter; and
    (iii) Be ineligible for all program benefits according to part 718 
of this title.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, tolerance is the amount by 
which the determined acreage may differ from the reported acreage and 
still be considered in compliance with program requirements. Tolerance 
for fruits, vegetables and wild rice plantings is 5 percent of the 
reported fruit, vegetable and wild rice acreage, not to exceed 50 acres.

peanut producer under this part, the 4-year average of the following:
    (1) The acreage planted to peanuts on each farm on which the 
historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 
through 2001 crop years; and
    (2) Any acreage on each farm that the historic peanut producer was 
prevented from planting to peanuts during the 1998 through 2001 crop 
years because of natural disaster, or any other condition beyond the 
control of the historic peanut producers, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.

prevented from being planted to peanuts for harvest on the farm, based 
on the sharing arrangement that was in effect among the producers for 
the crop.
    (d) When a historic peanut producer is no longer living or when an 
entity composed of historic peanut producers has been dissolved, and in 
other similar situations, the Deputy Administrator shall make the base

Sec. 1412.702  Determination of average peanut yield.

    (a) The Deputy Administrator shall determine, for each historic 
peanut producer, the average yield for peanuts on each farm the historic 
peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 
crop years, excluding any crop year in which the producer did not plant 
or was prevented from planting peanuts. Production information reported

<R05>
Sec. 1412.802  Administration.

    (a) The program will be administered under the general supervision 
of the Executive Vice President, CCC, and shall be carried out by the 
Farm Service Agency (FSA) State and county committees (State and county

modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines, except statutory deadlines, and 
other non-statutory requirements in cases where lateness or failure to 
meet such other requirements does not adversely affect operation of the 
program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute a contract for a quota 
buyout only under the terms and conditions of this part, and as 
determined and announced by the Executive Vice President, CCC. Any 
contract that is not executed in accordance with such terms and

    (a) Enrollment for the Peanut Quota Buyout Program begins September 
3, 2002, and ends November 22, 2002. Application for payment must be 
made by signing the contract. Payments will be made by CCC to eligible

of each claimant.
    (2) If CCC has made a payment to a peanut quota holder, as 
identified on FSA records, for a farm and after October 11, 2002, a 
person who is not a peanut quota holder, as identified on FSA records, 
for such farm submits a contract or other written claim with CCC for the 
same quota used to issue the initial payment, CCC will issue no further 
payments for such farm until CCC has determined the eligibility status 
of each person who has filed a contract or other written claim for such 
farm and the occurrence of the earlier of:
    (i) Repayment of the initial payment made by CCC; or
    (ii) The establishment, in accordance with part 1403 of this 
chapter, by CCC of a claim for repayment of the initial payment.

peanut quota holder with respect to a farm but who, as of September 3, 
2002, were not the peanut quota holder, as identified on FSA records as 
of May 13, 2002, for such farm will be made by CCC after November 22, 
2002, unless prior to November 22, 2002, CCC has received an 
acknowledgment from the peanut quota holders, as identified on FSA 
records as of May 13, 2002, that they:
    (1) Will not file a contract for such peanut quota; and
    (2) Transferred the peanut quota to such other party prior to May 
13, 2002.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.806  Eligible peanut quota holder.

    (a) A person shall be eligible for a payment under this part only if 
CCC has determined the person to be an ``eligible peanut quota holder'' 
for purposes of this part. To be an eligible peanut quota holder, a 
person must, as of May 13, 2002:
    (1) Have owned a farm, or had a life estate interest in a farm, to 
which paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section do not apply, that was 
eligible for a permanent peanut quota under part 729 of this title, as 
in effect on January 1, 2002, without regard to quotas established for 
seed or experimental purposes or quotas subject to temporary leases or 
temporary transfers;
    (2) Be a party to a written contract for the purchase of all or a 
portion of the farm identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that 
was in effect on or before May 13, 2002. If the parties to the contract 
are unable to agree to the division of the applicable peanut quota on 
the land subject to the written contract, the Deputy Administrator, 
taking into account any incomplete or permanent transfer of the peanut 
quota that has otherwise been agreed to, shall provide for the equitable 
division of the payments made under this part by determining the 
eligible peanut quota holders and allocating the disputed amount of the 
peanut quota to such holders. This allocation will take into account the 
ratio of cropland on the unsold portion of the farm and the cropland on 
the portion of the farm subject to the purchase contract;

[[Page 396]]

    (3) Be a party to a written contract that was in effect on or before 
May 13, 2002, for the permanent transfer of a peanut quota to such 
party's farm but was not completed by that date. In such a case, the 
eligible peanut quota holder is the owner of the farm, as of May 13, 
2002, to which the peanut quota was to be transferred; or
    (4) Have owned a farm with a peanut quota which is protected under a 
Conservation Reserve Program contract in accordance with part 1410 of 
this chapter;
    (b) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (a) of this section, 
CCC may determine that a person is an eligible peanut quota holder with 
respect to an amount of peanut quota for the purposes of this section, 
to the exclusion of all other persons in order to provide for the fair 
and equitable administration of this part so long as the total amount of 
eligible quota pounds for all program participants does not exceed the 
quantity of peanut quota that was available to all quota holders in the 
2001 crop year.
    (c) Sales and transfers of farms and peanut quotas may be 
disregarded by CCC when:
    (1) Such sales and transfers were required to be reported to FSA 
under part 729 of this title; or
    (2) It is otherwise determined by CCC that it would be unfair and 
inequitable in the overall administration of the program to make or 
modify an eligibility determination based on claims of transfers or 
sales that preceded January 1, 2002.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.807  Contract provisions.

    (a)(1) CCC will, on a per-farm basis, offer to enter into a contract 
with each eligible peanut quota holder on such farm under which CCC will 
provide a payment in five equal installments in each of the 2002 though 
2006 fiscal years or in one lump sum payment in any such fiscal year as 
selected by such holder.
    (2) Eligible peanut quota holders who elect to receive five equal 
installments payments will receive the fiscal year 2002 payment no later 
than December 31, 2002 and, as determined by CCC, between January 2 and 
January 31 in each of the years 2003 through 2006.
    (3) Eligible peanut quota holders who elect to receive one lump sum 
payment may specify the fiscal year in which they wish to receive a 
payment. CCC will determine the day in such fiscal year that the payment 
will be made by CCC.
    (b) The amount of each payment made under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section shall be the product determined by multiplying:
    (1) $0.11 per pound; times
    (2) The amount of eligible quota pounds of the eligible peanut quota 
holder.
    (c) The amount of each payment made under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section shall be the product determined by multiplying the product 
determined under paragraph (b) of this section times five.
    (d) After a payment option has been selected under paragraph (a) of 
this section and a payment has been made by CCC, no change in the 
payment option will be allowed except as authorized by the Executive 
Vice President, CCC.

    All signatories to a contract are jointly and severally liable for 
contract violations and resulting repayments and liquidated damages.

determination made in accordance with this subpart;
    (b) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program; or
    (c) Made any fraudulent representation affecting a program 
determination made in accordance with this subpart, must refund all

quota or the farm for which a peanut quota had been established under 
part 729 of this title by any creditor or any other person.
    (b) Any person eligible to receive a payment made under this subpart 
may assign the payment in accordance with part 1404 of this chapter.

applicable to payments made under this subpart.
    (b) The provisions of part 707 of this title relating to the making 
of payments in the event of the death of a program participant and in 
the event of other special circumstances shall apply to payments made

<R05>
Sec. 1415.1  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) is to assist 
landowners in protecting, conserving, and restoring grassland resources 
on private lands through short and long-term rental agreements and 
easements.
    (b) The objectives of GRP are to:
    (1) Emphasize preservation of native and natural grasslands and 
shrublands, first and foremost;
    (2) Protect grasslands and shrublands from the threat of conversion;
    (3) Support grazing operations; and
    (4) Maintain and improve plant and animal biodiversity.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.2  Administration.

    (a) The regulations in this part set forth policies, procedures, and 
requirements for program implementation of the GRP as administered by 
the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service 
Agency (FSA). The regulations in this part will be administered under 
the general supervision and direction of the NRCS Chief and the FSA 
Administrator. These two agency leaders will:
    (1) Concur in the establishment of program policy and direction; 
development of the State allocation formula, and development of broad 
national ranking criteria;
    (2) Use a national allocation formula to provide GRP funds to USDA 
State offices that emphasizes support for biodiversity of plants and 
animals, grasslands under the greatest threat of conversion, and grazing 
operations. The allocation formula will also include a factor 
representing program demand. The demand factor could be expressed in 
terms of applications received, acres offered, funding needs for such 
applications, or a combination of these elements. The allocation formula 
may be modified periodically to change the emphasis of any factor to 
reflect information about natural resource concerns. The data in the 
allocation formula will be updated periodically as new information 
becomes available.
    (3) Ensure the National, State and local level information regarding 
program implementation is made available to the public;
    (4) Consult with USDA leaders at the State level and other Federal 
agencies with the appropriate expertise and information when evaluating 
program policies and direction; and
    (5) Authorize NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive 
Directors to determine how funds will be used and how the program will 
be implemented at the State level.
    (b) At the State level, the NRCS State Conservationist and the FSA 
State Executive Director are jointly responsible to:
    (1) Identify State priorities for project selection, based on input 
from the State Technical Committee;
    (2) Identify, as appropriate, USDA employees at the field level 
responsible

[[Page 401]]

for implementing the program, and the implementation process considering 
the nature and extent of natural resource concerns throughout the State 
and the availability of human resources to assist with activities 
related to program enrollment;
    (3) Develop program outreach materials at the State and local level 
to ensure landowners, operators, and tenants of eligible land are aware 
and informed that they may be eligible for the program;
    (4) Develop conservation practice cost-share rates;
    (5) Administer and enforce the terms of easements and rental 
agreements unless this responsibility is delegated to a third party as 
provided in Sec. 1415.17; and
    (6) With advice from the State Technical Committee, develop criteria 
for ranking eligible land, consistent with national criteria and program 
objectives and address related policy matters regarding program 
direction for GRP in the applicable State. USDA, at the State level, has 
the authority to accept or reject the State Technical Committee 
recommendations; however, USDA will give consideration to the State 
Technical Committee's recommendations.
    (c) The funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation are available to NRCS and FSA to implement GRP.
    (d) Subject to funding availability, the program may be implemented 
in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American 
Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
    (e) The Secretary may modify or waive a provision of this part if he 
or she deems the application of that provision to a particular limited 
situation to be inappropriate and inconsistent with the environmental 
and cost-efficiency goals of GRP. This authority cannot be further 
delegated. No provision of this part which is required by applicable law 
may be waived.
    (f) No delegation in this part to lower organizational levels shall 
preclude the Chief, NRCS, or the Administrator, FSA, from determining 
any issue arising under this part or from reversing or modifying any 
determination arising from this part.
    (g) The Chief, NRCS, may delegate at any time Federal easement 
administration and enforcement responsibilities to approved State 
Agencies, or approved private conservation or land trust organizations 
with the consent or at the request of the participating landowner. The 
USDA Forest Service may hold easements on properties adjacent to USDA 
Forest Service land, with the consent of the landowner.
    (h) Program participation is voluntary.
    (i) Applications for participation will be accepted on a continual 
basis at local USDA Service Centers. NRCS and FSA at the State level 
will establish cut-off periods to rank and select applications. These 
cut-off periods will be available in program outreach material provided 
by the local USDA Service Center. Once funding levels have been 
exhausted, eligible applications will remain on file until additional 
funding becomes available or the applicant chooses to be removed from 
consideration.
    (j) The services of other third parties as provided for in 7 CFR 
part 652 may be used to provide technical services to participants.

(NRCS) or the person delegated authority to act for the Chief.
    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a Government-owned and 
operated entity that was created to stabilize, support, and protect farm 
income and prices. CCC is managed by a Board of Directors, subject to 
the general supervision and direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, 
who is an ex-officio director and chairperson of the Board. The Chief 
and Administrator are Vice Presidents of CCC. CCC provides the funding 
for GRP, and FSA and NRCS administer the GRP on its behalf.
    Conservation District means any district or unit of State, tribal, 
or local

[[Page 402]]

government formed under State, tribal, or territorial law for the 
express purpose of developing and carrying out a local soil and water 
conservation program. Such district or unit of government may be 
referred to as a ``conservation district,'' ``soil conservation 
district,'' ``resource conservation district,'' ``land conservation 
committee,'' or similar name.
    Conservation plan means a record of the client's decisions and 
supporting information, for treatment of a land unit or water as a 
result of the planning process, that meets NRCS Field Office Technical 
Guide quality criteria for each natural resource (soil, water, air, 
plants, and animals) and takes into account economic and social 
considerations. The plan describes the schedule of operations and 
activities needed to solve identified natural resource problems and take 
advantage of opportunities at a conservation management system level. 
The needs of the client, the resources, Federal, State, and local 
requirements will be met by carrying out the plan.
    Conservation practice means a specified treatment, such as a 
structural or land management practice, that is planned and applied 
according to NRCS standards and specifications.
    Cost-share agreement means the document that specifies the 
obligations and the rights of any person who has been accepted for 
participation in the program.
    Department means United States Department of Agriculture.
    Easement means a conservation easement, which is an interest in land 
defined and delineated in a deed whereby the landowner conveys certain 
rights, title, and interests in a property to the United States for the 
purpose of protecting the grassland and other conservation values of the 
property. Under GRP, the property rights are conveyed in a 
``conservation easement deed.''
    Easement area means the land encumbered by an easement.
    Easement payment means the consideration paid to a landowner for an 
easement conveyed to the United States under the Grassland Reserve 
Program.
    Field office technical guide means the official local NRCS source of 
resource information and interpretations of guidelines, criteria, and 
standards for planning and applying conservation treatments and 
conservation management systems. It contains detailed information for 
the conservation of soil, water, air, plant, and animal resources 
applicable to the local area for which it is prepared.
    Forb means any herbaceous plant other than those in the grass 
family.
    Grantor is the term used for the landowner that is transferring land 
rights to the United States through an easement.
    Grassland means land on which the vegetation is dominated by 
grasses, grass-like plants, shrubs, and forbs. The definition of 
grassland as used in the context of this part includes shrubland, land 
that contains forbs, pastureland, and rangeland.
    Grazing value means the value assigned to the grassland cover by 
USDA.
    Improved pasture means grazing land permanently producing natural 
forage species that receives varying degrees of periodic cultural 
treatment to enhance forage quality and yields and is primarily 
harvested by grazing animals.
    Landowner means a person or persons holding fee title to the land.
    Native means a species that is a part of the original fauna or flora 
of the area.
    Natural means a native or an introduced species that is adapted to 
the ecological site and can perpetuate itself in the community without 
cultural treatment. For the purposes of this part the term ``natural'' 
does not include noxious weeds.
    Participant means a landowner, operator, or tenant who is a party to 
a GRP agreement. The term ``agreement'' in this context refers to GRP 
rental agreements and option to purchase agreements for easements. 
Landowners of land subject to a GRP easement are also considered 
participants regardless of whether such landowner initiated the sale of 
the easement to the Federal Government.
    Pastureland means a land cover/use category of land managed 
primarily for the production of introduced forage plants for grazing 
animals. Pastureland cover may consist of a single species in a pure 
stand, a grass mixture, or a

[[Page 403]]

grass-legume mixture. Management usually consists of cultural 
treatments: fertilization, weed control, reseeding or renovation, and 
control of grazing.
    Permanent easement means an easement that lasts in perpetuity.
    Private land means land that is not owned by a governmental entity.
    Rangeland means a land cover/use category on which the climax or 
potential plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, 
grasslike plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing, 
and introduced forage species that are managed like rangeland. Rangeland 
includes lands re-vegetated naturally or artificially when routine 
management of that vegetation is accomplished mainly through 
manipulation of grazing. This term would include areas where introduced 
hardy and persistent grasses, such as crested wheatgrass, are planted 
and such practices as deferred grazing, burning, chaining, and 
rotational grazing are used, with little or no chemicals or fertilizer 
being applied. Grasslands, savannas, many wetlands, some deserts, and 
tundra are considered to be rangeland. Certain communities of low forbs 
and shrubs, such as mesquite, chaparral, mountain shrub, and pinyon-
juniper, are also included as rangeland.
    Rental agreement means an agreement where the participant will be 
paid annual rental payments for the length of the agreement to maintain 
and/or restore grassland functions and values under the Grassland 
Reserve Program.
    Restoration means implementing any conservation practice 
(vegetative, management, or structural) that improves the values and 
functions of grassland (native and natural plant communities).
    Restoration agreement means an agreement between the program 
participant and the United States Department of Agriculture to restore 
or improve the functions and values of grassland and shrubland.
    Restored grassland means land that is to be converted back to 
grassland or shrubland.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Agriculture.
    Shrubland means land that the dominant plant species is shrubs, 
which are plants that are persistent, have woody stems, a relatively low 
growth habitat, and generally produces several basal shoots instead of a 
single bole.
    Significant decline means a decrease of a species population to such 
an extent that it merits direct intervention to halt further decline, as 
determined by the NRCS State Conservationist in consultation with the 
State Technical Committee.
    Similar function and value means plants that are alike in growth 
habitat, environmental requirements, and provide substantially the same 
ecological benefits.
    State Technical Committee means a committee established by the 
Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture in a State 
pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 3861.
    USDA means the Chief, NRCS, in consultation with the Administrator, 
FSA or the NRCS State Conservationist in consultation with the FSA State 
Executive Director.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.4  Program requirements.

    (a) Only landowners may submit applications for easements. For 
rental agreements, the applicant must provide evidence of control of the 
property for the duration of the rental agreement.
    (b) The easement and rental agreement shall require that the area be 
maintained in accordance with GRP goals and objectives for the duration 
of the term of the easement or rental agreement, including the 
conservation, protection, and restoration of the grassland functions and 
values.
    (c) All participants in GRP will be required to implement a 
conservation plan approved by USDA to preserve the viability of the 
grassland enrolled into the program. The conservation plan will document 
the conservation values, characteristics, current and future use of the 
land, practices that may need to be applied along with a schedule for 
application, and a management plan.
    (d) The easement and rental agreement shall grant USDA or its 
representatives a right of access to the easement and rental agreement 
area.

[[Page 404]]

    (e) Easement participants are required to convey title that is 
acceptable to the United States and provide consent or subordination 
agreements from each holder of a security or other interest in the land. 
The landowner shall warrant that the easement granted the United States 
is superior to the rights of all others, except for exceptions to the 
title that are deemed acceptable by the USDA.
    (f) Easement participants are required to use a standard GRP 
easement developed by the Department. The easement shall grant all 
development rights, title, and interest in the easement area in order to 
protect grassland and other conservation values.
    (g) The program participant must comply with the terms of the 
easement or rental agreement and comply with all terms and conditions of 
any associated restoration agreement.
    (h) Easements and rental agreements will allow the following 
activities:
    (1) Common grazing practices on the land in a manner that are 
consistent with maintaining the viability of natural grass and shrub 
species;
    (2) Haying, mowing, or haying for seed production, except that such 
uses shall have certain restrictions determined appropriate by the NRCS 
State Conservationist to protect, during the nesting season, birds in 
the local area that are in significant decline or are conserved in 
accordance with Federal or State law; and
    (3) Fire rehabilitation and construction of firebreaks, fences 
(excluding corrals), watering facilities, seedbed preparation and 
seeding, and any other facilitating practices, as determined by the USDA 
to protect and restore the grassland functions and values.
    (i) Any activity that would disturb the surface of the land covered 
by the easement is prohibited except for common grazing management 
practices carried out in a manner consistent with maintaining the 
functions and values of grassland common to the local area, including 
fire rehabilitation and construction of firebreaks, construction of 
fences, and restoration practices.
    (j) Contracts may be canceled without penalty or refund if the 
original participant dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise 
unavailable during the contract period.
    (k) Participants may be able to convert rental agreements to an 
easement, providing the easement is for a longer duration than the 
rental agreement, funds are available, and the project meets conditions 
established by the USDA. Land cannot be enrolled in both a rental 
agreement option and an easement enrollment option at the same time. The 
rental agreement shall be deemed terminated the date the easement is 
recorded in the local land records office.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.5  Land eligibility.

    (a) GRP is available on privately owned lands, which include private 
and tribal land. Publicly-owned land is not eligible.
    (b) Land shall be eligible for funding consideration if the NRCS 
State Conservationist determines that the land is:
    (1) Grassland, land that contains forbs, or shrubs (including 
rangeland and pastureland); or
    (2) The land is located in an area that has been historically 
dominated by grassland, forbs, or shrubs; and has potential to provide 
habitat for animal or plant populations of significant ecological value, 
as determined by the State Conservationist in consultation with the 
State Technical Committee and FSA, if the land is;
    (i) Retained in the current use of the land; or
    (ii) Restored to a natural condition.
    (c) Incidental lands, in conjunction with eligible land, may also be 
considered for enrollment to allow for the efficient administration of 
an easement or rental agreement.
    (d) Forty contiguous acres is the minimum acreage that will be 
accepted in the program. However, less than 40 acres may be accepted if 
the USDA, with advice from the State Technical Committee, determines 
that the enrollment of acreage meets the purposes of the program and 
grants a waiver. USDA, at the State level, may also establish a higher 
minimum acreage level. USDA will review any minimum acreage requirement 
to ensure, to the

[[Page 405]]

extent permitted by law, that this requirement does not unfairly 
discriminate against small farmers.
    (e) Land will not be enrolled if the functions and values of the 
grassland are protected under an existing contract or easement. The land 
would become eligible when the existing contract expires or is 
terminated, and the grassland values and functions are no longer 
protected.
    (f) Land on which gas, oil, earth, or other mineral rights 
exploration has been leased or is owned by someone other than the GRP 
applicant may be offered for participation in the program. However, if 
an applicant submits an offer for an easement project, USDA will assess 
the potential impact that the third party rights may have upon the 
grassland resources. USDA reserves the right to deny funding for any 
application where there are exceptions to clear title on any property.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.6  Participant eligibility.

    To be eligible to participate in GRP an applicant:
    (a) Must be a landowner for easement participation or be a landowner 
or have general control of the eligible acreage being offered for rental 
agreement participation;
    (b) Agree to provide such information to USDA that the Department 
deems necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of 
eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation 
purposes;
    (c) Meet the Adjusted Gross Income requirements in 7 CFR part 1400; 
and
    (d) Meet the conservation compliance requirements found in 7 CFR 
part 12.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.7  Application procedures.

    (a) Any owner or operator or tenant of eligible land that meets the 
criteria set forth in Sec. 1415.6 may submit an application through a 
USDA Service Center for participation in the GRP. Applications are 
accepted throughout the year.
    (b) By filing an Application for Participation, the applicant 
consents to a USDA representative entering upon the land offered for 
enrollment for purposes of assessing the grassland functions and values, 
and for other activities that are necessary for the USDA to make an 
offer of enrollment. The applicant will be notified prior to a USDA 
representative entering upon their property.
    (c) Applicants submit applications that identify the duration of the 
easement or rental agreement. Rental agreements may be for 10-years, 15-
years, 20-years, or 30-years; easements may be for 30-years, permanent, 
or for the maximum duration authorized by State law.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.8  Establishing priority for enrollment of properties.

    (a) USDA, at the National level, will provide to USDA offices at the 
State level, broad national guidelines for establishing State specific 
project selection criteria.
    (b) USDA, at the State level, with advice from the State Technical 
Committee, shall establish criteria to evaluate and rank applications 
for easement and rental agreement enrollment following the guidance 
established in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Ranking criteria will emphasize support for:
    (1) Native and natural grassland;
    (2) Protection of grassland from the threat of conversion;
    (3) Support for grazing operations; and
    (4) Maintain and improve plant and animal biodiversity.
    (d) When funding is available, USDA at the State level will 
periodically select for funding the highest ranked applications based on 
applicant and land eligibility and the State-developed ranking criteria.
    (e) States may utilize one or more ranking pools, including a pool 
for special project consideration such as establishing a pool for 
projects that receive restoration funding from non-USDA sources.
    (f) The USDA, with advice from the State Technical Committee, may 
emphasize enrollment of unique grasslands or specific geographic areas 
of the State.
    (g) The FSA State Executive Director and NRCS State Conservationist, 
with advice from the State Technical Committee will select applications 
for funding.

[[Page 406]]

    (h) If available funds are insufficient to accept the highest ranked 
application, and the applicant is not interested in reducing the acres 
offered to match available funding, USDA may select a lower ranked 
application that can be fully funded. Applicants may choose to change 
the duration of the easement or agreement or reduce acreage amount 
offered if the application ranking score is not reduced below that of 
the score of the next available application on the ranking list.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.9  Enrollment of easements and rental agreements.

    (a) Based on the priority ranking, USDA will notify applicants in 
writing of their tentative acceptance into the program for either rental 
agreement or conservation easement options. The participant has fifteen 
calendar days from the date of notification to sign and submit a letter 
of intent to continue. A letter of intent to continue from the applicant 
authorizes USDA to proceed with the enrollment process.
    (b) An offer of tentative acceptance into the program does not bind 
the USDA to acquire an easement or enter into a rental agreement, nor 
does it bind the participant to convey an easement, enter into a rental 
agreement, or agree to restoration activities.
    (c) For easement projects, land is considered enrolled after the 
landowner signs the intent to continue. For rental agreements, land is 
considered enrolled after a GRP contract is approved by USDA.
    (d) USDA will present a contract to the participant, which will 
describe the easement or rental area; the easement terms, or rental 
terms and conditions; and other terms and conditions for participation 
that may be required by CCC.
    (e) For easements, after the contract is executed by USDA and 
participant, USDA will proceed with development of the conservation plan 
and various acquisition activities, which may include conducting a 
survey of the easement, securing necessary subordination agreements, 
procuring title insurance, developing a baseline data report, and 
conducting other activities necessary to record the easement.
    (f) Prior to execution by USDA and the participant of the contract, 
the USDA may withdraw its offer anytime due to lack of available funds, 
title concerns for easements, or other reasons. The offer to the 
participant shall be void if not executed by the participant within the 
time specified in an option to purchase agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.10  Compensation for easements and rental agreements.

    (a) Compensation for easements will be based upon:
    (1) The fair market value of the land less the grassland value of 
the land for permanent easements; and
    (2) Thirty percent of the value determined in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section for 30-year easements or for an easement for the maximum 
duration permitted under State law.
    (b) For 10-, 15-, 20-, and 30-year rental agreements, the 
participant will receive not more than 75 percent of the grazing value 
in an annual payment for the length of the agreement.
    (c) In order to provide for better uniformity among States, the FSA 
Administrator and NRCS Chief may review and adjust, as appropriate, 
State or other geographically based payment rates for rental agreements. 
NRCS State Conservationists may establish easement payment amounts on a 
site specific or geographic area basis.
    (d) Easement or rental agreement payments received by participant 
shall be in addition to, and not affect, the total amount of payments 
that the participant is otherwise eligible to receive under other 
Federal laws.
    (e) For easements, to minimize expenditures on individual appraisals 
and expedite program delivery, USDA may complete a programmatic 
appraisal to establish regional average market values and grazing 
values. The programmatic appraisals would remove the need to conduct 
appraisals on each parcel selected for funding.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.11  Restoration agreements.

    (a) Restoration agreements are only authorized to be used in 
conjunction with easements and rental agreements. NRCS, in consultation 
with the program participant, will determine if the grassland resources 
are adequate to

[[Page 407]]

meet the participant's objectives and the purposes of the program, or if 
a restoration agreement is needed. Such a determination will also be 
subject to the availability of funding. NRCS may condition participation 
in the program upon the execution of a restoration agreement depending 
on the condition of the grassland resources. When the functions and 
values of the grassland are determined adequate by NRCS, a restoration 
agreement will not be required. However, if a restoration agreement is 
required, NRCS will set the terms of the restoration agreement. The 
restoration agreement will identify conservation practices and measures 
necessary to improve the functions and values of the grassland. If the 
functions and values of the grassland decline while the land is subject 
to a GRP easement or rental agreement through no fault of the 
participant, the participant may enter into a restoration agreement at 
that time to improve the functions and values with USDA approval and 
fund availability.
    (b) Eligible restoration practices include land management, 
vegetative, and structural practices and measures that will improve the 
grassland ecological functions and values on native and natural, and 
introduced plant communities. The NRCS State Conservationist, with 
advice from the State Technical Committee and in consultation with FSA, 
will determine the conservation practices, measures, payment rates, and 
cost-share percentages, not to exceed statutory limits, that will be 
available for restoration. A list of eligible practices will be 
available to the public. NRCS working through the local conservation 
district with the program participant will determine the terms of the 
restoration agreement. The conservation district may assist with 
determining eligible practices and approving restoration agreements. 
Restoration agreements will not extend past the date of a rental 
agreement or easement.
    (c) All restoration practices and measures are eligible for cost 
sharing. Payments under GRP may be made to the participant of not more 
than 90 percent for the cost of carrying out conservation practices and 
measures on grassland and shrubland that has never been cultivated, and 
not more than 75 percent on restored grassland and shrubland on land 
that at one time was cultivated.
    (d) Restoration activities are applicable to native and natural 
plant communities. When seeding is determined necessary for restoration, 
USDA will give priority to using native seed. However, when native seed 
is not available, or returning the land to native conditions is 
determined impractical by USDA, plant propagation using species that 
provide similar functions and values may be utilized.
    (e) Cost-shared practices shall be maintained by the participant for 
the life of the practice. The life of the practice shall be consistent 
with other USDA cost shared or easement programs. Failure to maintain 
the practice will be dealt with under the terms of the restoration 
agreement and may involve repayment of the Federal cost-share.
    (f) All conservation practices will be implemented in accordance 
with the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide.
    (g) Technical assistance will be provided by NRCS, or an approved 
third party, as needed by the participant.
    (h) Federal cost sharing shall be adjusted so that the combined cost 
share by Federal and State government or subdivision of a State 
government shall not exceed 100 percent of the total actual cost of the 
restoration. The participant cannot receive cost-share from more than 
one Federal cost-share program for the same conservation practice.
    (i) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by a 
qualified individual approved by the NRCS State Conservationist that an 
eligible practice has been established in compliance with appropriate 
standards and specifications.
    (j) Identified practices may be implemented by the participant or 
other designee. Payments will not be made for practices applied prior to 
submitting an application to participate in the program.
    (k) Cost-share payments will not be made for practices implemented 
or initiated prior to the approval of a rental agreement or easement 
acquisition unless a written waiver is granted by

[[Page 408]]

USDA at the State level prior to installation of the practice.


<R05>
Sec. 1415.12  Modifications to easements and rental agreements.

    (a) After an easement has been recorded, no modification will be 
made to the easement except by mutual agreement with Chief, NRCS, and 
the landowner.
    (b) Easement modifications may only be made by the Chief, NRCS, 
after consulting with the Office of General Counsel. Minor modifications 
may be made by the NRCS State Conservationist in consultation with 
Office of General Counsel. Minor modifications are those that do not 
affect the substance of the conservation easement deed. Such 
modifications include, typographical errors, minor changes in legal 
descriptions as a result of survey or mapping errors, and address 
changes.
    (c) Approved modifications will be made only in an amendment to an 
easement which is duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard 
real estate practices, including requirements for title approval, 
subordination of liens, and recordation.
    (d) The Chief, NRCS, may approve modifications on easements to 
facilitate the practical administration and management of the enrolled 
area so long as the modification will not adversely affect the grassland 
functions and values for which the land was acquired or other terms of 
the easement.
    (e) NRCS State Conservationists may approve modifications for

easement, the private organization must be organized as required by 28 
U.S.C. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or be controlled

agreement to administer the easement, or the landowner submits a request 
in writing to terminate such agreement, the USDA will assume the 
responsibility upon receiving such formal notice from the organization 
or the landowner. Subsequent agreements for easement management with 
other approved private, nonprofit organizations could be entered into at

refunded with interest thereon, as determined appropriate by the 
Department.
    (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, 
fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of payments for 
cost-share practices or easements for the purpose of obtaining a payment 
to which a person would otherwise not be entitled.
    (c) A participant who succeeds to the responsibilities under this 
part shall report in writing to the Department any interest of any kind

agreement and the loan deficiency payment application that must be 
executed by a producer to receive marketing assistance loans and LDP's.
    (b)(1) The basic loan rates, the schedule of premiums and discounts, 
and forms applicable to the marketing assistance and loan deficiency 
payment programs for the commodities specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section are available in Farm Service Agency (FSA) State and county 
offices. The forms for use in these programs will be prescribed by CCC.
    (2) Loan deficiency payments shall be available for unshorn pelts, 
hay and silage.
    (c) Marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments will not

in the producer losing beneficial interest in the commodity before 
repaying the loan and the county committee determined the producer acted 
in good faith, to repay the loan at a rate that is the lesser of the 
loan plus interest; or the alternative repayment rate, as determined 
under Sec. 1421.10, in effect on the date the beneficial interest was 
lost. In cases, where a locked-in repayment rate under Sec. 1421.110

committee that is not in compliance with this part; or
    (3) Require a county committee to not take an action or implement a 
decision that is not under the regulations of this part.

determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize 
State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other 
program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such

marketing assistance loan and loan deficiency payment program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute marketing assistance loan 
and loan deficiency payment applications and related documents only 
under the terms and conditions determined and announced by CCC. Any 
document not executed under such terms and conditions, including any

Sec. 1421.6  Beneficial interest.

    (a)(1) To be eligible to receive marketing assistance loans or loan 
deficiency payments, a producer must have the beneficial interest in the 
commodity that is tendered to CCC for a marketing assistance loan or 
loan deficiency payment. The producer must always have had the 
beneficial interest in the commodity unless, before the

[[Page 416]]

commodity was harvested, sheared or slaughtered in the case of unshorn 
pelts, the producer, and a former producer whom the producer tendering 
the commodity to CCC has succeeded, had such an interest in the 
commodity. Commodities obtained by gift, barter or purchase shall not be 
eligible to be tendered to CCC for marketing assistance loans or loan 
deficiency payments. Heirs who succeed to the beneficial interest of a 
deceased producer or who assume the decedent's obligations under an 
existing marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment shall be 
eligible to receive marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency 
payments whether succession to the commodity occurs before or after 
harvest, shearing or slaughter so long as the heir otherwise complies 
with this part.
    (2) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the commodity if the producer retains control, 
title, and risk of loss in the commodity, including the right to make 
all decisions regarding the tender of such commodity to CCC for 
marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments, including those 
cases where the producer takes either of the actions in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section as follows:
    (i) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, for such commodity 
if all other eligibility requirements are met and the option to purchase 
contains the following:

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title; risk of loss; and beneficial interest in the commodity, as 
specified in 7 CFR 1421.6, shall remain with the producer until the 
buyer exercises this option to purchase the commodity. This option to 
purchase shall expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either 
the producer or the buyer, at the earlier of:
    (1) The maturity of any Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loan that 
is secured by such commodity;
    (2) The date CCC claims title to such commodity; or
    (3) Such other date as provided in this option;

    (ii) Enters into a contract to sell the commodity if the producer 
retains title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the commodity 
and the purchaser pays no advance payment amount or any incentive 
payment amount to enter into such contract to the producer, except as 
provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (3) If marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments are 
made available to producers through an approved CMA under part 1425 of 
this chapter, the beneficial interest in the commodity must always have 
been in the producer-member who delivered the commodity to the CMA or 
its member CMA's, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Commodities delivered to such a CMA shall not be eligible to receive 
marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments if the producer-
member who delivered the commodity does not retain the right to share in 
the proceeds from the marketing of the commodity as provided in part 
1425 of this chapter.
    (b) With respect to wool, mohair, dry peas, lentils and small 
chickpeas produced in the 2002 crop year, producers who lost beneficial 
interest before October 11, 2002 are eligible for a loan deficiency 
payment based on the date the producer lost beneficial interest in the 
applicable commodity.
    (c) For peanuts produced in the 2002 crop year, producers who lost 
beneficial interest in the 2002 crop of peanuts are eligible for a loan 
deficiency payment based on the date the producer lost beneficial 
interest in the applicable commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.7  Requesting marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency 
payments.

    (a) A producer must, unless authorized by CCC, request marketing 
assistance loans and loan deficiency payments at the county office that, 
under part 718 of this title, is responsible for administering programs 
for the farm on which the commodity was produced.
    (b) A marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment may be 
requested in person, by mail or electronic format designated by CCC.

Sec. 1421.8  Eligible quantity.

    (a) With respect to marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency 
payments for:
    (1) Farm-stored commodities, all determinations of weight, and

determined at the time of delivery of the commodity to CCC or at the 
time the loan deficiency payment application is filed for measured 
requests, if applicable or selected for spot-check for certified 
requests.
    (2) Warehouse-stored commodities, all determinations of grade, 
weight and quality, except as otherwise agreed to or required by CCC,

acceptable documentation, under Sec. 1421.106, accompanies the loan or 
LDP request.
    (b)(1) A producer may, before the final date for obtaining a 
marketing assistance loan for a commodity, repledge as collateral for 
securing a marketing assistance loan any commodity that had been 
previously pledged as collateral for a marketing assistance loan, except 
with respect to:
    (i) Commodities that have been acquired with commodity certificate 
exchanges under part 1401 of this chapter;
    (ii) Commodities that have been redeemed at the prevailing world 
market price for rice, or the alternative repayment rate for all other 
commodities, as determined by CCC.
    (iii) Commodities on which a loan deficiency payment has been 
received.
    (2) The commodity repledged as security for the subsequent loan 
shall have the same maturity date, under Sec. 1421.101 as the original 
loan.
    (c)(1) The marketing assistance loan documents shall not be 
presented for disbursement unless the commodity subject to the note and 
security agreement is an eligible harvested commodity, is in existence, 
and is in approved farm or warehouse storage, as determined by CCC. If 
the commodity was not either an eligible commodity, in existence, or in 
approved storage at the time of disbursement, the total amount disbursed 
under the marketing assistance loan and charges plus interest shall be 
refunded promptly by the producer.
    (2) Marketing assistance loans may be disbursed to eligible 
producers who store eligible commodities in unlicensed storage 
facilities only if the producer agrees to redeem the marketing 
assistance loan on the date in which the loan is disbursed with a 
commodity certificate exchange.
    (3) CCC shall limit the total marketing assistance loan quantity for 
a loan disbursement, or loan deficiency payment quantity for a loan 
deficiency payment, based on a subsequent increase in the quantity of an 
eligible commodity by the final loan availability date to 100 percent of 
the outstanding quantity of such marketing assistance loan or loan 
deficiency payment application. A producer may obtain a separate 
marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment before the final 
loan availability date for the commodity for quantities in excess of 100 
percent of such quantity if such quantities are an otherwise eligible 
commodity.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.10  Market rates.

    (a)(1) For the 2002 through 2007 crops of barley, corn, grain 
sorghum, oats, wheat, dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, oilseeds, and 
other crops as designated by CCC, a producer may repay a nonrecourse 
marketing assistance loan at a rate that is the lesser of:
    (i) The marketing assistance loan rate and charges, plus interest 
determined for such crop; or
    (ii) The alternative repayment rate for such crop.
    (2) To the extent practicable, CCC shall determine and announce the 
alternative repayment rate, based upon the market prices at appropriate 
U.S. markets as determined by CCC, to minimize loan forfeitures, 
minimize the Federal Government-owned inventory of the commodities, 
minimize the storage costs incurred by the Federal Government 
domestically and internationally, and minimize discrepancies in 
marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and across county 
boundaries. The alternative repayment rate may be adjusted to reflect 
quality and location for each crop of a commodity as follows:
    (i) On a weekly basis in each county for oilseeds, except soybeans;
    (ii) On a daily basis in each county for barley, corn, grain 
sorghum, oats, soybeans, and wheat; and
    (iii) On a weekly basis nationally for dry peas, lentils and small

    (i) The loan rate and charges interest, plus interest determined for 
such crop; or
    (ii) The alternative repayment rate for such crop.
    (2) To the extent practicable, CCC shall determine and announce 
periodically an alternative repayment rate for peanuts, wool, and mohair 
to minimize loan forfeitures, minimize the Federal Government-owned 
inventory of the commodities, minimize the storage costs incurred by the 
Federal Government domestically and internationally, and minimize 
discrepancies in marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and 
across county boundaries.
    (c)(1) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice shall 
be determined by CCC based upon a review of prices at which rice is 
being sold in world markets and a weighting of such prices through the 
use of information such as changes in supply and demand of rice, tender 
offers, credit concessions, barter sales, government-to-government 
sales, special processing costs for coatings or premixes, and other 
relevant price indicators, and shall be expressed in U.S. equivalent 
values F.O.B. vessel, U.S. port of export, per hundredweight as follows:
    (i) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, long grain milled 
rice;

[[Page 419]]

    (ii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, medium grain milled 
rice; and
    (iii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, short grain milled 
rice.
    (2) Export transactions involving rice and all other related market 
information will be monitored on a continuous basis. Relevant 
information may be obtained for this purpose from USDA field reports, 
international organizations, public or private research entities, 
international rice brokers, and other sources of reliable information.
    (3) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice adjusted 
to U.S. quality and location the adjusted world price (AWP), as 
determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, shall apply to this 
section.
    (4) The adjusted world price for each class of rice shall equal the 
prevailing world market price for a class of rice (U.S. equivalent 
value) as determined under paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section and 
adjusted to U.S. quality and location as follows:
    (i) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice shall be 
adjusted to reflect an F.O.B. mill position by deducting from such 
calculated price an amount that is equal to the estimated national 
average costs associated with:
    (A) The use of bags for the export of U.S. rice, and
    (B) The transfer of such rice from a mill location to F.O.B. vessel 
at the U.S. port of export with such costs including, but not limited 
to, freight, unloading, wharfage, insurance, inspection, fumigation, 
stevedoring, interest, banking charges, storage, and administrative 
costs.
    (ii) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section 
shall be adjusted to reflect the market value of the total quantity of 
whole kernels contained in milled rice by deducting the world value of 
broken kernels it contains, with the value of the broken kernels 
determined by multiplying the quantity of broken kernels (4 percent per 
hundredweight) by the world market value of broken kernels. The world 
market value of broken kernels shall be based upon the relationship of 
whole and broken kernel world prices as estimated from observations of 
prices at which rice is being sold in world markets.
    (iii) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section shall be adjusted to reflect the per-pound market value of whole 
kernels by dividing the price by the quantity of whole milled kernels 
contained in the milled rice (96 percent per hundredweight).
    (iv) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section shall be adjusted to reflect the market value of whole kernels 
contained in 100 pounds of rough rice by multiplying such price by the 
estimated national average quantity of whole kernel rice by class 
obtained from milling 100 pounds of rough rice.
    (v) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section 
shall be adjusted to reflect the total market value of rough rice by:
    (A) Adding to such price:
    (1) The market value of bran contained in the rough rice, computed 
by multiplying the domestic unit market value of bran by the estimated 
national average quantity of bran produced in milling 100 pounds of 
rice; and
    (2) The market value of broken kernels contained in the rough rice, 
computed by multiplying the estimated world market value of broken 
kernels by the estimated national average quantity of broken kernels 
produced in milling 100 pounds of rice;
    (B) Deducting from such price:
    (1) An estimated cost of milling rough rice; and
    (2) An estimated cost of transporting rough rice from farm to mill 
locations.
    (vi) The price determined under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section 
may be adjusted to a whole kernel loan rate basis by deducting the 
estimated world market value of the total quantity of broken kernels 
contained in such rice and dividing the resulting value by the estimated 
national average quantity of milled whole kernels produced in milling 
100 pounds of rice.
    (5)(i) The adjusted world price for each class for rice, loan rate 
basis, shall be determined by CCC and announced, to the extent 
practicable, on or after 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time each Tuesday, 
or more frequently, as determined necessary by CCC, continuing through 
the later of:
    (A) The last Tuesday of July 2007; or

[[Page 420]]

    (B) The last Tuesday of the latest month the 2007-crop rice loans 
mature.
    (ii) In the event that Tuesday is a non-workday, the determination 
will be made on the next workday, on or after 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard 
time.
    (iii) The announced prices will be effective upon announcement and 
will remain in effect for a period as announced by the CCC.
    (6) On the day of the announcement of the adjusted world price, 
applications for loan deficiency payments for rice that specify the 
payment rate will not be accepted between 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard 
time and the time of the world price announcement.

    (1) Certify the quantity of such commodity on the loan application, 
or;
    (2) Have such quantity measured by CCC at the measurement service 
rate established by CCC.
    (b) The State committee may establish a marketing assistance loan 
percentage not to exceed a percentage CCC establishes or it may apply 
quality discounts to the loan rate in each year for each commodity on a 
Statewide basis or for specified areas within the State. Before 
approving a county committee request to establish a different loan 
percentage, or to apply quality discounts, the State committee shall 
consider conditions in the State or areas within a State to determine if 
the marketing assistance loan percentage should be reduced below the 
maximum marketing assistance loan percentage or the quality discounts 
should be applied to the basic county marketing assistance loan rate to 
provide CCC with adequate protection. Marketing assistance loans 
disbursed based upon loan percentages previously lowered and loan rates 
adjusted for quality shall not be altered if conditions within the State 
or areas within the State change to substantiate removing such 
reductions. Percentages established or loan rates adjusted for quality 
under this section shall apply only to new marketing assistance loans 
and not to outstanding marketing assistance loans. In determining loan 
percentages or the necessity to apply quality discounts, the State 
committee shall consider any factor at its discretion, including the 
following:
    (1) General crop conditions;
    (2) Factors affecting quality peculiar to an area within the State; 
and
    (3) Climatic conditions affecting storability.
    (c) An eligible quantity of a commodity that is commingled with an 
ineligible quantity of the commodity is not eligible to be collateral 
for a marketing assistance loan unless the producer, when requesting a 
marketing assistance loan designates all structures that may be used for 
storage of the marketing assistance loan collateral.
    (1) In such cases, the producer is not required to obtain prior 
written approval from the county committee before moving marketing 
assistance loan collateral from one designated structure to another 
designated structure.

[[Page 423]]

    (2) In all other instances, if the producer intends to move 
marketing assistance loan collateral from a designated structure to 
another undesignated structure, the producer must request prior approval 
from the county committee. Such approval shall be written and the 
eligible or ineligible commodity must be measured by a representative of 
the county office, at the producer's expense, before commingling. Prior 
to commingling, with respect to wool and mohair, a representative of the 
county committee may determine an average production of the wool and 
mohair in a manner approved by CCC.
    (d)(1) Two or more producers may obtain:
    (i) A single joint marketing assistance loan for commodities that 
are stored in the same farm storage facility; or
    (ii) Individual marketing assistance loans for their share of the 
commodity that is commingled in a farm storage facility with commodities 
owned by other producers if such other producers execute an agreement 
that provides that such producers shall obtain the permission of a 
representative of the county committee before removal of any quantity of 
the commodity from the storage facility. All producers who store a 
commodity in a farm storage facility in which commodities that have been 
pledged as collateral for a marketing assistance loan shall be liable 
for any damage incurred by CCC for the deterioration or unauthorized 
removal or disposition of such commodities.
    (2) In such cases, each producer must execute a note and security 
agreement with CCC, and each such producer shall be jointly and 
severally liable for the violation of the terms and conditions of the 
note and the requirements of this part. Each producer is also liable for 
repayment of the entire marketing assistance loan amount until the 
marketing assistance loan is fully repaid without regard to their share 
in the commodity pledged as collateral. In addition, such producer may 
not amend the note and security agreement for the producer's claimed 
share in such commodities, or marketing assistance loan proceeds, after 
execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.
    (e)(1) A producer, when requesting a marketing assistance loan, 
shall designate in writing specific storage structures.
    (2) The producer is not required to request prior approval before 
moving marketing assistance loan collateral between such designated 
structures.
    (3) Movement of marketing assistance loan collateral to any other 
structures not designated or the disposal of such loan collateral 
without prior written approval of the county committee, shall subject 
the producer to administrative actions.
    (4) The producer is responsible for any loss in quantity or quality 
of the farm-stored commodity pledged as collateral.
    (5) CCC shall not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the 
marketing assistance loan collateral for farm-stored loans.

Sec. 1421.106  Warehouse-stored marketing assistance loan collateral.

    (a) A commodity may be pledged as collateral for a warehouse-stored 
marketing assistance loan in the quantity delivered to CCC for storage 
at a warehouse that meets standards for approval at part 1423 of this 
chapter. Such quantity shall be the net weight specified on the 
warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate.
    (b) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint marketing 
assistance loan for commodities stored in an approved warehouse if the 
warehouse receipt pledged as collateral is issued jointly to the 
producers.
    (c) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
with CCC, each such producer shall be jointly and severally liable for 
the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and the 
regulations in this part. Each such producer shall also remain liable 
for repayment of the entire marketing assistance loan amount until the 
marketing assistance loan is fully repaid without regard to such 
producer's claimed share in the commodity pledged as collateral for the 
marketing assistance loan. In addition, such producer may not amend the 
note and security agreement with respect to

[[Page 424]]

the producer's claimed share in such commodities, or marketing 
assistance loan proceeds, after execution of the note and security 
agreement by CCC.
    (d) Handling and storage rates that CCC has approved to be deducted 
from marketing assistance loan proceeds are available in USDA State and 
county FSA service centers. Deductions shall be based upon entries on 
the warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate, but the storage rate 
shall not exceed the storage rate CCC has approved. No storage deduction 
shall be made if written evidence acceptable to CCC is submitted 
indicating that:
    (1) Storage charges through the maturity date have been prepaid; or
    (2) The producer has arranged with the warehouse operator for the 
payment of storage charges through the maturity date and the warehouse 
operator enters an endorsement in substantially the following form on 
the warehouse receipt:

    Storage arrangements have been made by the depositor of the 
commodity covered by this receipt through (date through which storage 
has been provided). No lien will be asserted by the warehouse operator 
against CCC or any subsequent holder of the warehouse receipt for the 
storage charges that accrued before the specified date.

    (e) The beginning date to be used for computing storage deductions 
on the commodity stored in an approved warehouse shall be the later of 
the following:
    (1) The date the commodity was received or deposited in the 
warehouse;
    (2) The date the storage charges start; or
    (3) The day following the date through which storage charges have 
been paid.
    (f) For hard red winter and hard red spring wheat tendered to CCC 
and stored in an approved warehouse, producers must obtain official 
protein content determinations or, as CCC determines is acceptable, 
protein content may be determined by mutual agreement between the 
producer and the warehouse operator. Costs of determinations shall not 
be paid by CCC.
    (g) For warehouse-stored peanuts, CCC will pay storage charges and 
in-charges and other fees as determined by CCC, to ensure proper storage 
of CCC loan collateral. The beginning date to be used for computing 
storage deductions on the CCC peanut loan collateral stored in an 
approved warehouse shall be the later of the following:
    (1) The date the commodity was received or deposited in the 
warehouse;
    (2) The date the storage charges start; or
    (3) The day following the date through which storage charges have 
been paid.
    (4) The date all required marketing assistance loan documents are 
received in the county office.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.107  Warehouse receipts.

    (a) Warehouse receipts tendered to CCC under Sec. 1421.3 for 
marketing assistance loans must meet the provisions of this section and 
all other provisions of this part, and CCC program documents.
    (b) Warehouse receipts must be issued in the name of the eligible 
producer or CCC. If issued in the name of the eligible producer, the 
receipt must be properly endorsed on its reverse side certifying that 
the crop is free of encumbrances in order for title to vest in the 
holder. Receipts must be issued by an approved warehouse and must 
represent a commodity that is deemed to be stored commingled. The 
receipts must be negotiable and must represent a commodity that is the 
same quantity and quality as the eligible commodity actually in storage 
in the warehouse of the original deposit.
    (c) If the receipt is issued for a commodity that is owned by the 
warehouse operator either solely, jointly, or in common with others, the 
fact of such ownership shall be stated on the receipt. In States where 
the pledge of warehouse receipts issued by a warehouse operator on the 
warehouse operator's commodity is invalid, the warehouse operator may 
offer the commodity to CCC for a marketing assistance loan if such 
warehouse is licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.
    (d) Each warehouse receipt or accompanying supplemental certificate 
representing a commodity stored in an approved warehouse that has a 
storage agreement with CCC shall indicate that the commodity is insured 
under such

[[Page 425]]

agreement. CCC shall not be responsible for the cost of such insurance.
    (e) A separate warehouse receipt must be submitted for each grade 
and class of any commodity tendered to CCC and, for rice, such receipt 
must also state the milling yield of the rice, and for wool, such 
receipts must also state the yield and micron of the wool.
    (f) With respect to peanuts, a warehouse receipt must be submitted 
exhibiting grade, type, and segregation for peanuts tendered to CCC.
    (g)(1) Each warehouse receipt, or a supplemental certificate (in 
duplicate) that properly identifies the warehouse receipt, must be 
issued under the applicable CCC storage agreement or the U.S. Warehouse 
Act, as applicable, and must indicate:
    (i) The name and location of the storing warehouse;
    (ii) The warehouse code assigned by CCC;
    (iii) The warehouse receipt number;
    (iv) The date the receipt was issued;
    (v) The type of commodity;
    (vi) The date the commodity was deposited or received;
    (vii) The date to which storage has been paid or the storage start 
date;
    (viii) Whether the commodity was received by rail, truck or barge;
    (ix) The amount per bushel, pound, or hundredweight of prepaid in or 
out charges;
    (x) The signature of the warehouse operator or the authorized agent; 
and
    (xi) For warehouses operating under a merged warehouse code 
agreement (KC-385), the location and county to which the producer 
delivered the commodity.
    (2) In addition to the information specified in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, additional commodity specific requirements shall be 
determined by CCC and be available at State and county offices and the 
Kansas City Commodity Office.
    (h) If a warehouse receipt indicates that the commodity tendered for 
loan grades ``infested'' or ``contains excess moisture'', or both, the 
receipt must be accompanied by a supplemental certificate in order for 
the commodity to be eligible for a marketing assistance loan. The grade, 
grading factors, and quantity to be delivered must be shown on the 
certificate as follows:
    (1) When the warehouse receipt shows ``infested'' and the commodity 
has been conditioned to correct the infested condition, the supplemental 
certificate must show the same grade without the ``infested'' 
designation and the same grading factors and quantity as shown on the 
warehouse receipt.
    (2)(i) When the warehouse receipt shows that the commodity contained 
excess moisture and the commodity has been dried or blended, the 
supplemental certificate must show the grade, grading factors, and 
quantity after drying or blending of the commodity. Such entries shall 
reflect a drying or blending shrinkage as provided in paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (ii) When a supplemental certificate is issued under paragraphs 
(g)(1) and (g)(2)(i) of this section, the grade, grading factors and the 
quantity shown on such certificate shall supersede the entries for such 
items on the warehouse receipt.
    (iii) If the commodity has been dried or blended to reduce the 
moisture content, the quantity specified on the warehouse receipt or the 
supplemental certificate shall represent the quantity after drying or 
blending.
    (iv) For commodities dried or blended under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of 
this section, such quantity shall reflect a minimum shrinkage in the 
receiving weight excluding dockage:
    (A) For the following commodities, 1.3 times the percentage 
difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and 
the following percentages for the specified commodity:
    (1) Barley: 14.5 percent;
    (2) Corn: 15.5 percent;
    (3) Grain sorghum: 14.0 percent;
    (4) Oats: 14.0 percent;
    (5) Rice: 14.0 percent;
    (6) Soybeans: 14.0 percent;
    (7) Wheat: 13.5 percen; and
    (8) Peanuts: 10.0 percent.
    (B) For the following commodities, 1.1 times the percentage 
difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and 
the following percentages for the specified commodity:
    (1) Canola: 10.0 percent;
    (2) Flaxseed: 9.0 percent;

[[Page 426]]

    (3) Mustard Seed: 10.0 percent;
    (4) Rapeseed: 10.0 percent;
    (5) Safflower Seed: 10.0 percent;
    (6) Sunflower Seed: 10.0 percent;
    (7) Crambe: 10.0 percent; and
    (8) Sesame Seed: 10.0 percent.
    (i)(1) If, under paragraph (g) of this section, a supplemental 
certificate is issued in connection with a warehouse receipt, such 
certificate must state that no lien for processing will be asserted by 
the warehouse operator against CCC or any subsequent holder of such 
receipt.
    (2) Warehouse receipts and the commodities represented by such 
receipts that are stored in an approved warehouse that is operating 
under a CCC storage agreement may be subject to a lien for warehouse 
charges as specified in the applicable storage agreement. For all 
commodities except peanuts, the producer who pledged such a receipt as 
collateral for a loan under this part shall pay to CCC all costs 
incurred by CCC as result of the existence of the lien. In no event 
shall a warehouse operator be entitled to satisfy such a lien by sale of 
the commodities when CCC is the holder of such receipt.
    (j) Warehouse receipts representing commodities that have been 
shipped by rail or by barge, must be accompanied by supplemental 
certificates completed under paragraph (f) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.108  Transfers and reconcentrations.

    (a) Upon request by the producer before transfer, the county 
committee may approve the transfer of a quantity of a commodity that is 
pledged as collateral for a farm-stored loan to a warehouse-stored loan 
at any time during the loan period.
    (1) Liquidation of the farm-stored loan or part thereof shall be 
made through the pledge of warehouse receipts for the commodity placed 
under warehouse-stored loan and the immediate payment by the producer of 
the amount by which the warehouse-stored loan is less than the farm-
stored loan or part thereof and charges plus interest. The loan quantity 
for the warehouse-stored loan cannot exceed 110 percent of the loan 
quantity transferred from the farm-stored loan.
    (2) Any amounts due the producer shall be disbursed by the FSA 
county service center.
    (b) Upon request by the producer before the transfer, the county 
committee may approve the transfer of a warehouse-stored loan or part 
thereof to a farm-stored loan at any time during the marketing 
assistance loan period. Quantities pledged as collateral for a farm-
stored loan shall be based on a measurement or a calculation of average 
production of wool and mohair, such measurement or calculation to be 
made by a representative of the county office before approving the farm-
stored loan. The producer must immediately repay the amount by which the 
farm-stored loan is less than the warehouse-stored loan and charges plus 
interest on the shortage. The maturity date of the farm-stored loan 
shall be the maturity date applicable to the warehouse-stored loan that 
was transferred.
    (c) Upon the filing of the Reconcentration Agreement and Trust 
Receipt by the producer and warehouse operator, CCC may, during the 
marketing assistance loan period, approve the reconcentration in another 
CCC-approved warehouse for all or part of a commodity that is pledged as 
collateral for a warehouse-stored loan. Any such approval shall be 
subject to the terms and conditions in the Reconcentration Agreement and 
Trust Receipt. A producer may, before the new warehouse receipt is 
delivered to CCC, pay to CCC:
    (1) The principal amount of the marketing assistance loan and 
charges plus interest and applicable charges; or
    (2) If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount of 
the marketing assistance loan and charges plus interest under the terms 
and conditions specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the 
commodity pledged as collateral for such marketing assistance loan.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.109  Personal liability of the producer.

    (a) When a producer obtains a commodity marketing assistance loan, 
the producer agrees, in writing, not to:
    (1) Provide an incorrect certification of the quantity or make any 
fraudulent

[[Page 427]]

or erroneous representation for the marketing assistance loan; or
    (2) Remove or dispose of a quantity of commodity that is collateral 
for a CCC farm-stored loan without prior written approval from CCC.
    (3) The violation of the terms and conditions of the note and 
security agreement, will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may 
be disbursed to the producer for a quantity of a commodity that is not 
actually in existence or for a quantity on which the producer is not 
eligible.
    (b) Such violations as are referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section may include:
    (1) Incorrect certification;
    (2) Unauthorized removal; and
    (3) Unauthorized disposition.
    (c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for such violations. 
Accordingly, if the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed such violations, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the 
quantity of the commodity that is involved in the violation.
    (d) In the case of violations, if CCC determines the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the marketing assistance loan rate applicable to 
the loan note for the first offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the marketing assistance loan rate applicable to 
the loan note for the second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the marketing assistance loan rate applicable to the loan 
note.
    (e) For violations and the liquidated damages under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the marketing assistance loan quantity 
removed or disposed of at the lesser of:
    (i) The applicable loan principal, and charges, plus interest, or:
    (ii) The announced alternative repayment rate in effect on date the 
violation occurred, plus 15 percent of the loan rate, or as otherwise 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, and
    (2) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 days from the 
date of notification, accelerate the marketing assistance loan in 
default and require repayment of all loan principal, charges, and 
interest.
    (f) For violations committed and the liquidated damages were 
assessed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the county committee 
shall call the loan involved in the violation, and require repayment of 
the entire loan principal, charges and interest.
    (g) The county committee may waive imposing liquidated damages if it 
determines that the violation was inadvertent, accidental, or 
unintentional.
    (h) If, for any violation, the county committee determines that 
CCC's interest is not or will not be protected, the county committee 
shall call all of the producer's farm-stored loans, and deny future 
farm-stored loans and loan deficiency payments without production 
evidence for 24 months after the date the violation is discovered. 
Depending on the severity of the violation, the county committee may 
deny future farm-stored loans and loan deficiency payments without 
production evidence for an additional period CCC designates.
    (i) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation, the county committee shall notify the producer in 
writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken.
    (j) If the loan is accelerated, the producer may not repay the loan 
at the lower alternative loan repayment rate and may not utilize 
commodity certificate exchanges, unless authorized by CCC.
    (k) Producers rejected for a farm-stored loan under this section may 
apply for a warehouse-stored loan.

[[Page 428]]

    (l) The loan plus other charges shall be payable to CCC upon demand 
if a producer:
    (1) Makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a marketing 
assistance loan, maintaining, or settling a loan; or
    (2) Disposes or moves the loan collateral without the approval of 
CCC.
    (m) A producer shall be personally liable for damages resulting from 
a commodity delivered to or removed by CCC containing mercurial 
compounds, toxin producing molds, or other substances poisonous or 
harmful to humans or animals or property.
    (n) If the amount disbursed under a marketing assistance loan or in 
settlement thereof, exceeds the amount authorized by this part, the 
producer shall be liable for repayment of such excess and charges, plus 
interest.
    (o) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
marketing assistance loan is less than the amount required under this 
part, the producer shall be personally liable for repayment of the 
amount of such deficiency and charges, plus interest.
    (p) In the case of joint loans or loan deficiency payments, the 
personal liability for the amounts specified in this section shall be 
joint and several on the part of each producer signing the note or loan 
deficiency payment application.
    (q) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed may be waived as 
determined by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.110  Repayments.

    (a) CCC may allow a producer to repay a nonrecourse marketing 
assistance loan at a rate that is the lesser of:
    (1) The loan rate and charges, plus interest determined for a crop; 
or
    (2) The prevailing world market price, as determined by CCC, for 
rice or the alternative repayment rate for all other commodities, as 
determined by CCC.
    (b)(1) On a form prescribed by CCC, a producer may request to lock 
in the applicable repayment rate for a period of:
    (i) 60 calendar days; or
    (ii) not less than 14 calendar days before the maturity date of the 
loan, but not both.
    (2) The request to lock in the applicable repayment rate must be 
received in the FSA county service center that disbursed the loan.
    (3) The repayment rate that is locked in is the rate in effect when 
the request to lock in is approved.
    (4) The repayment rate may be locked in on outstanding farm-stored 
or warehouse-stored loans.
    (5) The repayment rate that is locked in will expire the earlier of:
    (i) 60 calendar days from date of approval, or;
    (ii) 14 calendar days before loan maturity.
    (6) The requests can only be completed one time for a designated 
quantity.
    (7) The requests can be made in person or by facsimile.
    (8) The requests cannot be canceled, terminated, or changed after 
approval.
    (9) The locked-in applicable repayment rate will not transfer to any 
loan disbursed outside of the originating county where the commodity was 
stored.
    (10) Once a repayment rate is locked in it cannot be extended.
    (c) If a producer fails to repay a marketing assistance loan within 
the time prescribed by CCC under the terms and conditions of the request 
to lock in a market loan repayment rate, the producer may repay the 
loan:
    (1) On or before maturity, at the lesser of:
    (i) Principal plus interest as determined by CCC;
    (ii) The repayment rate in effect on the day the repayment is 
received in the FSA county service center.
    (2) After maturity at principal plus interest.
    (d) When the proceeds of the sale of the commodity are needed to

obtain prior written approval on a CCC approved form and comply with the 
terms and conditions of such form, to remove a specified quantity of the 
commodity

[[Page 429]]

from storage. Approval does not constitute release of CCC's security 
interest in the commodity or release of producer liability for amounts 
due CCC for the marketing assistance loan indebtedness if payment in 
full is not received by the county office. Failure to repay a marketing 
assistance loan within the time period prescribed by CCC in the case of 
a farm-stored loan and delivery of the pledged collateral to a buyer, is 
a violation of the agreement. In the case of such violation, the 
producer must repay the loan principal and interest or another amount as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, FSA, under Sec. 1421.109.
    (e) The producer may obtain county committee approval of a release 
of all or part of pledged collateral for a warehouse-stored loan at or 
before the maturity of such loan by paying to CCC:
    (1) The principal amount of the marketing assistance loan and 
charges plus interest, or
    (2) An amount less than the principal amount of the marketing 
assistance loan and charges plus interest under the terms and conditions 
specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the collateral for 
such loan.
    (f) A partial release of marketing assistance loan collateral must 
cover all of the commodity represented by one warehouse receipt. 
Warehouse receipts redeemed by repayment of the marketing assistance 
loan shall be released only to the producer. However, such receipt may 
be released to persons designated in a written authorization that is 
filed with the county office by the producer within 15 days before the 
date of repayment.
    (g) The note and security agreement shall not be released until the 
marketing assistance loan has been satisfied in full.
    (h)(1) If the commodity is moved from storage without obtaining 
prior approval to move such commodity, such removal shall constitute 
unauthorized removal or disposition, as applicable under Sec. 
1421.109(b), unless the removal occurred on a non-workday and the 
producer notified the county office on the next workday of such removal.
    (2) Any loan quantities involved in a violation of Sec. 1421.109 
must be repaid under Sec. 1421.109(e).


<R05>

    (a) For any outstanding marketing assistance loan, a producer may 
purchase a commodity certificate and exchange that commodity certificate 
for the marketing assistance loan collateral.
    (b) The exchange rate is the lessor of:
    (1) The loan rate and charges, plus interest applicable to the loan;
    (2) The prevailing world market price, as determined by CCC, for 
rice or the alternative repayment rate for all other commodities, as 
determined by CCC.
    (c) Commodity certificate exchanges may not be used when locking in 
a repayment rate under Sec. 1421.110.
    (d) Producers must request a commodity certificate exchange in 
person at the FSA county service center that disbursed the marketing 
assistance loan by:
    (1) Completing a written request as CCC determines.
    (2) Purchasing a commodity certificate for the exact amount required 
to exchange the marketing assistance loan collateral.
    (3) Immediately exchanging the purchased commodity certificate for 
the outstanding loan collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.112  Loan settlement.

    (a) The value of the settlement of marketing assistance loan shall 
be made by CCC on the following basis:
    (1) For nonrecourse marketing assistance loans, the schedule of 
premiums and discounts for the commodity provided that:
    (i) If, the value of the collateral at settlement is less than the 
amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency 
and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or
    (ii) If, the value of the collateral at settlement is greater than 
the amount due, such excess shall be retained by CCC and CCC shall have 
no obligation to pay such amount to any party.
    (2) For recourse marketing assistance loans, the proceeds from the 
sale of the commodity provided that:

[[Page 430]]

    (i) If, the value of the collateral at settlement is less than the

and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or
    (ii) If, the proceeds received from the sale of the commodity are 
greater than the sum of the amount due, plus any cost incurred by CCC in 
conducting the sale of the commodity, the amount of such excess shall be 
paid to the producer or, if applicable, to a secured creditor of the 
producer.
    (3) If CCC sells the commodity described in paragraphs (a)(1) or 
(a)(2) of this section in settlement of the marketing assistance loan, 
the sales proceeds shall be applied to the amount owed CCC by the 
producer. The producer shall be responsible for any costs incurred by 
CCC in completing the sale. CCC may deduct such amount from the sales 
proceeds.
    (b) Settlements made by CCC for eligible commodities that are 
acquired by CCC and that are stored in an approved warehouse shall be 
made on the basis of the entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, 
supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents.
    (c) Settlements made by CCC for peanuts acquired by CCC and stored 
in an approved warehouse shall be based on the settlement value at the 
time of the loan disbursement and the entries in the applicable 
warehouse receipt, supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents 
subject to adjustments for changes in quality and other factors.
    (1) All eligible commodities that are stored in other than approved 
warehouses shall be delivered to CCC as CCC instructs. Settlement shall 
be based on entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, supplemental 
certificate, and accompanying documents.
    (2) For eligible loan commodities that are delivered from other than 
an approved warehouse, settlement shall be made by CCC on the basis of 
the basic marketing assistance loan rate that is in effect for the 
commodity at the producer's customary delivery point, as determined by 
CCC.
    (d) In all cases, settlements may be adjusted for changes in quality 
and other factors affecting the value of the commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.113  Foreclosure.

    (a)(1) Upon maturity and nonpayment of a warehouse-stored loan, 
title to the unredeemed collateral securing the marketing assistance 
loan shall immediately vest in CCC.
    (2) Upon maturity and nonpayment of a farm-stored marketing 
assistance loan, title to the unredeemed collateral shall automatically 
transfer to CCC upon CCC demand.
    (3) When CCC acquires title to the unredeemed collateral, CCC shall 
not pay for any market value that such collateral may have in excess of 
the marketing assistance loan indebtedness, (the unpaid amount of the 
note and charges plus interest).
    (b) If the total amount due on a farm-stored loan (the unpaid amount 
of the note plus charges, and interest) is not satisfied upon maturity, 
CCC may remove the commodity from storage, and assign, transfer, and 
deliver the commodity or documents evidencing title thereto when, how, 
and upon terms as CCC determines. Disposition may also be effected 
without removing the commodity from storage. The commodity may be 
processed before sale and CCC may become the purchaser of the whole or 
any part of the commodity at either a public or private sale.
    (1) The value of settlement for a farm-stored commodity removed by 
CCC from storage and shall be as provided in Sec. 1421.112.
    (2) If a deficiency exists after the collateral is sold, a claim for 
such deficiency will be established in accordance with part 1403 of this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.115  Recourse marketing assistance loans.

    Source: 67 FR 63511, Oct. 11, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.200  Applicability.

    (a) During the loan availability period, loan deficiency payments 
will be made available to eligible producers when the alternative 
repayment rate is less than the applicable county loan rate.
    (b) To be eligible to receive loan deficiency payments a producer 
must:
    (1) Comply with all marketing assistance loan eligibility including 
beneficial interest requirements.
    (2) Agree to forgo obtaining such loan, if applicable; and
    (3) File in person, by mail or electronically a request for payment 
on a form prescribed by CCC; and
    (4) Otherwise comply with all program requirements.
    (c) A producer must submit a completed request for:
    (1) A field direct loan deficiency payment to CCC on or before the 
date of harvesting or shearing a quantity of an eligible commodity, 
provided further that the producer must have beneficial interest in such 
quantity on the date the commodity is harvested or sheared.
    (2) A field direct loan deficiency payment to CCC for unshorn pelts 
on or before the date of slaughter of the quantity of live lambs, before 
the loss by the producer of beneficial interest in the lamb and the 
unshorn pelt produced from such lamb.
    (3) All other types of loan deficiency payment requests after 
harvest or shearing and before beneficial interest is lost in the 
commodity, but not later than the loan availability date.
    (d) For unshorn pelts, the lamb must be owned for a period of not 
less than 30 days in advance of the application and sold for immediate 
slaughter or slaughtered for personal use. Producers must submit 
acceptable production evidence to CCC under Sec. 1421.12 at the time of 
request. Producers who do not sell lambs for immediate slaughter are 
ineligible for a loan deficiency payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.201  Loan deficiency payment rate.

    (a) The loan deficiency payment rate for a crop shall be the amount 
by which the loan rate for the crop exceeds the rate at which CCC has 
announced that producers may repay their loans under Sec. 1421.10.
    (b) Such rate shall be the amount determined:
    (1) For loan deficiency payments other than field direct:
    (i) On the day the producer submits a completed request for a loan 
deficiency payment to the FSA county service center;
    (ii) Using the rate in effect for the FSA county service center 
where the commodity is stored.
    (2) For field direct loan deficiency payments:
    (i) On the date the commodity was delivered to the processor, buyer, 
warehouse or CMA;
    (ii) Using the rate in effect for the FSA county service center 
where the farm records are kept.
    (3) For rice loan deficiency payments, the adjusted world price 
under Sec. 1421.10(c).
    (c) The loan deficiency payment applicable to such crop shall be 
computed by multiplying the loan deficiency payment rate, as determined 
under paragraph (b) of this section, by the quantity of the crop the 
producer is eligible to pledge as collateral for a nonrecourse loan for 
which the loan deficiency payment is requested.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.202  Loan deficiency payment quantity.

    (a) A loan deficiency payment may be based on 100 percent of the net 
eligible quantity specified on acceptable evidence of production of the 
commodity certified as eligible for loan deficiency payment if such 
production evidence is provided for such commodity under Sec. 1421.12.
    (b) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint loan deficiency 
payment for commodities that are stored in the same storage facility. 
Two or more producers may obtain individual loan deficiency payments for 
their share of the commodity that is stored commingled in a farm storage 
facility

[[Page 432]]

with commodities for which a loan deficiency payment has been requested 
and shall be liable for any damage incurred by CCC for incorrect 
certification of such commodities under Sec. 1421.203.
    (c) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint loan deficiency 
payment for commodities that are stored in an approved or unapproved 
warehouse if the acceptable documentation representing an eligible 
commodity for which a loan deficiency payment is requested is completed 
jointly for such producers.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.203  Personal liability of the producer.

    (a) When a producer requests a loan deficiency payment, the producer 
agrees:
    (1) When signing the Loan Deficiency Payment Application and 
Certification or the Direct Loan Deficiency Payment Agreement, as 
applicable, that the producer will not provide an incorrect 
certification of the quantity or make any fraudulent representation for 
loan deficiency payment purpose; and
    (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of the loan 
deficiency payment request, as applicable, will cause harm or damage to 
CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the producer for a quantity of a 
commodity that is not actually in existence or for a quantity on which 
the producer is not eligible, if CCC determines that the producer has 
violated the terms and conditions of the applicable forms prescribed by 
CCC, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of the 
commodity that is involved in the violation.
    (b) If CCC determines that the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan deficiency payment rate for the first 
offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan deficiency payment rate for the second 
offense.
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the loan deficiency payment rate.
    (c) For violations to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
applies, the producer must repay the loan deficiency payment applicable 
to the loan deficiency quantity incorrectly certified, and charges, plus 
interest applicable to the amount repaid. If the producer fails to pay 
such amounts within 30 days from the date of notification, the producer 
must repay the entire loan deficiency payment and charges plus interest.
    (d) For violations to which paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
applies, the producer shall repay of the entire loan deficiency payment 
and charges plus interest.
    (e) CCC may waive the liquidated damages taken applicable to 
paragraph (b) of this section if the CCC determines that the violation 
occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or unintentionally.
    (f) If, for any violation to which paragraph (b) of this section 
applies, the county committee determines that CCC's interest is not or 
will not be protected, the county committee shall:
    (1) Call the producer's farm-stored loans;
    (2) Deny future farm-stored loans for the current and 2 following 
crop years;
    (3) Deny loan deficiency payments for the current and 2 following 
crop years unless production evidence is presented to CCC. Depending on 
the severity of the violation, the county committee may deny future 
farm-stored loan and loan deficiency payments without production 
evidence.
    (g) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation, the county committee shall notify the producer in 
writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative action will be taken under this section.
    (h) If the amount disbursed under loan deficiency payments exceeds 
the amount authorized by this part, the producer shall be liable for 
repayment

[[Page 433]]

of such excess and charges, plus interest.
    (i) In the case of joint loan deficiency payments, the personal 
liability for the amounts specified in this section shall be joint and 
several on the part of each producer signing the loan deficiency payment 
application.
    (j) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section may be waived as determined 
by CCC.

modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (DAFP), FSA, may 
authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines and 
other program requirements in cases where timeliness or failure to meet 
such other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the 
program. In addition, DAFP may establish other conditions for payments 
that will assist in achieving the goals of the program and may include 
such provisions in the program agreement or other program documents.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.303  Eligible producer and eligible land.

    (a) To be an eligible producer for a payment under this subpart, the 
person must be a producer of wheat, barley, oats, or triticale in the 
2002 through 2007 crop years. Also, to be an eligible producer, the 
person must meet all other qualifications for payment that are set out 
in this subpart, set out in parts 12, 718, 1400, and 1405 of this title. 
A person will not be considered the producer of the crop unless that 
person was responsible for the planting of the crop and had the risk of 
loss in the crop at all times, including, at the time of planting and 
the time of the request for a payment under, this subpart.
    (b) A minor may participate in the program if the right of majority 
has been conferred on the minor by court order or by statute, or if the 
minor participates through a guardian authorized to act on the minor's 
behalf in these matters. Alternatively, a minor may participate if the 
program documents are all signed by an acceptable (to CCC) guarantor or 
if bond, acceptable to CCC, is provided by a surety.
    (c) For the crop to be eligible, the crop, in addition to other 
standards that may apply, must be grown on land that is classified as 
``cropland'' in FSA farm records or on land that FSA determines has been 
cropped in the last 3 years except that the land may also qualify if the 
land is committed to a crop rotation, normal for the locality, that 
includes harvesting the subject crop for grain. These rules are designed 
to assure, to the extent practicable, the available payment did not 
produce plantings that otherwise would not have occurred and the CCC may 
deny payments in any instance in which there is reason to believe that 
the planting was done for that purpose. To that end, if the commodity 
involved has not been previously grown by the producer or is not one 
which is not predominately produced locally, the producer must submit 
evidence of seed purchases for planting the commodities and other 
evidence deemed needed or appropriate by the COC in order to assure that 
the program goals are made and that the land was not planted to an 
eligible commodity simply to obtain a payment. Also, the land to be 
eligible must, for the year involved, be grazed and cannot, during the 
crop year, be harvested at any time for any purpose, except as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator to accommodate producers with a 
history of double-cropping when the crop to be harvested is not the crop 
for which a payment is to be made under this subpart. Land will be 
considered grazed only to the extent that the crop on the land is 
consumed in the field as live plants by livestock for the normal period 
of time for grazing in the area.
    (d)(1) A producer must, at the time of the agreement made under this 
part to obtain a payment, meet all other eligible criteria for obtaining 
loan deficiency payments.
    (2) For producers of triticale who obtain a payment under this 
subpart the producer must enter into an agreement with CCC to forgo any 
harvesting of triticale on the acreage for which such a payment is made.
    (e)(1) No payment will be made if the crop could not have been 
harvested because of weather conditions or any other reason.
    (2) The producer must retain the control, title and risk of loss in 
the commodity for which the payment is sought from the date of planting 
through the date on which mechanical harvesting of the crop would 
normally occur.
    (f) Producers who elect to graze 2002-2007 crop wheat, barley, oats, 
or triticale will not be eligible for an indemnity under the Federal 
Crop Insurance Program provision of Chapter IV of this title or a 
payment under Noninsured Crop Assistance Program authorized under part 
1437 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.304  Time and method for application.

    Application for the program provided in this subpart must be 
received, at the county office that is responsible for administering 
programs for the farm, no earlier than the date on which eligible crops 
would normally be harvested and no later than the final loan 
availability date as determined in accordance with

[[Page 435]]

Sec. 1421.5. The application must describe the land to be grazed and, 
in accordance with standards set by CCC, the tract/field location. The 
COC will determine the first harvest date which shall take into account 
the date on which such crops are, locally, normally harvested for any 
purpose. Where multiple producers are involved, the form must reflect 
each producer's share in the crop. No producer must receive payments 
under this subpart except to the extent that the payments are 
commensurate with that share. Should a person who is entitled to receive 
a payment under this subpart die, that payment, as earned, may be made 
to other persons as provided for in the rules set out in part 707. Third 
parties may also receive payments to the extent provided for in that 
part for other situations involving an incapacitation of the producer. 
Refusals to allow CCC to verify information on any form or report 
utilized for this subpart can result in program ineligibility and 
producers must provide CCC and its agent to the property involved and to 
all records as may be relevant to the making of payments under this 
subpart. Further, false statements will disqualify the producer from the 
program and may be subject to other sanctions including criminal 
sanctions.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.305  Payment amount.

    (a) The grazing payment rate shall be the loan deficiency payment in 
effect for the farm on the date which the producer submits a complete 
program application to CCC. For triticale, the loan deficiency payment 
rate will be equal to the rate for the predominant class of wheat in the 
county where the farm is located in effect as of the date of the 
application is filed.
    (b) The payable units of production shall be computed by multiplying 
the eligible grazed acres by the applicable yield determined under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The payment yield shall be the yield in effect for the 
calculation of direct payments under part 1412 of this chapter. In a 
case of a farm for which a farm program payment yield is unavailable for 
a covered commodity, an appropriate payment yield for the covered 
commodity on the farm will be determined by CCC taking into 
consideration the farm program payment yields applicable to the 
commodity using three (3) similar farms. For triticale, the payment 
yield shall be the yield for wheat from three (3) similar farms in that 
county.
    (d) No payment may be received or retained under this subpart to the 
extent that the payment, were they considered to be LDP's, would place 
that person over the per person per year payment limit that applies to 
LDP's. The producer agrees that the CCC may collect any payment 
considered to be an overpayment by reason of this subsection by 
withholding LDP payments until the matter is resolved, by treating the 
LDP as being not payable to the extent that a grazing refund would 
otherwise be due , by setoff, or by any other means available to CCC.
    (e) Payments can be withheld until the actual grazed acreage is 
verified and justified in connection with any other reports filed with 
FSA with respect to the farm (or filed with some other person or agency) 
and until all other necessary information is obtained. The CCC may 
require such other verification as it deems appropriate to assure that 
the program goals are met.
    (f) To receive the payment, the eligible producer must submit a 
request for payment on an application form as prescribed by CCC or FSA. 
The application may be obtained from the county FSA office, or from the 
USDA or FSA web site in the Internet. The form must be submitted to the 
county by the close of business on or before March 31 of the applicable 
crop year.
    (g) The producer will ineligible for payments under this subpart if 
any discrepancies between the reported acreage on the program form and 
other reports of acreage by the producer are not resolved by a date set 
by the CCC.
    (h) Unless otherwise authorized by the Deputy Administrator, all 
payment shall be made no later than September 28, 2001.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.306  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A producer shall be ineligible to receive payments under this 
subpart if it is determined by DAFP, the State committee, or the county 
committee to have:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device which tends to defeat the purpose 
of this program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this subpart to a producer 
engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, or to any other 
person as a result of the producer's actions, shall be refunded with 
interest together with such other sums as may become due. Any producer 
engaged in acts prohibited by this section and any person receiving 
payment under this subpart, as a result of such acts, shall be jointly 
and severally liable for any refund due under this section and for 
related charges. The remedies provided in this subpart shall be in 
addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies which may 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.307  Refunds; joint and several liability.

    (a) In the event there is a failure to comply with any term, 
requirement, or condition for payment arising under this application, or 
this subpart, and if any refund of a payment to CCC shall become due for 
that or other reason in connection with the application, or this 
subpart, all payments made under this subpart to any producer shall be 
refunded to CCC together with interest as determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section and late-payments charges as provided for 
in part 1402 of this chapter.
    (b) All persons listed on an application shall be jointly and 
severally liable for any refund due in connection with that application 
and for any related charges which may be determined to be due for any 
reason.
    (c) Interest shall be applicable to refunds required of the 
producer. Such interest shall be charged at the rate of interest which 
the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date CCC 
made such benefits available. Such interest shall accrue from the date 
such benefits were made available to the date of repayment but the 
interest rate shall increase to reflect any increase in the rate charged 
to CCC by Treasury for any percent of time for which the interest 
assessment is collected. CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC 
determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to 
any action of the producer.
    (d) Late payment interest shall be assessed on refunds in accordance 
with the provisions of, and subject to the rates in 7 CFR part 1403.
    (e) Producers must refund to CCC any excess payments made by CCC 
with respect to any application in which they have an interest. Such 
refund shall be subject to interest at the same rate that applies to 
other refunds.

Sec. 1421.5551  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the initial or continuing approval by 
the Commodity Credit Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of 
warehouse(s) for the storage and handling of:
    (1) Wheat, oats, corn, rye, barley, sorghums, flaxseed, soybeans, 
sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, safflower, mustard, and such other 
oilseeds as the Secretary may determine under a Uniform Grain Storage 
Agreement (which commodities are hereinafter referred to as ``grain''),
    (2) Rough rice under a Uniform Rice Storage Agreement,
    (3) Milled rice under a Milled Rice Storage Agreement,
    (4) Dry Edible Beans under a Bean Storage Agreement, and

[[Page 437]]

    (5) Seed under a Seed Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or 
held by CCC as security for price support loans.

This subpart is not applicable to grain, rough and milled rice, dry 
edible beans, and seed purchased in store for prompt shipment or to 
handling operations of a temporary nature.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by KCCO and a storage contract or 
agreement must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC 
will use such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering 
into of a storage contract or agreement does not constitute a commitment 
that CCC will use the warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman, when applying for approval under this subpart, 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-24, ``Application for Approval of Warehouse 
for Grain, Rice, Dry Edible Beans, and Seed'', and a completed Form CCC-
24-1, ``Supplement to Application for Approval of Warehouse for Grain, 
Rice, Dry Edible Beans, and Seed'',
    (2) A current financial statement prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles meeting the following 
requirements:
    (i) Each financial statement shall include, but not be limited to 
the following:
    (A) A balance sheet;
    (B) A statement of income (profit and loss);
    (C) Statement of retained earnings; and
    (D) A statement of changes in the financial position.
    (ii) Each financial statement shall be accompanied by one of the 
following:
    (A) A report of audit or review conducted by an independent CPA or 
an independent public accountant in accordance with standards 
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
The accountant's report of audit or review shall include the 
accountant's certifications, assurances, opinions, comments, and notes 
with respect to such financial statement, or
    (B) A compilation report of the financial statement which is 
prepared by a grain commission firm or a management firm if such firm 
has been authorized by the Deputy Vice President, CCC (Deputy 
Administrator, Commodity Operations, FSA) to provide a compilation 
report of financial statements of warehousemen.
    (iii) All financial statements shall be accompanied by a 
certification by the chief executive officer of the warehouseman, under 
penalty of perjury, that the financial statement(s) accurately reflects 
the financial condition of the warehouseman for the period specified in 
such statement.
    (iv) A current financial statement on Form WA-51-2, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51-2 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.
    (v) Only one financial statement is required for a chain of 
warehouses owned or operated by a single business entity. If approved by 
the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee, the financial statement 
of a parent company, which includes the financial position of a wholly-
owned subsidiary, may be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for 
the wholly-owned subsidiary.
    (3) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1421.5552(a)(2) and such 
other documents or information as CCC may require.
    (e) The provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall also be 
applicable to warehousemen who have an existing storage contract with 
CCC. Such warehousemen with existing storage contracts shall submit 
their financial statements to CCC in the manner prescribed reflecting 
their financial condition as of the close of the warehouseman's fiscal 
or calendar

[[Page 438]]

year's operation, whichever is applicable. Thereafter, the financial 
statements and the audit, review or compilation reports shall be 
furnished annually to reflect the warehouseman's fiscal or calendar 
year's operation, whichever is applicable, and at such other times as 
may be required by the AMS or CCC.

Sec. 1421.5552  Basic standards.

    Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, each warehouseman and 
each of the warehouses owned or operated by such warehouseman for which 
CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC owned or loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for 
hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a 
corporation, shall be authorized by its charter to engage in such 
business,
    (2) Have a current and valid license for the kind of storage 
operation for which the warehouseman seeks approval if such a license is 
required by State or local laws or regulations,
    (3) Have a net worth which is the greater of $50,000 or an amount 
which is computed by multiplying the maximum storage capacity of the 
warehouse (the total quantity of the commodity which the warehouseman 
desires to store and which the warehouse can accommodate when stored in

hundredweight in the case of rough rice, eighty-five (85) cents per 
hundredweight in the case of milled rice, and sixty (60) cents per 
hundredweight in the case of dry edible beans. In the case of seed, the 
net worth of the warehouseman shall be at least equal to an amount which 
is computed by multiplying the estimated number of pounds of seed to be 
stored times seven (7) cents per pound. If this calculated net worth 
requirement exceeds $50,000, the warehouseman may satisfy any deficiency 
in net worth between the $50,000 minimum requirement and such calculated 
net worth requirement by furnishing bonds, irrevocable letters of 
credit, or other acceptable substitute security meeting the requirements 
of Sec. 1421.5553.

Storage Agreement, Bean Storage Agreement, or Seed Storage Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the load out capacity 
of any warehouse at a single location need not exceed the equivalent of 
200 railroad cars per day.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall have the 
necessary experience, organization, technical qualifications, and skills 
in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodities to 
enable them to provide proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials, and each of the supervisory employees 
of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall:

Sec. 1421.5553  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process in the State where the warehouse is located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC,
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than ninety (90) days or 
includes a rider providing for not less than ninety (90) days' notice to 
CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a substitute bond for one 
warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC against insufficient 
bond coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage contract or agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.5554  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage or handling of commodities and periodically thereafter 
to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.5555  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart:
    (a) The financial, bond, and original and periodic warehouse 
examination provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman 
approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of 
commodities under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under the 
U.S. Warehouse Act for such commodities but a special examination shall 
be made of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is 
necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $50,000 but who 
fails or whose warehouse fails to meet one

[[Page 440]]

or more of the other standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity, and
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.5556  Approval of warehouses, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart, and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. The notice will state the cause(s) for such action. Unless 
the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1421.5552, other than the standard set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after 
receiving notice of such action, request reconsideration of the action 
and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of 
such request. The Director shall consider such information in making a 
determination and notify the warehouseman in writing of such 
determination. The warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's 
determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal 
hearing thereon by filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as 
``FSA''). The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, 
nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the 
hearing shall be as prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 
7 CFR part 780. When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman 
shall be considered as a ``participant''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1421.5552(c)(2), the ware house man's administrative 
appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in 
accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period 
of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

Sec. 1421.5557  Exemption from requirements.

    If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of the subpart and no reasonable and economic alternative is 
available for securing such services for commodities under CCC programs, 
the President or Executive Vice President, CCC, may temporarily exempt, 
in writing, applicants for storage agreements and warehousemen who are 
currently under contract with CCC in such area from one or more of the 
standards of this subpart and may establish such other standards as are 
considered necessary to satisfactorily safeguard the interests of CCC.

Sec. 1421.5558  Contract and application and inspection fees.

    (a) Each warehouseman who has a non-federally licensed grain or rice 
warehouse in States that do not have a Cooperative Agreement with CCC 
for warehouse examinations must pay an annual contract fee to CCC for 
each such warehouse which is approved by CCC or for which CCC approval 
is sought as follows:

[[Page 441]]

    (1) A warehouseman who has an existing agreement with CCC for the 
storage or handling of CCC-owned commodities or commodities pledged to 
CCC as loan collateral must pay an annual contract fee for each 
warehouse approved under that agreement in advance of the renewal date 
of such agreement.
    (2) All grain and rice warehousemen who do not have an existing 
agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned commodities 
or commodities pledged to CCC as loan collateral but who desire such an 
agreement must pay an application and inspection fee for each warehouse 
for which CCC approval is sought prior to CCC conducting the original 
warehouse examination. The annual contract fee must be paid by the 
warehouseman to CCC prior to the time that the agreement is entered 
into.
    (3) The contract fee will be prorated based upon the total number of 
months for which the contract is to be effective.
    (4) CCC may, upon the request of a warehouseman, conduct an 
examination of a warehouse for the sole benefit of the warehouseman and 
such warehouseman shall pay to CCC a fee equal to 1\1/2\ times the 
amount of the warehouseman's annual contract fee for such examination.
    (b) Any subsequent changes in the contract and application fees 
shall be announced in the Federal Register.

 Subpart_Standards for Approval of Dry and Cold Storage Warehouses for 
   Processed Agricultural Commodities, Extracted Honey, and Bulk Oils

    Source: 44 FR 67081, Nov. 23, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1423.1  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the approval by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of warehouse(s) for the 
storage and handling of:
    (1) Dry or refrigerated processed agricultural commodities under a 
Processed Commodities Storage Agreement (hereinafter referred to as 
``processed commodities''),
    (2) Bulk oils, under a Contract or Agreement for Tank Storage, which 
are owned by CCC or held by CCC as collateral for price support loans, 
and
    (3) Extracted Honey (hereinafter referred to as ``honey'') under a 
Honey Storage Agreement, either in bulk or in containers meeting 
specifications in the applicable honey price support regulations, which 
is owned by CCC or held by CCC as security for price support loans. This 
subpart shall not apply

[[Page 442]]

to processed commodities, extracted honey, and bulk oils purchased in 
store by CCC for prompt shipment or to handling of commodities.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by KCCO and a storage contract or 
agreement must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC 
will use such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering 
into of a storage contract or agreement does not constitute a commitment 
that CCC will use the warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman when applying for approval under this subpart, 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-560, ``Application for Approval of 
Warehouse (Processed Commodities)'', or Form CCC-513, ``Application for 
Approval of Tank Farm'', or Form CCC-55, ``Application for Approval of 
Warehouse for Honey Storage Contract'', whichever is applicable,
    (2) A current financial statement on Form WA-51, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee. 
Financial statements shall show the financial condition of the 
warehouseman as of a date no earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the 
date of the warehouseman's application, or such other date as CCC may 
prescribe. Additional financial statements shall be furnished annually 
and at such other times as CCC may require. CCC also may require that 
financial statements prepared by the warehouseman or by a public 
accountant be examined by an independent certified public accountant in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Only one 
financial statement is required for a chain of warehouses owned or 
operated by a single business entity. If approved by the Director, KCCO, 
or the Director's designee, the financial statement of a parent company, 
which includes the financial position of a wholly-owned subsidiary, may 
be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for the wholly-owned 
subsidiary.
    (3) Copies of the warehouseman's tariff and any changes thereto, and
    (4) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1423.2(a)(2) and such other 
documents or information as CCC may require.

<R05>
Sec. 1423.2  Basic standards.

    Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, each warehouseman and 
each of the warehouses owned or operated by such warehouseman for which 
CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC-owned or loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for 
hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a 
corporation, shall be authorized by its charter to engage in such 
business.
    (2) Have a current and valid license for the kind of storage 
operation for which the warehouseman seeks approval if such a license is 
required by State or local laws or regulations.
    (3) Have a net worth which is the greater of $25,000 or (i) for 
dairy and other processed commodities (other than those shown in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the amount which results from 
multiplying five (5) percent of the current purchase price, times the 
quantity of the commodity to be stored; (ii) for honey, sugar and bulk 
oils, the amount which results from multiplying the storage capacity of 
the flat warehouse space available to CCC or the maximum capacity of the 
bulk tank(s), whichever is applicable, times five (5) percent of the 
current loan value for honey and sugar and five (5) percent of the 
current market value for

[[Page 443]]

bulk oils. The net worth need not exceed $250,000. If the calculated net 
worth exceeds $25,000, the warehouseman may satisfy any deficiency in 
net worth between the $25,000 minimum requirement and such calculated 
net worth by furnishing bonds (or acceptable substitute security) 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 1423.3,
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating 
expenses,
    (5) Have satisfactory corrected, upon request by CCC, any 
deficiencies in the performance of any storage contract or agreement 
with CCC,
    (6) Use only warehouse receipts or such other documents as CCC may 
prescribe,
    (7) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,
    (8) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable 
firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored 
commodity, and
    (9) Have a work force and equipment available to complete loadout as 
stated below or as CCC may prescribe:
    (i) Forty-five (45) working days of the total quantity of all honey 
and processed commodities stored for CCC.
    (ii) Seventy-five (75) working days of that quantity of bulk oils 
for which the warehouse is or may be approved under a contract with CCC.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall have the 
necessary experience, organization technical qualifications, and skills 
in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodity to enable 
them to provide proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials, and each of the supervisory employees 
of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall:
    (1) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and 
performance, and
    (2) Be neither suspended nor debarred under applicable CCC 
suspension and debarment regulations.
    (d) The warehouse shall:
    (1) Be of sound construction, in good state of repair, and 
adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the 
applicable commodity,
    (2) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all 
times. If a warehouse is leased by the warehouseman, a copy of the 
written lease agreement must be furnished to CCC at the time the 
warehouseman applies for approval under this subpart. The lease 
agreement must be renewable and must provide that the lessor cannot 
cancel the agreement without giving at least 120 days notice to the 
warehouseman. All leases are subject to approval by the CCC Contracting 
Officer, and
    (3) Not be subject to greater than normal risk of fire, flood or 
other hazards.

Sec. 1423.3  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process in the State where the warehouse is located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC.
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than one hundred twenty (120)

against insufficient bond coverage on other warehouses.

[[Page 444]]

    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage contract or agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

Sec. 1423.4  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart a warehouse must be

<R05>
Sec. 1423.6  Approval of warehouse, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart; and

warehouseman. The notice will state the cause(s) for such action. Unless 
the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1423.2, other than the standard set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after receiving notice 
of such action, request reconsideration of the action

[[Page 445]]

and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of 
such request. The Director shall consider such information in making a 
determination and notify the warehouseman in writing of such 
determination. The warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's 
determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal 
hearing thereon by filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as 
``FSA''). The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, 
nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the

shall be considered as a ``participant'''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1423.2(c)(2), the ware house man's administrative 
appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in 
accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period 
of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for

or more of the standards of this subpart and may establish such other 
standards as are considered necessary to safeguard satisfactorily the 
interests of CCC.

    (2) For biodiesel production, the factor that will treat 1.4 gallons 
of biodiesel produced as having involved the consumption of one bushel 
of soybeans in any case when the feedstock was an eligible commodity 
that has a corresponding oil or grease market price; if there is none, 
then the factor shall be as determined and announced by CCC.
    Eligible commodity means barley; corn; grain sorghum; oats; rice; 
wheat; soybeans; cotton seed; sunflower seed; canola; crambe; rapeseed; 
safflower; sesame seed; flaxseed; mustard seed; cellulosic crops, such

<R05>
Sec. 1424.4  General eligibility rules.

    (a) An applicant must be determined eligible by KCCO and be assigned 
an agreement number.
    (b) To be eligible for program payments, a producer must maintain 
records indicating for all relevant FY's and FY quarters:
    (1) The use of eligible commodities in bioenergy production;
    (2) The quantity of bioenergy produced from an eligible commodity by 
location;
    (3) The quantity of eligible commodity used by location to produce 
the bioenergy referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and
    (4) All other records, needed, or required by the agreement to 
establish program eligibility and compliance.
    (c) A producer must allow verification by CCC of all information 
provided. Refusal to allow CCC or any other agency of USDA to verify any 
information provided will result in a producer being determined not 
eligible.
    (d) For producers not purchasing raw commodity inputs, the 
production must equal or exceed that amount of production that would be 
calculated using the raw commodity inputs and the conversion factor set 
out in Sec. 1424.3. A producer that purchases soy oil from a soybean 
crushing plant for further refinement into biodiesel must be able to 
prove to CCC's satisfaction both soy oil purchases and biodiesel 
production for the applicable quarter. Any special conversion factors 
needed will be the province of CCC and CCC alone and CCC's decision will 
be final.
    (e) A producer must meet all other conditions set out in these 
regulations, in the agreement, or in other program documents.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.5  Agreement process.

    (a) To participate, an eligible producer must submit a signed 
agreement during the FY sign-up period. Agreements may be for single or 
multiple FY's. However, multiple FY agreements require producers to 
submit annual production estimate reports during each applicable FY 
sign-up period. Such reports must comply with the terms of the agreement 
and this part. In all cases, the accounting for compliance will be made 
on a per FY basis.
    (b) Sign-up each FY will be held for 30 calendar days beginning for:
    (1) FY 2003 on the date of publication of this rule;
    (2) FY 2004 and beyond on August 1 of the FY before the applicable 
FY.
    (c) After agreements are submitted:
    (1) If determined eligible by KCCO, an agreement number will be 
assigned, and a notification will be mailed to the producer;
    (2) If additional information is needed for KCCO to determine 
eligibility, the producer will be contacted as soon as practicable and 
requested to provide additional supporting documentation;
    (3) If determined ineligible by KCCO, producers will be notified in 
writing that their agreement was rejected and the reason for the 
determination.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.6  Payment application process.

    (a) To apply for payments under this program during an FY, an 
eligible producer must:
    (1) Submit an application or eligibility report for each quarter. 
Submit the last quarterly application or report of the FY within 30 
calendar days of the end of the FY for which payment is requested. If 
the actual deadline is a non-workday, the deadline will be the next 
business day;
    (2) Certify with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of the 
information provided;
    (3) Furnish CCC such certification, and access to such records, as 
CCC considers necessary to verify compliance with program provisions; 
and
    (4) Provide documentation as requested by CCC of both the producer's 
net purchases of eligible commodities and net production of bioenergy 
compared to such production at all locations during the relevant 
periods. CCC may adjust the formulaic payments otherwise payable to the 
producer if there is a difference between the amount actually used and 
certified and the amount of increased commodity use calculated under the 
formula.

[[Page 448]]

    (b) After applications or reports are submitted, eligible producers:
    (1) Shall submit such additional supporting documentation as 
requested by KCCO when additional information is needed to determine 
eligibility;
    (2) Will be notified in writing of their ineligibility and reason 
for the determination, when the application is determined ineligible by 
KCCO; and
    (3) Shall promptly refund payments when a refund to CCC is due. If a 
refund is not made promptly, CCC may establish a claim.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.7  Gross payable units.

    (a) For ethanol, producers will be eligible for payments on gross 
payable units for only their ethanol production from eligible inputs 
that exceeds, for the program year to date, their total comparable 
production at all locations as compared to the comparable portion of the 
previous year. Producers of ethanol are not eligible for base production 
payments. Producers shall not be paid twice for the same increase and 
any decline in relative production between quarters will require a 
comparable refund. For example, if at the end of the first quarter, a 
producer were to be paid for an increase of 500 gallons of ethanol, but 
at the end of the second quarter, that producer's year-to-date 
production was down to a net increase for the year of 450 gallons, then 
a refund would be due for the loss of the corresponding 50 gallons of 
net extra production. Repayment rates shall be based on previous payment 
rates. Unless otherwise determined by CCC, the extra ethanol production 
from eligible inputs will be converted to gross payable units by 
dividing the gallons of increased ethanol by the applicable conversion 
factor.
    (b) Biodiesel producers will be eligible for payments on gross 
payable units for all biodiesel production from eligible inputs. For 
eligibility purposes there will be two kinds of payment: additional 
production payments (APP), and base production payments (BPP). Repayment 
rates shall be based on previous payment rates. Unless otherwise 
determined by CCC, gross payable units for biodiesel production from 
eligible inputs will be calculated as follows:
    (1) For APP, by dividing the gallons of increased biodiesel by the 
biodiesel conversion factor of 1.4. APP payments will be made on 
increases as compared with the previous FY. Producers will not be paid 
twice for the same production. Failure to maintain year to date 
biodiesel production increases between quarters will require a 
comparable APP refund as specified below. That is, for example, if a 
producer were to be paid, at the end of the first quarter, for 500 
gallons of increased biodiesel production, but by the end of the second 
quarter that producer's production, for the year to date, was only 450 
gallons, then a refund of the APP premium would be due for the loss of 
the corresponding 50 gallons of net production increase.
    (2) For BPP, which will be made on production not eligible for the 
APP, by dividing the base production by the biodiesel conversion factor 
of 1.4 and multiplying the result by 0.5 in FY 2003, 0.3 in FY 2004, 
0.15 in FY 2005, or 0.0 (zero) in FY 2006 to determine base biodiesel 
production gross payable units.
    (3) Adding the APP and BPP to determine biodiesel gross payable 
units.
    (c) There shall only be one eligible producer per plant location.
    (1) When producers move production from one plant to another between 
FY's, the prior FY's production for the producer for program payment 
calculations tied to increases in production shall be the greater of:
    (i) The production at the plant operated by the producer in the 
prior FY, or
    (ii) The production in the prior FY at the plant being taken over by 
the producer in the current FY.
    (2) New producers who are taking over a plant with prior bioenergy 
production shall assume that production history for program purposes. 
For example: in FY 2002, Producer A produced 1,000 gallons of bioenergy 
in plant 1 and Producer B produced 500,000 of bioenergy in plant 2. In 
FY 2003, Producer A assumes operation of plant 2; Producer B moves to 
plant 3, which was not in the program in FY 2002, but with FY 2002 
production of 400,000 gallons from eligible commodities; and Producer C 
assumes operations of plant 1.

[[Page 449]]

In FY 2003, for program purposes solely based on these respective 
plants, Producer A would have a prior FY production of 500,000 gallons; 
Producer B would have a prior FY production of 500,000 gallons; and 
Producer C would have a prior FY production of 1,000 gallons. These 
examples would apply when a producer moves its entire operation from one 
plant to another. Otherwise, for purposes of computing whether a 
producer has increased production in the current year from the previous 
year, the determination will be made by comparing for the current year 
the producer's production figures from all locations in which the 
producer has an interest with, for the previous year, the sum of:
    (i) Production at those locations by any person including, but not 
limited to, the producer, and
    (ii) Additional production by the producer at any other location in 
that year.
    (3) Also, as needed to avoid frustrating the goals of the program, 
the Executive Vice President of CCC may treat producers with common 
interests, common ownership, or common facilities or arrangements as the 
same producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.8  Payment amounts.

    (a) An eligible producer may be paid the amount specified in this 
section, subject to the availability of funds. Total available funds 
shall be as determined appropriate by CCC and shall not exceed $150 
million in any of FY's 2003 through 2006.
    (b) For agreements submitted during an FY sign-up, applicants must 
project increases in production. Based on expected commodity prices, 
using the formula set out in this section, submissions will be assigned 
an expected payment value. When the payment value of all timely 
submitted and validly executed agreements exceed available funding, CCC 
may, at its discretion, prorate payments to be made under such 
agreements based on total available funding.
    (c) When the payment value of all timely submitted applications 
exceed available funding, CCC will prorate payments based on total 
available funding.
    (d) Subject to this section and conditions in the agreement, a 
producer's payment eligibility shall be adjusted at the end of each 
quarter, and calculated as follows:
    (1) Gross payable units, calculated and determined in accordance 
with Sec. 1424.7, shall be converted to net payable units for producers 
whose annual bioenergy production is:
    (i) Less than 65 million gallons, by dividing by 2.5;
    (ii) Equal to or more than 65 million gallons, by dividing by 3.5;
    (2) Net payable units calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall then be converted to a gross payment by multiplying net 
payable units by the per-unit value of the commodity as of the 10th 
business day before the start of the production quarter, determined as 
follows:
    (i) For ethanol:
    (A) For those agricultural commodities with an established Posted 
County Price, CCC will use the Posted County Price that CCC announces 
daily for the county in which the plant is located and applicable 
quality factors as CCC may establish.
    (B) For agricultural commodities that CCC determines do not have 
Posted County Prices, CCC will use market data CCC determines to be 
appropriate for the applicable commodity.
    (ii) For biodiesel made from:
    (A) Soybeans or soy oil, CCC will use the Posted County Price for 
soybeans for the county where the plant is located.
    (B) Eligible commodities other than soybeans or soy oil that have a 
corresponding oil or grease market price, CCC will first use the 
soybeans Posted County Price for Macon County, Illinois. Then, the 
applicable feedstock's oil or yellow grease (for animal fats and oils) 
market price, as determined by CCC, will be divided by the soy oil price 
published in the Agricultural Marketing Service's weekly ``Soybean Crush 
Report'' (Central Illinois (Decatur, Macon County, Illinois)) for the 
applicable date. The resulting percentage will be multiplied by the 
soybean gross payment to determine the producer's gross payment.

[[Page 450]]

    (C) Eligible commodities that do not have a corresponding oil or 
grease market price, in a manner as determined by CCC.
    (3) The gross payment calculated under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section shall be reduced to a net payment by multiplying the gross 
payment figure by the proration factor determined under paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (4) Subject to other provisions of this section, producers shall be 
paid the net current payment, if positive, determined for the quarter, 
subject to the requirements and refund provisions of this part.
    (5) After the first quarter, adjustments shall be made based on 
changes in production. Refunds, when due, shall be due at the per unit 
values at which they were paid.
    (6) For an FY, no producer may receive more than 5 percent of the 
available funding for this program.
    (e) When the commodity's conversion factor has been established, 
that factor will, as practicable, be posted on the program's website.
    (1) If the commodity's conversion factor is not determined when the 
sign-up is announced, the conversion factor will be provided in a letter 
to producers with accepted agreements to the extent practicable.
    (2) After FY 2003, changes to established conversion factors shall 
be announced in a press release issued by CCC 90 calendar days before 
the applicable FY's sign-up, to the extent practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.9  Reports required.

    Once an eligible producer has submitted a payment application, that 
producer shall file cumulative and per-plant information for each 
relevant bioenergy producing facility quarterly through the end of the 
applicable FY as specified by CCC or as otherwise needed to establish 
compliance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.10  Succession and control of facilities and production.

    A person who obtains a facility that is under contract under this 
part may request permission to succeed to the program agreement and CCC 
may grant such request if it is determined that permitting such 
succession would serve the purposes of the program. If appropriate, CCC 
may require the consent of the original party to such succession. Also, 
CCC may terminate a contract and demand full refund of payments made if 
a contracting party loses control of a facility whose increased 
production is the basis of a program payment or otherwise fails to 
retain the ability to assure that all program obligations and 
requirements will be met.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.11  Maintenance and inspection of records.

    For the purpose of verifying compliance with the requirements of 
this part, each eligible producer shall make available at one place at 
all reasonable times for examination by representatives of USDA, all 
books, papers, records, contracts, scale tickets, settlement sheets, 
invoices, written price quotations, or other documents related to the 
program that is within the control of such entity for not less than 
three years from the payment date.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.12  Appeals.

    (a) A participant subject to an adverse determination under this 
part may appeal by submitting a written request to: Deputy 
Administrator, Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency, United States 
Department of Agriculture, STOP 0550, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, D.C. 20250-0550. The appeal must be delivered in writing to 
the Deputy Administrator or postmarked within 30 days after the date the 
Agency decision is mailed or otherwise provided to the participant. The 
Deputy Administrator may consider a late appeal if determined warranted 
by the circumstances.
    (b) The regulations at 7 CFR part 11 apply to decisions made under 
this part.
    (c) Producers who believe they have been adversely affected by a 
determination by the Agency must seek review with the Deputy 
Administrator before any other review may be requested within the 
Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.13  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A producer shall be ineligible to receive payments under this 
program if CCC determines the producer:

[[Page 451]]

    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program in this part;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this part to a producer engaged 
in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, or to any other person as a 
result of the bioenergy producer's actions, shall be refunded with 
interest together with such other sums as may become due, plus damages 
as may be determined by CCC.
    (c) Any producer or person engaged in an act prohibited by this 
section and any producer or person receiving payment under this part 
shall be jointly and severally liable for any refund due under this part 
and for related charges.
    (d) The remedies provided in this part shall be in addition to other 
civil, criminal, or administrative remedies that may apply.
    (e) Late payment interest shall be assessed on all refunds in 
accordance with the provisions and rates prescribed in part 1403 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1424.14  Offsets, assignments, interestand waivers.

    (a) Any payment or portion thereof to any person shall be made 
without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard 
to any claim or lien against the bioenergy, or proceeds thereof, in 
favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies of the U.S. 
Government. The regulations governing offsets and withholdings found in 
part 1403 of this chapter shall be applicable to agreement payments.
    (b) Any producer entitled to any payment may assign any payments in 
accordance with regulations governing the assignment of payments found 
at part 1404 of this chapter.
    (c) Interest charged by CCC under this part shall be at the rate of 
interest that the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of 
the date CCC made such funds available. Such interest shall accrue from 
the date such payments were made available to the date of repayment or 
the date interest increases as determined in accordance with applicable 
regulations.
    (d) CCC may waive the accrual of interest and/or damages if CCC 
determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to 
any action of the bioenergy producer.

    The marketing agreement between the CMA and its members shall give 
the CMA the authority to pledge the commodity as collateral for a loan,

[[Page 455]]

    (c) A pool shall be eligible for loans and LDP's if:
    (1) All of the commodity in the pool is eligible for loans or LDP's,

grade, quality, bale weight or repacking in the case of cotton, or other 
factors; or

producer has certified to the CMA that the commodity is eligible for 
loan, and there is no market gain or LDP involved in the loan pool for 
the crop year.
    (e) A CMA may, for a period of time as specified in Handbook 1-CMA, 
include a commodity that is ineligible based on FSA records when the 
producer has certified to the CMA the commodity is eligible. In these 
instances, CCC specifies a time period during which CMA's may obtain 
loan or LDP's on the applicable quantity while the eligibility status is 
resolved. If the final resolution is that the commodity was ineligible, 
the CMA must repay any loans outstanding with principal plus interest 
and any market gains obtained plus interest from the date of receiving

agreements or the CMA shall obtain a completed form CCC-679, Lien 
Waiver. When liens are applicable based on CMA financial agreements, the 
CMA shall provide CCC the completed CCC-679. CMA's shall not take any 
action to cause a lien or encumbrance to be placed on a commodity after 
a loan is approved.
    (k) If a loan or LDP is obtained for any quantity in a loan pool, 
allocations of costs and expenses among separate pools for the commodity 
in the pool shall be made according to generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (l) A CMA shall not apply marketing losses from a commodity not used 
to obtain a loan or LDP against the marketing proceeds of a commodity 
used to obtain a loan or LDP.
    (m) CMA's shall not carry forward losses from one loan pool and 
apply them against a subsequent loan pool without CCC's authorization. 
CCC may grant authorization when it determines that carrying forward the 
loss complies with CCC's loan and LDP program intent.
    (n) The CMA is responsible to CCC for any loss related to 
commodities the CMA pledged as collateral for loan or used to obtain LDP 
related to:
    (1) The CMA failing to comply with these regulations;

eligible for loans or LDP's; and
    (iii) Within 15 work days from the date the CMA receives loan or LDP 
proceeds from CCC, except when loans are redeemed within 15 work days of 
the date of the loan.
    (2) CMA's may credit advances to its members made before loans and 
LDP's are obtained against the distribution of loan and LDP proceeds 
requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, loan 
pool proceeds shall not be combined with non-loan pool proceeds and the 
CMA shall distribute loan pool proceeds according to the information it 
provided CCC in accordance with Sec. 1425.4(b)(7).
    (2) Sales proceeds from a loan pool may be combined with sales 
proceeds from other pools if the proceeds from such pools are allocated 
among the pools according to the quantity and quality of the commodity 
included in the pools.
    (3) Loan and LDP proceeds shall only be issued to members involved 
in pools used for loans or LDP's.
    (4) When notified by CCC that loan and LDP distributions to a member

shall be allocated in the following manner until all inventory in a loan 
pool is depleted:

    (2) For commodities that are not processed, the pool's inventory 
shall be allocated to the pool and the pool's inventories adjusted when 
the commodity is shipped.
    (c) Records of loan and non-loan pool dispositions do not have to be

    (a) The regulations of this subpart are applicable to the 2002 
through 2007 crops of upland cotton and extra long staple cotton. These 
regulations set forth the general provisions under which marketing 
assistance loans and loan deficiency payment programs shall be 
administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Additional terms 
and conditions are in the note and security agreement and the loan 
deficiency payment application that must be executed by a producer to 
receive marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments.
    (b) The basic loan rates, the schedule of premiums and discounts, 
and forms applicable to the cotton marketing assistance loan and loan 
deficiency payment programs are available from FSA offices. The forms 
for use in connection with the programs in this subpart shall be 
prescribed by CCC.
    (c) Marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments will not 
be available for any cotton produced on land owned or otherwise in the 
possession of the United States if such land is occupied without the 
consent of the United States.
    (d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, a producer 
may only receive the maximum assistance allowed by part 1400 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Eligible producers, under 7 CFR 1421.4, who produce upland 
cotton during the 2002 through 2007 crop years on a farm that is not 
covered under a direct and counter-cyclical program contract, as defined

loans or loan deficiency payments as are eligible producers who produced 
commodities on farms covered by such a contract.

programs shall be administered under the general supervision of the

FSA employees, and state and county committees.
    (b) No FSA employee or committee may modify or waive any requirement 
in this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) The State committee shall take any required action not taken by 
the county committee. The State committee shall also:
    (1) For the 2001 crop year only, allow producers who, in good faith, 
violated the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement 
resulting in the producer losing beneficial interest in the commodity 
before repaying the loan, to repay the loan at a rate that is the lesser 
of the loan plus interest, or the adjusted world price, as determined 
under Sec. 1427.19, in effect on the date the beneficial interest was 
lost.
    (2) Correct, or require a correction of an action that is not in 
compliance with this part; or
    (3) Stop an employee from taking an action or decision that is not 
in accordance with the regulations of this part.
    (d) The Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee may determine 
any question arising under these programs, and reverse or modify a 
determination made by an FSA employee or State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize 
State or county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other 
program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such 
other program requirements does not adversely affect the operation of 
the marketing assistance and loan deficiency payment programs.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute marketing assistance loan 
and Loan deficiency payment applications and related documents only 
under the terms and conditions determined and announced by CCC. Any 
document not executed under such terms and conditions, including any 
purported execution before the date authorized by CCC, shall be null and 
void.

to CCC has succeeded, had such an interest in the cotton. Cotton 
obtained by gift, barter or purchase shall not be eligible to be 
tendered to CCC for marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency 
payments. Heirs who succeed to the beneficial interest of a deceased 
producer or who assume the decedent's obligations under an existing 
marketing assistance loan shall be eligible to receive marketing 
assistance loans and loan deficiency payments whether succession to the 
cotton occurs before or after harvest so long as the heir otherwise 
complies with this part.
    (2) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the cotton if the producer retains control, 
title, and risk of loss in the cotton, including the right to make all 
decisions regarding the tender of the cotton to CCC for marketing 
assistance loans or loan deficiency payments including those cases where 
the producer:
    (i) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, for such cotton if 
all other eligibility requirements are met and the option to purchase 
contains the following:

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title; risk of loss; and beneficial interest in the commodity, as 
specified in 7 CFR 1427.5, shall remain with the producer until the 
buyer exercises this option to purchase the commodity. This option to 
purchase shall expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either 
the producer or the buyer, at the earlier of: (1) The maturity of any 
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loan which is secured by such 
commodity; (2) the date CCC claims title to such commodity; or (3) such 
other date as provided in this option.

    (ii) Enters into a contract to sell the cotton if the producer 
retains title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the commodity 
and the purchaser pays no advance payment amount or any incentive 
payment amount to enter into such contract, except as provided in part 
1425 of this chapter; or
    (iii) Executes a designation of agent on a form prescribed by CCC. 
Such designation:
    (A) Allows the producer to authorize an agent or subsequent agent to 
redeem all or a portion of the cotton pledged as collateral for a 
marketing assistance loan;
    (B) Identifies the warehouse receipts for which the authorization is 
given;
    (C) Expires upon maturity of the marketing assistance loan;
    (D) Allows agents so designated by the producer to designate a 
subsequent

[[Page 464]]

agent by endorsement of the form by the agent;
    (E) Must be presented at the time the marketing assistance loan is 
repaid at the county office or loan servicing agent where such loan 
originated if the agent or subsequent agent exercises any authority 
granted by the producer, unless the producer provides authorization to 
CCC to use an electronic agent designation as the basis for accepting 
redemption of some or all bales of the specified loan; and
    (F) May be canceled by the producer by providing the custodial 
office a written request signed and dated by the producer showing the 
name of the agent, the loan number, and the bales applicable to the 
Cooperating Ginners' Bagging and Bale Ties Certification and Agreement 
that was provided by the Agency. The effective date of the cancellation 
shall be the date the request is received by the custodial office.
    (3) If marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments are 
made available to producers through a CMA under part 1425 of this 
chapter, the beneficial interest in the cotton must always have been in 
the producer-member who delivered the cotton to the CMA or its member, 
except as otherwise provided in this section. Cotton delivered to such a 
CMA shall not be eligible to receive a marketing assistance loan or a 
loan deficiency payment if the producer-member who delivered the cotton 
does not retain the right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of 
the cotton as provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (f) If the person tendering cotton for a loan or a loan deficiency 
payment is a landowner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper, such cotton 
must represent such person's separate share of the crop and must not 
have been acquired by such person directly or indirectly from a 
landowner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper.
    (g) Each bale of upland cotton sampled by the warehouse operator 
upon initial receipt which has not been sampled by the ginner must not 
show more than one sample hole on each side of the bale. If more than 
one sample is desired when the bale is received by the warehouse 
operator, the sample shall be cut across the width of the bale, broken 
in half or split lengthwise, and otherwise drawn under Agricultural 
Marketing Service (AMS) dimension and weight requirements. This 
requirement will not prohibit sampling of the cotton at a later date if 
authorized by the producer.
    (h) Marketing assistance loans may be disbursed to eligible 
producers who store upland cotton in unlicenced storage facilities only 
if the producer agrees to redeem the marketing assistance loan on the 
date on which the loan is disbursed with a commodity certificate 
exchange.

the time of disbursement, the total amount disbursed under the loan, and 
charges plus interest shall be refunded promptly.


<R05>

    (2) CCC may at any time accelerate the loan maturity date by 
providing the producer notice of such acceleration at least 30 days in 
advance of the accelerated maturity date.
    (b) If the loan is not repaid by the loan maturity date, title to 
the cotton shall vest in CCC the day after such maturity date and CCC 
shall have no obligation to pay for any market value which such cotton 
may have in excess

[[Page 465]]

of the amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.8  Amount of loan.

    (a) The loan rates for crops of upland cotton and ELS cotton will be 
determined and announced by CCC and made available at State and county 
offices.
    (b) The quantity of cotton which may be pledged as collateral for a 
loan shall be the net weight of the eligible cotton as shown on the 
warehouse receipt issued by an approved warehouse, except that in the 
case of a bale which has a net weight of more than 600 pounds, the 
weight to be used in determining the amount of the loan on the bale 
shall be 600 pounds. Cotton pledged as collateral for loans on the basis 
of reweights will not be accepted by CCC.
    (c) The amount of the loan for each bale will be determined by 
multiplying the net weight of the bale, as determined under paragraph 
(b) of this section by the applicable loan rate.
    (d) CCC will not increase the amount of the loan made for any bale 
of cotton as a result of a redetermination of the quantity or quality of 
the bale after it is tendered to CCC, except that if it is established 
to the satisfaction of CCC that a bona fide error was made for the 
weight of the bale or the classification for the bale, such error may be 
corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.9  Classification of cotton.

    (a) References made to ``classification'' in this subpart shall 
include color grade, leaf, staple length, extraneous matter and 
micronaire, and for upland cotton, strength readings. All cotton 
tendered for loan must be classed by an AMS Cotton Classing Office or 
other entity approved by CCC and tendered on the basis of such 
classification.
    (b) An AMS cotton classification or other entity's classification 
acceptable by CCC showing the classification of a bale must be based 
upon a representative sample drawn from the bale under instructions to 
samplers drawing samples under AMS procedures.
    (c) If the producer's cotton has not been classed or sampled in a 
manner acceptable by CCC, the warehouse shall sample such cotton and 
forward the samples to the AMS Cotton Classing Office or other entity 
approved by CCC serving the district in which the cotton is located. 
Such warehouse must be licensed by AMS or be approved by CCC to draw 
samples for submission to the AMS Cotton Classing Office or other entity 
approved by CCC.
    (d) If a sample has been submitted for classification, another 
sample shall not be drawn, except for a review classification.
    (e) Where review classification is not involved, if through error or 
otherwise two or more samples from the same bale are submitted for 
classification, the loan rate shall be based on the classification 
having the lower loan value.
    (f) If a review classification is obtained, the loan value of the 
cotton represented thereby will be based on such review classification.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.10  Approved storage.

69 FR 12056, Mar. 15, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.11  Warehouse receipts.

    (a) Producers may obtain loans on eligible cotton represented by 
warehouse receipts only if the warehouse receipts meet the definition of 
a warehouse receipt and provide for delivery of the cotton to bearer or 
are properly assigned by endorsement in blank, so as to vest title in 
the holder of the receipt or are otherwise acceptable to CCC. The 
warehouse receipt must:
    (1) Contain the gin bale number;
    (2) Contain the warehouse receipt number;
    (3) Be dated on or before the date the producer signs the note and 
security agreement.
    (b) Warehouse receipts, under Sec. 1427.3, when issued as block 
warehouse receipts will be accepted when authorized by CCC only if the 
owner of the warehouse issuing the block warehouse receipt owns the 
cotton represented by the block warehouse receipt and the warehouse is 
not licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.
    (c)(1) Each receipt must set out in its written or printed terms the 
tare and the net weight of the bale represented thereby. The net weight 
shown on the warehouse receipt shall be the difference between the gross 
weight as determined by the warehouse at the warehouse site and the tare 
weight. The warehouse receipt may show the net weight established at a 
gin if:
    (i) The gin is in the immediate vicinity of the warehouse and is 
operated under common ownership with such warehouse or in any other case 
in which the showing of gin weights on the warehouse receipts is 
approved by CCC; and
    (ii) Gin weights are permitted by the licensing authority for the 
warehouse.
    (2) The tare shown on the receipt shall be the tare furnished to the 
warehouse by the ginner or entered by the ginner on the gin bale tag. A 
machine card type warehouse receipt reflecting an alteration in gross, 
tare, or net weight will not be accepted by CCC unless it bears, on the 
face of the receipt, the following legend or similar wording approved by 
CCC, duly executed by the warehouse or an authorized representative of 
the warehouse:

Corrected (gross, tare, or net) weight,
(Name of warehouse),
By (Signature or initials),
Date.

    (3) Alterations in other inserted data on a machine card type 
warehouse receipt must be initialed by an authorized representative of 
the warehouse.
    (d) If warehouse storage charges have been paid, the receipt must 
show that date through which the storage charges have been paid.
    (e) If warehouse receiving charges have been paid or waived, the 
warehouse receipt must show such fact. Except for bales stored in the 
States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Virginia, if receiving charges due on the bale include a charge, if any, 
for a new set of ties for compressing flat bales tied with ties which 
cannot be reused, the warehouse receipt must indicate the receiving 
charges and include a charge for new set of ties. If the bale is stored 
at a warehouse not having compress facilities and bales shipped from the 
warehouse are normally compressed in transit, the warehouse receipt must 
show the bale ties are not suitable for reuse when the bale is 
compressed and charges will be assessed by the nearest compress in line 
of transit for furnishing new bale ties.
    (f) In any case where loan collateral is forfeited, any unpaid 
storage or receiving charges, not to exceed the amount that accrued from

Sec. 1427.16  Reconcentration of cotton.

    (a) CCC may under certain conditions, before loan maturity, 
compress, store, insure, or reinsure the cotton against any risk, or 
otherwise handle or deal with the cotton as it may deem necessary or 
appropriate for the purpose of protecting the interest therein of the 
producer or CCC.
    (b) CCC may reconcentrate the cotton pledged for the marketing 
assistance loan from one CCC-approved warehouse to another with the 
written consent of the producer and upon the request of the local 
warehouse and certification that there is congestion and lack of storage 
facilities in the area. However, if CCC determines such cotton is 
improperly warehoused and subject to damage, or if any of the terms of 
the loan agreement are violated, or if carrying charges are 
substantially in excess of the average of carrying charges available 
elsewhere and the local warehouse, after notice, declines to reduce such 
charges, such written consent need not be obtained.
    (1) An FSA official, the loan servicing agent, or CMA shall arrange 
for reconcentration of the cotton under the direction of CCC and CCC 
shall obtain new warehouse receipts.
    (2) Any reconcentration charges, fees, costs, or expenses incident 
to such actions shall be charged against the cotton, and must be repaid 
for bales redeemed from loan.

Sec. 1427.17  Custodial offices.

    Collateral warehouse receipts, using forms prescribed by CCC, and

<R05>
Sec. 1427.18  Liability of the producer.

    (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in 
obtaining a marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment or in 
maintaining or settling a loan, or disposes of or moves the loan 
collateral without the prior written approval of CCC, such loan or loan 
deficiency payment shall be payable upon demand by CCC. The producer 
shall be liable for:
    (i) The amount of the marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency 
payment;
    (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC for the loan or loan 
deficiency payment;
    (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts;
    (v) Liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (vi) About amounts due for a loan, the payment of such amounts may 
not be satisfied by the forfeiture of loan collateral to CCC of cotton 
with a settlement value that is less than the total of such amounts or 
by repayment of such loan at the lower loan repayment rate as prescribed 
in Sec. 1427.19.
    (2) If a producer makes a fraudulent representation or if the 
producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without prior 
written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral delivered to or 
acquired by CCC shall be equal to the sales price of the cotton less any 
costs incurred by CCC in completing the sale.
    (b) If the amount disbursed under a marketing assistance loan, or in 
settlement thereof, or loan deficiency payment exceeds the amount 
authorized by this subpart, the producer shall be liable for repayment 
of such excess, plus interest. In addition, the commodity pledged as 
collateral for such loan shall not be released to the producer until 
such excess is repaid.
    (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
marketing assistance loan or loan deficiency payment is less than the 
amount required under this subpart, the producer shall be personally 
liable for repayment of the amount of such deficiency plus applicable 
interest.
    (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
or loan deficiency payment application with CCC, each such producer 
shall be jointly and severally liable for the violation of the terms and 
conditions of the note and security agreement or loan deficiency payment 
application and this subpart. Each producer shall also remain liable for 
repayment of the entire loan or loan deficiency payment amount until the 
loan is fully repaid without regard to their share in the cotton pledged 
as collateral for the loan or for which the loan deficiency payment was 
made. In addition, such producer may not amend the note and security 
agreement or loan deficiency payment application for the producer's 
claimed share in such cotton after execution of the note and security 
agreement or loan deficiency payment application by CCC.
    (e) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC if a producer makes 
any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or loan deficiency 
payment or in maintaining or settling a loan or disposing of or moving 
the loan collateral without the prior written approval of CCC. 
Accordingly, if CCC determines that the producer has violated the terms 
or conditions of their requests for a loan or any applicable form 
required by CCC, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of 
the cotton which is involved in the violation. If CCC determines the 
producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the first offense; or

[[Page 470]]

    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than first or second offense, liquidated damages will be assessed 
by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 percent of 
the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the loan deficiency payment 
rate.
    (f) For first and second offenses, if CCC determines that a producer 
acted in good faith when the violation occurred, CCC shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal and charges, plus 
interest applicable to the loan quantity affected by the violation or 
for loan deficiency payment, the loan deficiency payment amount 
applicable to the loan deficiency quantity involved with the violation, 
and charges plus interest from the date the loan deficiency payment was 
made; and
    (2) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section;
    (3) If the producer fails to pay such amounts within 30 calendar 
days from the date of notification, CCC shall call the applicable 
marketing assistance loan involved in the violation and require 
repayment of any market gain previously realized for the applicable 
loan, plus any interest previously waived and any storage paid by CCC, 
or fora loan deficiency payment, require repayment of the loan 
deficiency payment and charges plus interest from the date the loan 
deficiency payment was made.
    (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense 
for which CCC cannot determine good faith when the violation occurred, 
CCC shall:
    (1) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; 
and
    (2) Call the applicable marketing assistance loan involved in the 
violation and require repayment of any market gain previously realized 
for the applicable loan, plus any interest previously waived and any 
storage paid by CCC, and for a loan deficiency payment, require 
repayment of the loan deficiency payment and charges plus interest from 
the date the loan deficiency payment was made.
    (h) If the county committee acting on behalf of CCC determines that 
the producer has committed a violation under paragraph (e) of this 
section, CCC shall notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances which caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken under paragraph (f) or (g) 
of this section.
    (i) If the marketing assistance loan is called under this section, 
the producer must repay the loan at principal and charges, plus interest 
and may not repay the loan at the lower of the loan repayment rate under 
Sec. 1427.19 or utilize the provisions of part 1401 of this chapter for 
such loan.
    (j) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under paragraph 
(e) of this section may be waived as determined by CCC.
    (k)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, for ELS 
cotton stored as provided in Sec. 1427.10(e), the producer shall be 
liable for all costs associated with the storage of the cotton while it 
is stored outside. CCC shall make no storage payment or any other 
payment with respect to ELS cotton stored as provided in Sec. 
1427.10(e).
    (2) The producer of ELS cotton which is stored as provided in Sec. 
1427.10(e) shall:
    (i) Certify the quantity of such cotton on the loan application; 
certify the cotton is packaged in a hermetically sealed bag with an 
internal humidity level established by the gin as appropriate to 
safeguard the cotton; certify that packaging materials meet or exceed 
industry minimum standards; certify that the storage area is suitable 
for cotton storage and is in an area approved by CCC; certify that the 
storage area is constructed to prevent water accumulation under the 
cotton and is outside a 100-year floodplain; and certify that the 
storage area is serviced by bale handling and transport equipment that 
will not damage the sealed bag or degrade the storage area;
    (ii) Be responsible for any loss in quantity or quality of such 
cotton;

[[Page 471]]

    (iii) If the loan is satisfied by forfeiting the cotton to CCC, be 
responsible for all costs associated with delivering such cotton to a 
warehouse designated by CCC, all costs associated with any re-
classification and repackaging that may be required by CCC or the 
warehouse operator to whom the cotton is delivered, all charges by the 
receiving warehouse for receiving the cotton and issuing an electronic 
warehouse receipt for the cotton, and other charges as may be levied by 
the warehouse specific to outside-stored cotton; and
    (iv) Not move such cotton after the loan application is submitted to 
CCC without prior written approval of the county committee. Failure of 
the producer to receive such permission shall subject the producer to 
administrative actions.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.25  Determination of the prevailing world market price and

    (a) CCC shall determine the world market price for upland cotton as 
follows:
    (1) During the period when only one daily price quotation is 
available for each growth quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-
second inch (M 1\3/32\ inch) cotton, C.I.F. (cost, insurance, and 
freight) northern Europe, the prevailing world market price for upland 
cotton shall be based upon the average of the quotations for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the 
growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe.
    (2) During the period when both a price quotation for cotton for 
shipment no later than August/September of the current calendar year 
(current shipment price) and a price quotation for cotton for shipment 
no earlier than October/November of the current calendar year (forward 
shipment price) are available for growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, the prevailing world market price for 
upland cotton shall be based upon the following: Beginning with the 
first week covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes 
April 15 or, if both the average of the current shipment prices for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the 
growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe 
(Northern Europe current price (NEc)), and the average of the forward 
shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 
lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, 
C.I.F. northern Europe (Northern Europe forward price (NEf)), are not 
available during that period, beginning with the first week covering the 
period Friday through Thursday after the week which includes April 15 in 
which both the NEc and NEf price are available, the prevailing world 
market price for upland cotton shall be based upon the result calculated 
by the following procedure:
    (i) Weeks 1 and 2: ((2 x NEc) + NEf)/3.

[[Page 474]]

    (ii) Weeks 3 and 4: (NEc + NEf)/2.
    (iii) Weeks 5 and 6: (NEc + (2 x NEf))/3.
    (iv) Week 7 through July 31: NEf.
    (3) The upland cotton prevailing world market price as determined 
under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section shall hereinafter be 
referred to as the ``Northern Europe price (NE).''
    (4) If quotes are not available for 1 or more days in the 5-day 
period, the available quotes during the period will be used. If no 
quotes are available during the Friday through Thursday period, the 
prevailing world market price shall be based upon the best available 
world price information, as CCC determines.
    (b) The upland cotton prevailing world market price, adjusted under 
paragraph (c) of this section (adjusted world price (AWP)), shall be 
applicable to the 2002 through 2007 crops of upland cotton.
    (c) The upland cotton AWP shall equal the NE price as determined 
under paragraph (a) of this section, adjusted as follows:
    (1) The NE shall be adjusted to average designated U.S. spot market 
location by deducting the average difference in the immediately 
preceding 52-week period between:
    (i)(A) The average of price quotations for the U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted each Thursday 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, during the period 
when only one daily price quotation for such growths is available, or
    (B) The average of the current shipment prices for U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted each Thursday 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, during the period 
when both current shipment prices and forward shipment prices for such 
growths are available; and

crop of the U.S. base quality.
    (3) The price determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
shall be adjusted to average U.S. location by deducting the difference 
between the average loan rate for an upland cotton crop of the U.S. base 
quality in the designated U.S. spot markets and the corresponding crop 
year national average loan rate for an upland cotton crop of the U.S. 
base quality, as CCC announces.
    (4)(i) The prevailing world market price, adjusted under paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, may be further adjusted if it is 
determined that:
    (A) Such price is less than 115 percent of the current crop-year

cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe.
    (ii) During the period when both current shipment prices and forward 
shipment prices are available for growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, the USNE provided in paragraph 
(c)(4)(i)(B) of this section shall be determined as follows: Beginning 
with the week covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes 
April 15 or, if both the average of the current shipment prices for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday of the lowest-priced U.S. growth, as 
quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F.

average of the forward shipment prices for the preceding Friday through 
Thursday of the lowest-priced United States growth quoted for M 1\3/32\ 
inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (U.S. Northern Europe forward price 
(USNEf)), are not available during that period, beginning with the first 
week covering the period Friday through Thursday after the week which 
including April 15 in which both the average of the USNEc and the 
average of the USNEf are available, the result calculated by the 
following procedure:
    (A) Weeks 1 and 2: ((2 x USNEc) + (USNEf))/3.
    (B) Weeks 3 and 4: ((USNEc) + (USNEf))/2.
    (C) Weeks 5 and 6: ((USNEc) + (2 x USNEf))/3.

    (iii) In determining the USNE as provided in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(B) 
and (c)(4)(ii):
    (A) If quotes for either the U.S. Memphis territory or the 
California/Arizona territory are not available for any week, the 
available quotations will be used.
    (B) If quotes are not available for one or more days in the 5-day 
period, the available quotes during the period will be used.
    (C) If no quotes are available for either the U.S. Memphis territory 
or the California/Arizona territory during the Friday through Thursday 
period, no adjustment will be made.
    (iv)(A) The adjustment shall be based on some or all of the 
following data, as available:
    (1) The U.S. share of world exports;
    (2) The current level of cotton export sales and shipments; and
    (3) Other data CCC determines relevant in establishing an accurate 
prevailing world market price, adjusted to U.S. quality and location.
    (B) The adjustment may not exceed the difference between the USNE, 
as determined in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section, and the NE, as determined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) In determining the average difference in the 52-week period as 
provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
    (1) If the difference between the average price quotations for the 
U.S. Memphis territory and the California/Arizona territory, as quoted 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, and the average price 
of M 1\3/32\ inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 
4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length uniformity 80 
through 82 percent) cotton as quoted each Thursday in the designated 
U.S. spot markets for any week is:
    (i) More than 115 percent of the estimated actual cost associated 
with transporting U.S. cotton to northern Europe, then 115 percent of 
such actual cost shall be substituted in lieu thereof for such week.
    (ii) Less than 85 percent of the estimated actual cost associated 
with transporting U.S. cotton to northern Europe, then 85 percent of 
such actual cost shall be substituted in lieu thereof for such week.
    (2) If a Thursday price quotation for either the U.S. Memphis 
territory or the California/Arizona territory, as quoted for M 1\3/32\ 
inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, is not available for any week, CCC:
    (i) May use the available northern Europe quotation to determine the 
difference between the average price quotations for the U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory, as quoted for M 1\3/32\ 
inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, and the average price of M 1\3/32\ 
inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 
25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length uniformity 80 through 82 
percent) cotton, as quoted each Thursday in the designated U.S. spot 
markets for that week, or
    (ii) May not take that week into consideration.
    (3) If Thursday price quotations for any week are not available for 
either,
    (i) Both the Memphis territory and the California/Arizona territory 
as quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, or
    (ii) The average price of M 1\3/32\ inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 
through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per 
tex, length uniformity 80 through 82 percent) cotton, as quoted

[[Page 476]]

in the designated U.S. spot markets, that week will not be considered.
    (e) The upland cotton AWP, determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section, and the amount of the additional adjustment determined under 
paragraph (f) of this section, shall be announced, to the extent 
practicable, at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard time each Thursday continuing 
through the last Thursday of July, 2008. In the event that Thursday is a 
non-workday, the determination will be announced, to the extent 
practicable, at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard time the next work day.
    (f)(1)(i) The AWP, as determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section, shall be subject to further adjustments as provided in this 
section regarding all qualities of upland cotton eligible for loan 
except the following upland cotton grades with a staple length of 1\1/
16\ inch or longer:
    (A) White Grades--Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 6; 
Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 6; Strict Low Middling, leaf 1 through 
leaf 6; and Low Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 5;
    (B) Light Spotted Grades--Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through 
leaf 5; Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 5; and Strict Low Middling, leaf 1 
through leaf 4; and
    (C) Spotted Grades--Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 
2; and
    (ii) Grade and staple length must be determined under Sec. 1427.9. 
If no such official classification is presented, the coarse count 
adjustment shall not be made.
    (2) The adjustment for upland cotton provided under paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section shall be determined by deducting from the AWP:
    (i) The difference between the NE, and
    (A) During the period when only one daily price quotation for each 
growth quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, is 
available the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday 
through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths 
quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe; or
    (B) During the period when both current shipment prices and forward 
shipment prices are available for the growths quoted for ``coarse 
count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe, the result calculated by the 
following procedure: Beginning with the first week covering the period 
Friday through Thursday including April 15 or, if both the average of 
the current shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday 
for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for ``coarse 
count'' cotton, C.I.F. northern Europe (Northern Europe coarse count 
current price (NECCc)), and the average of the forward shipment prices 
for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced 
growths of the growths quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton, C.I.F. 
northern Europe (Northern Europe coarse count forward price (NECCf)), 
are not available during that period, beginning with the first week 
covering the period Friday through Thursday after the week including 
April 15 in which both the Northern Europe coarse count current price 
and the Northern Europe coarse count forward price are available:
    (1) Weeks 1 and 2: (2 x NECCc) + NECCf)/3;
    (2) Weeks 3 and 4: (NECCc + NECCf)/2;
    (3) Weeks 5 and 6: (NECCc + (2 x NECCf))/3; and
    (4) Week 7 through July 31: The NECCf, minus:
    (ii) The difference between the applicable loan rate for an upland 
cotton crop for M 1\3/32\ inch, leaf 3, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 
4.3 through 4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length 
uniformity 80 through 82 percent) cotton and the loan rate for an upland 
cotton crop for SLM 1\1/16\ inch, leaf 4, (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 
and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 25.5 through 29.4 grams per tex, length 
uniformity 80 through 82 percent) cotton.
    (iii) The result of the calculation as determined under this 
paragraph shall hereinafter be referred to as the ``Northern Europe 
coarse count price.''
    (3) Regarding the determination of the Northern Europe coarse count 
price under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section:
    (i) If no quotes are available for one or more days of the 5-day 
period, the available quotes will be used;
    (ii) If quotes for three growths are not available for any day in 
the 5-day

[[Page 477]]

period, that day will not be considered; and
    (iii) If quotes for three growths are not available for at least 3 
days in the 5-day period, that week will not be considered, in which 
case the adjustment determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
for the latest available week will continue to be applicable.
    (g) If the 6-week transition period from using current shipment 
prices to using forward shipment prices in the determination of the NE 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Northern Europe coarse 
count price under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section do not begin at 
the same time, CCC shall use either current shipment prices, forward 
shipment prices, or any combination thereof to determine the NE and/or 
the Northern Europe coarse count price used in the determination of the 
adjustment for upland cotton under paragraph (f)(1) of this section and 
determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to prevent distortions 
in such adjustment.
    (h) The AWP determined under paragraph (c) of this section, shall be 
subject to further adjustments to a value no less than zero, as CCC 
determines, based upon the Schedule of Premiums and Discounts and the 
location differentials applicable to each warehouse location as 
announced under the loan program for an upland cotton crop.

the NE during the period when only one daily price quotation is 
available for each growth quoted for M 1\3/32\-inch cotton, delivered 
cost insurance, and freight (C.I.F.) northern Europe, or the USNEc and 
the NEc, or the USNEf and the NEf. In that case, CCC may establish a 
payment rate at a level it determines to be appropriate, taking into 
consideration the payment rate determined under paragraph (a) of this 
section for the most recent available week; and
    (iii) Beginning July 18, 1996, if no daily quotes are available for 
the entire 5-day period for either or both the USNEc and the NEc, the 
marketing year transition shall be implemented immediately.

[[Page 480]]

    (2) Regarding the determination of the USNE, the USNEc, and the 
USNEf, if a quotation for either the U.S. Memphis territory or the 
California/Arizona territory, as quoted for M 1\3/32\-inch cotton, 
delivered C.I.F. northern Europe, is not available for each day or any 
day of the 5-day period, available quotation(s) will be used.
    (d) Payment rates for semi-processed motes that are of a quality 
suitable, without further processing, for spinning, papermaking or 
bleaching shall be based on a percentage of the basic rate for baled 
lint, as specified in the Upland Cotton Domestic User/Exporter 
Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.108  Payment.

    (a) Payments under this subpart shall be determined by multiplying:
    (1) The payment rate, determined under Sec. 1427.107, by
    (2) The net weight (gross weight minus the weight of bagging and 
ties), determined under paragraph (b) of this section, of eligible 
upland cotton bales an eligible domestic user opens or an eligible 
exporter sold for export during the Friday through Thursday period 
following a week in which a payment rate is established.
    (b) For the purposes of this subpart, the net weight shall be 
determined based upon:
    (1) For domestic users, the weight on which settlement for payment 
of the cotton was based (landed mill weight);
    (2) For reginned motes processed by an end user who converted such 
motes, without rebaling, to an end use in a continuous manufacturing 
process, the net weight of the reginned motes after final cleaning;
    (3) For exporters, the shipping warehouse weight or the gin weight 
if the cotton was not placed in a warehouse, of the eligible cotton 
unless the exporter obtains and pays the cost of having all the bales in 
the shipment reweighed by a licensed weigher and furnishes a copy of the 
certified reweights.
    (c) For the purposes of this subpart, eligible upland cotton will be 
considered--
    (1) Consumed by the domestic user on the date the bale is opened for 
consumption; and
    (2) Exported by the exporter on the date CCC determines is the date 
on which the cotton is shipped through July 31, 2008.
    (d) Payments under this subpart shall be made available upon 
application for payment and submission of supporting documentation, 
including proof of purchase and consumption of eligible cotton by the 
domestic user or proof of export of eligible cotton by the exporter, as 
required by the CCC-issued provisions of the Upland Cotton Domestic

<R05>
Sec. 1427.160  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to the 2002 through 2007 crops of 
upland and extra long staple seed cotton. These regulations set forth 
the terms and conditions under which recourse seed cotton loans shall be 
made available by CCC. Such loans will be available through March 31 of 
the year following the calendar year in which such crop is normally 
harvested. CCC may change the loan availability period to conform to 
State or locally imposed quarantines. Additional terms and conditions 
are in the note and security agreement which must be executed by a 
producer in order to receive such loans.
    (b) Loan rates and the forms which are used in administering the 
recourse seed cotton loan program for a crop of cotton are available in 
FSA State and county offices. Loan rates shall be based upon the 
location at which the loan collateral is stored.
    (c) A producer must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request the 
loan at the county office which, under part 718 of this title, is 
responsible for administering programs for the farm on which the cotton 
was produced. A CMA must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request 
the loan at a central county office designated by the State committee. 
All note and security agreements and related documents necessary for the 
administration of the recourse seed cotton loan program shall

[[Page 481]]

be prescribed by CCC and shall be available at State and county offices.
    (d) Loans shall not be available for seed cotton produced on land 
owned or otherwise in the possession of the United States if such land 
is occupied without the consent of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.161  Administration.

    (a) The recourse seed cotton loan program which is applicable to a 
crop of cotton shall be administered under the general supervision of 
the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee and shall be carried 
out in the field by State and county FSA committees (State and county 
committees, respectively).
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and employees 
thereof, do not have the authority to modify or waive any of the 
provisions of the regulations of this subpart.
    (c) The State committee shall take any action required by these 
regulations which has not been taken by the county committee. The State 
committee shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, an action 
taken by such county committee which is not under the regulations of 
this subpart; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action which 
is not under the regulations of this subpart.
    (d) No provision or delegation herein to a State or county committee 
shall preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC (Administrator, FSA), 
or a designee from determining any question arising under the recourse 
seed cotton program or from reversing or modifying any determination 
made by the State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator, FSA, may authorize waiver or 
modification of deadlines and other program requirements where lateness 
or failure to meet such other requirements does not adversely affect the 
operation of the recourse seed cotton loan program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute loan applications and 
related documents only under the terms and conditions determined and 
announced by CCC. Any such document which is not executed under such 
terms and conditions, including any purported execution before the date 
authorized by CCC, shall be null and void.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.163  Disbursement of loans.

    (a) A producer or the producer's agent shall request a loan at the 
county office for the county which, under part 718 of this title, is 
responsible for administering programs for the farm on which the cotton 
was produced and which will assist the producer in completing the loan 
documents, except that CMA's designated by producers to obtain loans in 
their behalf may, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, obtain loans 
through a central county office designated by the State committee.
    (b) Disbursement of each loan will be made by the county office of 
the county which is responsible for administering programs for the farm 
on which the cotton was produced, except that CMA's designated by 
producers to obtain loans in their behalf may, unless otherwise 
authorized by CCC, obtain disbursement of loans at a central county 
office designated by the State committee. Service charges shall be 
deducted from the loan proceeds. The producer or the producer's agent 
shall not present the loan documents for disbursement unless the cotton 
is in existence and in good condition. If the cotton is not in existence 
and in good condition at the time of disbursement, the producer or the 
agent shall immediately return the check issued in payment of the loan 
or, if the check has been negotiated, the total amount disbursed under 
the loan, and charges plus interest shall be refunded promptly.

collateral for a CCC loan and redeemed;
    (6) Be production from acreage that has been reported timely under 
part 718 of this title; and
    (b) The quality of cotton which may be pledged as collateral for a

sample of the lot of cotton is classed by an Agricultural Marketing 
Service (AMS) Cotton Classing Office or other entity approved by CCC, 
the quality for the lot shall be the quality shown on the applicable 
documentation issued for the control sample.
    (c) To be eligible for loan, the beneficial interest in the seed 
cotton must be in the producer who is pledging the seed cotton as 
collateral for a loan as provided in Sec. 1427.5(c).


<R05>

    The seed cotton must be insured at the full loan value against loss 
or damage by fire.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.167  Liens.

placed on the cotton after the loan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.168  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.169  Fees, charges, and interest.

    (a) A producer shall pay a non-refundable loan service fee to CCC at 
a rate determined by CCC.
    (b) Interest which accrues for a loan shall be determined under part 
1405 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.170  Quantity for loan.

    (a) The quantity of lint cotton in each lot of seed cotton tendered 
for loan shall be determined by the county office by multiplying the 
weight or estimated weight of seed cotton by the lint turnout factor 
determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The lint turnout factor for any lot of seed cotton shall be the 
percentage determined by the county committee representative during the 
initial inspection of the lot. If a control portion of the lot is 
weighed and ginned, the turnout factor determined for the portion of 
cotton ginned will be used for the lot. If a control portion is not 
weighed and ginned, the lint turnout factor shall not exceed 32 percent 
for machine-picked cotton and 22 percent for machine-stripped cotton 
unless acceptable proof is furnished showing that the lint turnout 
factor is greater.
    (c) Loans shall not be made on more than a percentage established by 
the county committee of the quantity of lint cotton determined as 
provided in this section. If the seed cotton is weighed, the percentage 
to be used shall not be more than 95 percent. If the quantity is 
determined by measurement, the percentage to be used shall not be more 
than 90 percent. The percentage to be used in determining the maximum 
quantity for any loan may be reduced below such percentages by the 
county committee when determined necessary to protect the interests of 
CCC on the basis of one or more of the following risk factors:
    (1) Condition or suitability of the storage site or structure;
    (2) Condition of the cotton;
    (3) Location of the storage site or structure; and
    (4) Other factors peculiar to individual farms or producers which 
related to the preservation or safety of the loan collateral. Loans may 
be made on a lower percentage basis at the producer's request.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.171  Approved storage.

    Approved storage shall consist of storage located on or off the 
producer's

[[Page 483]]

farm (excluding public warehouses) which is determined by a county 
committee representative to afford adequate protection against loss or 
damage and which is located within a reasonable distance, as determined 
by CCC, from an approved gin. If the cotton is not stored on the 
producer's farm, the producer must furnish satisfactory evidence that 
the producer has the authority to store the cotton on such property and 
that the owner of such property has no lien for such storage against the 
cotton. The producer must provide satisfactory evidence that the 
producer and any person having an interest in the cotton including CCC, 
have the right to enter the premises to inspect and examine the cotton 
and shall permit a reasonable time to such persons to remove the cotton 
from the premises.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.172  Settlement.

    (a) A producer may, at any time before maturity of the loan, obtain 
release of all or any part of the loan seed cotton by paying to CCC the 
amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.
    (b)(1) A producer or the producer's agent shall not remove from 
storage any cotton which is pledged as collateral for a loan until prior 
written approval has been received from CCC for removal of such cotton. 
If a producer or the producer's agent obtains such approval, they may 
remove such cotton from storage, sell the seed cotton, have it ginned, 
and sell the lint cotton and cottonseed obtained therefrom. The ginner 
shall inform the county office in writing immediately after the seed 
cotton removed from storage has been ginned and furnish the county 
office the loan number, producer's name, and applicable gin bale 
numbers. If the seed cotton is removed from storage, the loan principal 
plus interest and charges thereon must be satisfied not later than the 
earlier of:
    (i) The date established by the county committee;
    (ii) 5 days after the date of the producer received the AMS 
classification under Sec. 1427.9 (and the warehouse receipt, if the 
cotton is delivered to a warehouse), representing such cotton; or
    (iii) The loan maturity date.
    (2) If the seed cotton or lint cotton is sold, the loan principal, 
interest, and charges must be satisfied immediately.
    (3) A producer, except a CMA, may obtain a nonrecourse loan or loan 
deficiency payment under subpart A of this part, on the lint cotton, 
but:
    (i) The loan principal, interest, and charges on the seed cotton 
must be satisfied from the proceeds of the nonrecourse loan under 
subpart A of this part; or
    (ii) The loan deficiency payment must be applied to the loan 
principal, interest, and charges on the outstanding seed cotton loan.
    (4) A CMA must repay the seed cotton loan principal, interest, and 
charges before pledging the cotton for a nonrecourse loan or before a 
loan deficiency payment can be approved under subpart A of this part, on 
the lint cotton. If CMA's authorized by producers to obtain loans in 
their behalf remove seed cotton from storage before obtaining approval 
to move such cotton, such removal shall constitute conversion of such 
cotton unless the CMA:
    (i) Notifies the county office in writing the following morning by 
mail or otherwise that such cotton has been moved and is on the gin 
yard;
    (ii) Furnishes CCC an irrevocable letter of credit if requested; and
    (iii) Repays the loan principal, plus interest and charges, within 
the time specified by the county committee.
    (5) Any removal from storage shall not be deemed to constitute a 
release of CCC's security interest in the seed cotton or to release the 
producer or CMA from liability for the loan principal, interest, and 
charges if full payment of such amount is not received by the county 
office.
    (c) If, either before or after maturity, the producer discovers that 
the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of 
condition, the producer shall immediately notify the county office and 
confirm such notice in writing. If the county committee determines that 
the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of 
condition, the county committee will call for repayment of the loan 
principal, plus interest and charges on

[[Page 484]]

or before a specified date. If the producer does not repay the loan or 
have the cotton ginned and obtain a nonrecourse loan under subpart A of 
this part on the lint cotton produced therefrom within the period as 
specified by the county committee, the cotton shall be considered 
abandoned.
    (d) If the producer has control of the storage site and if the 
producer subsequently loses control of the storage site or there is 
danger of flood or damage to the seed cotton or storage structure making 
continued storage of the cotton unsafe, the producer shall immediately 
either repay the loan or move the seed cotton to the nearest approved 
gin for ginning and shall, at the same time, inform the county office. 
If the producer does not do so, the seed cotton shall be considered 
abandoned.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.173  Foreclosure.

    Any seed cotton pledged as collateral for a loan which is abandoned 
or which has not been ginned and pledged as collateral for a nonrecourse 
loan under subpart A of this part by the seed cotton loan maturity date 
may be removed from storage by CCC and ginned and the resulting lint 
cotton warehoused for the account of CCC. The lint cotton and cottonseed 
may be sold, at such time, in such manner, and upon such terms as CCC 
may determine, at public or private sale. CCC may become the purchaser 
of the whole or any part of such cotton and cottonseed. If the proceeds 
received from the sales of the cotton are less than the amount due on 
the loan (including principal, interest, ginning charges, and any other 
charges incurred by CCC), the producer shall be liable for such 
difference. If the proceeds received from sale of the cotton are greater 
than the sum of the amount due plus any cost incurred by CCC in 
conducting the sale of the cotton, the amount of such excess shall be 
paid to the producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of the 
producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.174  Maturity of seed cotton loans.

    Seed cotton loans mature on demand by CCC but no later than May 31 
following the calendar year in which such crop is normally harvested.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.175  Liability of the producer.

    (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in 
obtaining a loan, maintaining a loan, or settling a loan or if the 
producer disposes of or moves the loan collateral without the prior 
approval of CCC, such loan amount shall be refunded upon demand by CCC. 
The producer shall be liable for:
    (i) The amount of the loan;
    (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC for the loan;
    (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts; and
    (v) Liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding any provision of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent representation or 
if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without 
prior written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral acquired 
by CCC shall be equal to the sales price of the cotton less any costs 
incurred by CCC in completing the sale.
    (b) If the amount disbursed under a loan, or in settlement thereof, 
exceeds the amount authorized by this subpart, the producer shall be 
liable for repayment of such excess, plus interest. In addition, seed 
cotton pledged as collateral for such loan shall not be released to the 
producer until such excess is repaid.
    (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan is less than the amount required under this subpart, the producer 
shall be personally liable for repayment of the amount of such 
deficiency plus applicable interest.
    (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
with CCC, each such producer shall be jointly and severally liable for 
the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security 
agreement and the regulations in this subpart. Each such producer shall 
also remain liable for repayment of the entire loan amount until the 
loan is fully repaid without regard to such producer's

[[Page 485]]

claimed share in the seed cotton pledged as collateral for the loan. In 
addition, such producer may not amend the note and security agreement 
for the producer's claimed share in such seed cotton, after execution of 
the note and security agreement by CCC.
    (e) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC if a producer makes 
any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or in maintaining or 
settling a loan or disposing of or moving the collateral without the 
prior approval of CCC. Accordingly, if CCC or the county committee 
determines that the producer has violated the terms or conditions of the 
note and security agreement, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the 
quantity of the seed cotton which is involved in the violation. If CCC 
or the county committee determines the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
first offense;
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases 
other than first or second offense, liquidated damages will be assessed 
by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 percent of 
the loan rate applicable to the loan note.
    (f) For first and second offenses, if CCC or the county committee 
determines that a producer acted in good faith when the violation 
occurred, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan 
quantity affected by the violation, and charges plus interest applicable 
to the amount repaid;
    (2) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; 
and
    (3) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days 
from the date of notification, call the applicable loan involved in the 
violation.
    (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense 
for which CCC or the county committee cannot determine good faith when 
the violation occurred, the county committee shall:
    (1) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section;
    (2) Call the applicable loan involved in the violation.
    (h) If CCC or the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation under paragraph (e) of this section, the county 
committee shall notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information to the county committee regarding the circumstances which 
caused the violation, and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken under paragraphs (f) or (g) 
of this section.
    (i) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under the 
provision of paragraph (e) of this section may be waived as determined 
by CCC.

  Subpart E_Standards for Approval of Warehouses for Cotton and Cotton 
                                 Linters

    Authority: Secs. 4 and 5, 62 Stat. 1070, as amended, 1072, as 
amended (15 U.S.C. 714 b and c).

    Source: 44 FR 67085, Nov. 23, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1081  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the approval by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of warehouse(s) for the 
storage and handling of cotton and cotton linters, under a Cotton 
Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or held by CCC as security for 
price support loans. This subpart is not applicable to cotton or cotton 
linters purchased in storage for prompt shipment or to handling 
operations of a temporary nature.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining

[[Page 486]]

approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas City 
Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, Kansas 
City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by the KCCO and a storage agreement 
must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC will use 
such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering into of a 
storage agreement does not constitute a commitment that CCC will use the 
warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman, when applying for approval under this subpart 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-49, ``Application for Approval of Warehouse 
for Storage of Cotton and/or Cotton Linters,''
    (2) A current financial statement on Form WA-51, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee. 
Financial statements shall show the financial condition of the 
warehouseman as of a date no earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the 
date of the warehouseman's application, or such other date as CCC may 
prescribe. Additional financial statements shall be furnished annually 
and at such other times as CCC may require. CCC also may require that 
financial statements prepared by the warehouseman or by a public 
accountant be examined by an independent certified public accountant in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Only one 
financial statement is required for a chain of warehouses owned or 
operated by a single business entity. If approved by the Director, KCCO, 
or the Director's designee, the financial statement of a parent company, 
which includes the financial position of a wholly-owned subsidiary, may 
be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for the wholly-owned 
subsidiary.
    (3) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1427.1082(a)(2) and such 
other documents or information as CCC may require,
    (4) For warehouseman not operating under the U.S. Warehouse Act, a 
sample copy of the warehouseman's receipts and bale tags, and
    (5) Evidence of applicable fire insurance rates.

CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC-owned or -loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for

the warehouse can accommodate when stored in the customary manner) times 
ten (10) dollars per bale. The net worth need not exceed $250,000. If 
the calculated net worth exceeds $25,000, the warehouseman may satisfy 
any deficiency in net worth between the $25,000 minimum requirement and 
such calculated net worth by furnishing bond (or acceptable substitute 
security) meeting the requirements of Sec. 1427.1083,
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating

[[Page 487]]

    (6) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,
    (7) Use only card type warehouse receipts which are pre-numbered and 
pre-punched or such other document as CCC may prescribe,
    (8) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable 
firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored

applicable commodity,
    (2) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all 
times, and
    (3) Not be subject to greater than normal risk of fire, flood, or 
other hazards.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1083  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process and in the State where the warehouse is 
located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC.
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than ninety (90) days or 
includes a rider providing for not less than ninety (90) days' notice to 
CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a substitute bond for one 
warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC against insufficient 
bond coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may

[[Page 488]]

Sec. 1427.1084  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage and handling of the commodity and periodically 
thereafter to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1085  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this report:
    (a) The financial bond and original and periodic warehouse 
examination provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman 
approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of cotton 
or cotton linters under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under 
the U.S. Warehouse Act for such commodity but a special examination 
shall be made of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is 
necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $25,000 but who 
fails, or whose warehouse fails, to meet one or more of the other 
standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity,
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1086  Approval of warehouse, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart, and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. This notice will state the cause(s) for such action. 
Unless the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1427.1082, other than the standard set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after 
receiving notice of such action, request reconsideration of the action 
and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of 
such request. The Director shall consider such information in making a 
determination of notify the warehouseman in writing of such 
determination. The warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's 
determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal 
hearing thereon by filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as 
``FSA''). The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, 
nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the 
hearing shall be as prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 
7 CFR part 780. When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman 
shall be considered as a ``participant''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1427.1082(c)(2), the ware house man's administrative 
appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in 
accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period 
of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

Sec. 1427.1087  Exemption from requirements.

    (a) If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of this subpart and no reasonable and economical alternative 
is available for securing such services for commodities under CCC 
programs, the President or Executive Vice President, CCC may exempt, in 
writing, applicants in such area from one or more of the standards of 
this subpart and may establish such other standards as are considered 
necessary to safeguard satisfactorily the interests of CCC.
    (b) Warehousemen who are currently under contract with CCC will be 
required to meet the terms and conditions of these regulations at the 
time of renewal of their contract.

Sec. 1427.1088  Contract fees.

    (a) Each warehouseman who has a non-federally licensed cotton 
warehouse must pay an annual contract fee for each such warehouse for 
which the warehouseman requests renewal of an existing Cotton Storage 
Agreement or approval of a new Cotton Storage Agreement as follows:
    (1) A warehouseman who has an existing Cotton Storage Agreement with 
CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or cotton pledged 
to CCC as loan collateral must pay an annual contract fee for each 
warehouse approved under such agreement in advance of the renewal date 
of such agreement.
    (2) A warehouseman who does not have an existing Cotton Storage 
Agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or 
cotton pledged to CCC as loan collateral but who desires such an 
agreement must pay a contract fee for each warehouse for which CCC 
approval is sought prior to the time that the agreement is approved by 
CCC.
    (b) The amount of the contract fee shall be determined and announced

and Certification.
    (c) Applicants signing the cottonseed payment application or 
receiving payment under this subpart must share any payment with the 
producer of the cotton that was the basis of the cottonseed payment to 
the extent that the effect of low cottonseed prices was borne by the 
producer rather than the gin. To the extent that such funds will be 
shared with the producer by the gin, those funds will be considered to 
have been received by the applicant on behalf of such producers.

would provide an excess rate of payment in which case an alternative 
method will be used as determined appropriate by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1110  Payment calculation and form.

    (a) Payments in accordance with this subpart shall be determined for 
individual applicants by multiplying:
    (1) The payment rate, determined in accordance with Sec. 1427.1109, 
by
    (2) The eligible payment quantity of the applicant, determined in 
accordance with Sec. 1427.1107 and other provisions of this subpart.

    (a) If any person makes any erroneous or fraudulent representation 
in obtaining a cottonseed payment under this part, or in connection with 
such a payment engages in a scheme or device that tends to defeat the 
purposes of this program, the person shall be liable to CCC for the 
amount of the payment and interest on such payment as determined by CCC. 
Such remedy will be in addition to whatever additional remedies may be 
allowed by law.
    (b) If more than one person executes a program payment application 
with CCC and payments are made thereunder, each such person shall be 
jointly and severally liable for any violation of the terms and 
conditions for any payment made to anyone under that application or for 
any refund due from any person signing that application. Such liability 
shall remain until payment in full is made of any such refund and its 
related charges.
    (c) If a person receives a program payment in excess of the amount 
authorized by this subpart, that person

[[Page 492]]

shall refund to CCC an amount equal to the excess payment, plus interest 
thereon, as determined by CCC.
    (d) From the date of the payment application until the earlier of 3 
years after the date of the application or July 31, 2006, the applicant 
shall keep records, including records supporting the quantity of 
cottonseed for which payment was requested, and furnish such information 
and reports relating to the application to CCC as requested. Such 
records shall be available at all reasonable times for an audit or 
inspection by authorized representatives of CCC, United States 
Department of Agriculture, or the Comptroller General of the United 
States. Failure to keep, or make available, such records may result in 
refund to CCC of all payments received, plus interest thereon, as 
determined by CCC. In the event of a controversy concerning payments or 
questions involving the payments, records must be kept for such longer 
period as may be specified by CCC until such controversy is resolved.

Sec. 1427.1207  Payment rate.

    (a) The payment rate for payments made under this subpart shall be 
determined as follows:
    (1) Beginning the Thursday following August 1 and ending the week in 
which the current LFQ and the forward LFQ may first become available, 
the payment rate shall be the difference between the U.S. Pima spot 
price and the LFQ in the fourth week of a consecutive 4-week period in 
which the U.S. Pima spot price exceeded the LFQ each week, and the LFQ 
was less than 134 percent of the current crop year loan level for U.S. 
base quality Pima cotton in all weeks of the 4-week period; and
    (2) Beginning the Friday through Thursday week after the week in 
which the current LFQ and the forward LFQ may first become available and 
ending the Thursday following July 31, the payment rate shall be the 
difference between the U.S. Pima spot price and the current LFQ in the 
fourth week of a consecutive 4-week period in which the U.S. Pima spot 
price exceeded the current LFQ each week, and the current LFQ was less 
than 134 percent of the current crop year loan level for base quality 
U.S. Pima in all weeks of the 4-week period. If the current LFQ is not 
available, the payment rate may be the difference between the U.S. Pima 
spot price and the forward LFQ.
    (b) Whenever a 4-week period under paragraph (a) of this section 
contains a combination of LFQ, current LFQ and forward LFQ for only one 
to three weeks, such as may occur in the spring when the LFQ price is 
succeeded by the current LFQ and the forward LFQ (Spring transition) and 
at the start of a new marketing year when the current LFQ and the 
forward LFQ are succeeded by the LFQ (marketing year transition), under 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, during both the spring 
transition and the marketing year transition periods, to the extent 
practicable, the current LFQ in combination with the LFQ shall be 
considered during such 4-week periods to determine whether a payment is 
to be issued. During both the spring transition and the marketing year 
transition periods, if the current LFQ is not available, the forward LFQ 
in combination with the LFQ shall be taken into consideration during 
such 4-week periods to determine whether a payment is to be issued.
    (c) For purposes of this subpart, regarding the determination of the 
U.S. Pima spot price, the LFQ, the current LFQ and the forward LFQ:
    (1) If daily quotations are not available for one or more days of 
the 5-day period, the available quotations during the period will be 
used;
    (2) If the U.S. Pima spot price is not available or if none of the 
LFQ, current LFQ or forward LFQ is available, the payment rate shall be 
zero and shall remain zero unless and until sufficient U.S. Pima spot 
prices and/or LFQ again become available, the U.S. Pima spot price 
exceeds the LFQ, the current LFQ or the forward LFQ, as the case may be, 
and the LFQ, the current LFQ, or the forward LFQ, as the case may be, is 
less than 134 percent of the current crop year loan rate for base 
quality U.S. Pima for 4 consecutive weeks.
    (d) Payment rates for loose, reginned motes and semi-processed motes 
that are of a quality suitable, without further processing, for 
spinning, papermaking or bleaching shall be based on a percentage of the 
basic rate for baled lint, as specified in the ELS Cotton Domestic User/
Exporter Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1208  Payment.

    (a) Payments under this subpart shall be determined by multiplying:
    (1) The payment rate, determined under Sec. 1427.127, by
    (2) The net weight (gross weight minus the weight of bagging and 
ties) determined under paragraph (b) of this section, of eligible ELS 
cotton bales that an eligible domestic user opens or an eligible 
exporter exports during the Friday through Thursday period following a 
week in which a payment rate is established.
    (b) For the purposes of this subpart, the net weight shall be based 
upon:

[[Page 495]]

    (1) For domestic users, the weight on which settlement for payment 
of the ELS cotton was based (landed mill weight);
    (2) For reginned motes processed by an end user who converted such 
motes, without rebaling, to an end use in a continuous manufacturing 
process, the net weight of the reginned motes after final cleaning;
    (3) For exporters, the shipping warehouse weight or the gin weight 
if the ELS cotton was not placed in a warehouse, of the eligible cotton 
unless the exporter obtains and pays the cost of having all the bales in

want its payments to begin with the first month of the fiscal year, must 
designate the starting month that it desires CCC to begin making 
payments to them. The starting month must be selected on or before the 
15th of the month before the month for which payment is sought. A dairy

    (2) Dairy operations that desire payments to begin with the first 
month of the fiscal year will receive payments made by CCC consecutively 
on a monthly basis until the earlier of the following:
    (i) The maximum payment quantity is reached as determined in 
accordance with Sec. 1430.207; or
    (ii) The end of the applicable fiscal year.
    (e) All producers involved in the dairy operation must agree to the

purpose of reaching the maximum payment quantity.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.206  Transition payments.

    (a) MILC program participants shall receive a payment calculated

    (1) The maximum payment quantity on eligible production, as 
described in Sec. 1430.207;

if applicable the beginning of the fiscal year thereafter, until the 
earlier of the following is reached for a particular fiscal year:
    (i) The maximum applicable payment quantity is reached as determined 
in accordance with Sec. 1430.207; or
    (ii) The end of the applicable fiscal year.
    (c) With respect to the 2002 Fiscal Year, the dairy operation may 
elect to forgo their transition payment and choose to begin receiving 
payments in September, 2002 in accordance with Sec. 1430.205.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this subpart, dairy 
operations that go out of business after December 1, 2001, may enter 
into a MILC with CCC for a transition payment on the quantity of 
eligible production marketed by the dairy operation during the 
transition period while the dairy operation was in business.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.207  Dairy operation payment quantity.

    (a) The applicant's payment quantity of milk will be determined by 
CCC, based on the quantity of milk that was produced and commercially 
marketed by each dairy operation per fiscal year.
    (b) The maximum quantity of eligible production for which dairy 
operations are eligible for payment per any fiscal year, including any 
in the transition year, under this subpart shall be 2.4 million pounds 
(24,000 cwt.) per separate and distinct operation. In accordance with 
these regulations, the Deputy Administrator shall determine what is a 
separate and distinct operation and that decision shall be final.


<R05>

    (a) Payments under this subpart may be made to dairy operations when 
the Boston Class I milk price under the applicable Federal milk 
marketing order is below $16.94 per cwt. No payments will be made to 
dairy operations for marketings during the months that the Boston Class 
I milk price under the applicable milk marketing order exceeds $16.94.
    (b) A per-hundredweight payment rate will be determined for the 
applicable month by:
    (1) Subtracting from $16.94 the Class I milk price per cwt in 
Boston; and
    (2) Multiplying the difference, if positive, by 45 percent.
    (c) Each eligible dairy operation payment will be calculated, as 
determined by the Secretary, by:
    (1) Converting whole pounds of milk to hundredweight; and
    (2) Multiplying the payment rate determined in paragraph (b) of this 
section by the quantity of eligible production marketed by the operation 
during the applicable month as determined according to Sec. 1430.205 
and other provisions of these regulations.
    (d) Payments under this subpart may be made to a dairy operation 
only up to the first 2.4 million pounds of eligible milk production per 
applicable fiscal year, including any year in the transition period.
    (e) Dairy operations receiving benefits under this subpart, will 
receive payments on a monthly basis according to the MILC, to the extent 
practicable, not later than 60 days after the production evidence and 
all supporting documents for the applicable month are received by CCC. 
Payments issued by CCC later than 60 days after all production evidence 
and supporting documentation are received by CCC will be

[[Page 500]]

subject to prompt payment interest as allowed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.209  Proof of marketings.

    (a) A dairy operation entering into an MILC must, based on 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide adequate proof 
of the dairy operation's eligible production during the months of each 
fiscal year designated in the MILC. The dairy operation must also 
provide proof that the eligible production was commercially marketed 
during the months beginning December 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 
2005. Evidence of milk production claimed for payment shall be provided 
to CCC with supporting documentation under paragraph (b) of this 
section. All information provided is subject to verification, spot 
check, and audit by FSA. Further verification information may be 
obtained from the dairy operation's milk handler or marketing 
cooperative if deemed necessary by CCC to verify provided information. 
Refusal to allow FSA or any other agency of the Department of 
Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a 
determination of ineligibility for benefits under this subpart.
    (b) Eligible dairy operations marketing milk during the period 
specified in the MILC shall provide any available supporting documents 
from all producers in the dairy operation to assist CCC in verifying 
that the dairy operation produced and marketed milk commercially from 
the designated starting month and thereafter. Examples of supporting 
documentation include, but are not limited to: milk marketing payment 
stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies 
of any payments received as compensation from other sources, or any 
other documents available to confirm the production and production 
history of the dairy operation. Producers may also be required to allow 
CCC to examine the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting 
documentation requested is not presented to CCC or FSA, the request for 
MILC benefits will be disapproved.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.210  MILC agents.

    (a) MILC benefits may be disbursed by a dairy marketing cooperative 
that serves special groups or communities, such as an Amish or Mennonite 
community. Producers in such groups in a dairy operation may authorize 
an agent of a dairy cooperative or milk handler affiliated with such 
cooperative to obtain and disburse MILC benefits to the dairy operation.
    (b) The authorized MILC agent must on behalf of the dairy operation 
do the following:
    (1) Obtain an acceptable power of attorney or acceptable equivalent 
for the producers of the dairy operation that authorizes the agent to 
enter into an MILC contract;
    (2) Enter into a written agreement with CCC for approval to act as a 
MILC agent on a form prescribed by CCC;
    (3) Provide the dairy operation's monthly production evidence to the

elsewhere in this subpart, contracts under this subpart entered into by 
producers in a dairy operation shall cover eligible production marketed 
by the producers in the dairy operation during the period beginning with 
the first day of the month the producers in the dairy operation enter 
into contract and ending on September 30, 2005.
    (b) If a dairy goes out of business during the contract period, the 
MILC will be terminated immediately, except as applicable to earned 
payments.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.212  Contract modifications.

    (a) Producers in a dairy operation must notify FSA immediately of 
any changes that may affect their MILC. Changes include, but are not 
limited to changes to the starting month to receive payment for the next 
fiscal year, death of producer on the contract, new member joining the

other transfer action,

[[Page 501]]

or farm reconstitutions undertaken in accordance with Sec. 1430.213.
    (b) CCC may modify an MILC if such modifications are desirable to 
carry out purposes of the program or to facilitate the program's 
administration.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.213  Reconstitutions.

    (a) A dairy operation receiving MILC benefits may reorganize or 
restructure such that the constitution or makeup of their operation is 
reconstituted in another organizational framework. However, any 
operation that changes after December 1, 2001, is subject to a review by 
FSA to determine if the operation was reorganized for the sole purpose 
of receiving multiple payments.
    (b) A dairy operation that FSA determines has reorganized solely to 
receive additional MILC payments will be in violation of its contract 
and dealt in accordance with Sec. 1430.214.
    (c) If during the contract period a change in the dairy operation 
occurs, the modification to the MILC will not take effect until the 
first day of the fiscal year following the month FSA received 
notification of the changes. Changes include but are not limited to any 
producer affiliated with a dairy operation that has an approved MILC 
with CCC forming a new dairy operation that is not formed solely to 
receive additional MILC payments.
    (d) Changes resulting in the following will take effect immediately 
upon notification to CCC, in accordance with Sec. 1430.212:
    (1) Increases or reductions of shareholders or producers and their 
corresponding share amounts in the dairy operation; or
    (2) Purchases of a new dairy operation by a producer or producers 
not affiliated with an existing dairy operation that has an approved 
MILC with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.214  Violations.

    (a) If producers in a dairy operation violates the MILC or the 
requirements of this subpart, CCC may:
    (1) Terminate the MILC for the remainder of the fiscal year in which 
the violation occurs, and allow the producer to retain any payments 
received under the contract; or
    (2) Allow the MILC to remain in effect and require the producer to 
repay a portion of the payments received commensurate with the 
violation's severity, as CCC determines.
    (3) If the MILC is terminated under this section, the participant 
shall forfeit all rights to further MILC benefits and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received as CCC determines appropriate.
    (4) A producer or operation with a violation, as determined by CCC, 
shall refund all MILC funds disbursed under of this part. The remedies 
provided in this subpart shall be in addition to other civil, criminal, 
or administrative remedies which may apply.
    (b) A MILC is violated by the following actions:
    (1) Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the MILC and 
addendum;
    (2) Reconstitutions of the dairy operation for the sole purpose of 
receiving multiple program benefits;
    (3) Failure to comply with highly erodible land conservation and 
wetland provisions of this 7 CFR part 12 or their successor regulations;
    (4) Failure to meet the definition of a dairy operation according to 
Sec. 1430.202;
    (5) Any action that tends to defeat the purpose of the program, as 
CCC determines.

Service Agency may terminate any MILC by mutual agreement upon request 
of the participant if DAFP determines that termination is in the best 
interest of the public.
    (d) The DAFP may determine that failure of the dairy operation to 
perform the MILC does not warrant termination and may require the 
participant to refund part of the payments received or accept 
adjustments in the payment as the DAFP determines to be appropriate.

accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide 
adequate proof that the dairy operation was commercially marketing milk 
anytime during the fourth quarter of 1998. The dairy operation must also 
provide proof of production for the 1997 or 1998 calendar year to verify 
the base period. The documentary evidence of milk production claimed for

payment rate will be determined after the conclusion of the application 
period, and shall be calculated by:
    (1) Converting whole pounds of milk to cwt;

Program by the total eligible cwt submitted and approved for payment.
    (b) Each dairy operation payment will be calculated by multiplying 
the payment rate determined in paragraph (a) (3) of this section by the 
dairy operation's eligible production.
    (c) In the event that approval of all eligible applications would

become due in connection with the application, or this subpart, all 
payments made under this subpart to any dairy operation shall be

operation if CCC determines that payments or other assistance were 
provided to the producer was not eligible for such assistance. Such 
interest shall be charged at the rate of interest which the United 
States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date CCC made such 
benefits available. Such interest shall accrue from the date such 
benefits were made available to the date of repayment or the date 
interest increases as determined in accordance with applicable 
regulations. CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC determines 
that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any action 
of the dairy operation.

section may be waived by CCC with respect to refunds required of the 
dairy operation because of unintentional misaction on the part of the 
dairy operation, as determined by CCC.

in 7 CFR part 1403.

(ceanothus), snow-on-the-mountain, spurge (leafy spurge), tarweed, and 
similar objectionably-flavored honey or blends of honey as determined by 
the Director, Price Support Division, FSA. If any blends of honey 
contain such ineligible honey, the lot as a whole shall be considered 
ineligible for loan;

Sec. 1434.6  Beneficial interest.

    (a) To be eligible to receive marketing assistance loans under this 
part a producer must have the beneficial interest in the honey that is 
tendered to CCC for a loan. The producer must always have had the 
beneficial interest in the honey unless, before the honey was extracted, 
the producer and a former producer whom the producer tendering the honey 
to CCC has succeeded had such an interest in the

[[Page 510]]

honey. Honey obtained by gift or purchase shall not be eligible to be 
tendered to CCC for loans. Heirs who succeed to the beneficial interest 
of a deceased producer or who assume the decedent's obligations under an 
existing loan shall be eligible to receive loans whether succession to 
the honey occurs before or after extraction so long as the heir 
otherwise complies with the provisions of this part.
    (b) For the 2002 crop of honey, in the case of producers that would 
be eligible for a loan deficiency payment under this section except for 
the fact that the producers lost beneficial interest in the crop before 
October 18, 2002, the producers shall be eligible for a loan deficiency 
payment as of the date producers marketed or otherwise lost beneficial 
interest in the honey, as determined by the Secretary.
    (c) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the honey if the producer retains control, title, 
and risk of loss in the honey including the right to make all decisions 
regarding the tender of such honey to CCC for a loan, and the producer:
    (1) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, with respect to such 
honey if all other eligibility requirements are met and the option to 
purchase contains the following provision:

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the honey, as specified 
in 7 CFR part 1434, shall remain with the producer until the buyer 
exercises this option to purchase the honey. This option to purchase 
shall expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either the 
producer or the buyer, at the earlier of: (1) The maturity of any CCC 
loan which is secured by such honey; (2) the date the CCC claims title 
to such honey; or (3) such other date as provided in this option.''


or:

    (2) Enters into a contract to sell the honey if the producer retains 
title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the honey and the 
purchaser does not pay to the producer any advance payment amount or any 
incentive payment amount to enter into such contract except as provided 
in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (d) If loans are made available to producers through an approved CMA 
in accordance with part 1425 of this chapter, the beneficial interest in 
the honey must always have been in the producer-member who delivered the 
honey to the CMA or its member CMA's, except as otherwise provided in 
this section. Honey delivered to such a CMA shall not be eligible for 
loans if the producer-member who delivered the honey does not retain the 
right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of the honey as 
provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (e) A producer may, before the final date for obtaining a loan for 
honey, re-offer as loan honey any honey that has been previously pledged 
if the loan was repaid with principal plus interest, the loan on such 
re-offered honey shall have the same maturity date as the original loan.

<R05>
Sec. 1434.7  Approved storage.

    (a) Loans will be made only on honey in approved storage, which 
shall consist of a storage structure located on or off the farm that is 
determined by CCC to be under the control of the producer and affords 
safe storage for honey pledged as collateral for a loan. If the honey 
located in a farm storage structure is pledged as collateral that 
secures more than one loan, the honey must be segregated so as to 
preserve the identity of the honey securing such loan. Honey securing a 
loan must also be segregated from any honey not pledged as collateral 
for a loan that is stored in the same structure.
    (b) Producers may also obtain loans on honey packed in eligible 
containers and stored in facilities owned by third parties in which the 
honey of more than one person is stored if the honey that is to be 
pledged as collateral for a loan and that is stored identity preserved 
or is segregated from all other honey. Each container of the segregated 
quantity of honey shall be marked with the producer's name, loan number, 
and lot number so as to identify the honey from other honey stored in 
the structure.

previously used only to store honey. Plastic containers previously used 
to store chemicals, pesticides, or any other product or substance other 
than honey are ineligible for honey storage. The handle of each 
container must be firm and strong enough to permit carrying the filled 
container. The cover opening must not be damaged in any way that will 
prevent a tight seal. Containers that have been punctured and resealed 
will not be acceptable;
    (5) The 5-gallon metal containers must hold approximately 60 pounds

Sec. 1434.9  Determination of quantity.

    The amount of a marketing assistance loan and loan deficiency 
payment shall be based on 100 percent of the net weight in pounds of 
such quantity certified by the producer and verified by the county

of honey shall be made on the basis of 12 pounds for each gallon of 
rated capacity of the container.


<R05>

    (a) A producer must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request 
loans and loan deficiency payments at the appropriate FSA county office

for administering the program as provided under part 718 of this title. 
To receive loans and loan deficiency payments for honey, a producer 
shall execute a note and security agreement or loan deficiency payment 
application on or before March 31 of the year following the year in 
which the honey was extracted.
    (b) A producer must request a loan at the county office of the 
county where the honey is stored if the honey is stored at the 
producer's farm. A producer who requests a loan on honey stored in 
eligible storage other than the producer's farm, may request loans at 
either the county office of the county where the storage facility is 
located or at the county office of the county where the producer's main 
place of business is located. A CMA must request loans at the county 
office for the county in which the principal office of the CMA is 
located unless the State committee designates another county office. If 
the CMA has operations in two or more States, the CMA must file its loan 
applications at the county office for the county in which its principal 
office for each State is located.
    (c) Loans will be made on the honey as declared and certified by the 
producer on Form CCC-633 (Honey), (Honey Loan Certification and 
Worksheet) at the time the honey is pledged as collateral for a loan. 
The producer is also required to declare and certify on Form CCC-633 
(Honey) the class (table or nontable) and floral source of the honey at 
the time the honey is pledged as collateral for a loan.
    (d) The request for a loan shall not be approved until all producers 
having an interest in the honey sign the note and security agreement and 
CCC approves such note and security agreement. The disbursement of loans 
will be made by county offices on behalf of CCC, for honey that:
    (1) Has been extracted;
    (2) Is in eligible storage; and
    (3) Has not been blended or mixed with ineligible honey.
    (e) Loans mature on demand but not later than the last day of the 
ninth calendar month following the month in which the note and security 
agreement was approved. When the final maturity date falls on a non-
workday for county offices, CCC shall extend the final date to the next 
workday. Before the date determined in paragraph (a) of this section, a 
producer may re-offer as loan collateral any eligible honey that has 
been offered previously for a CCC loan and the loan has been repaid at 
principal plus interest only.
    (f) If, after a loan is made, CCC determines that the producer or 
the honey collateral is not in compliance with any of the provisions of 
this part, the producer shall refund the total amount disbursed under 
loan and charges plus interest, including late payment interest as 
provided in part 1403 of this title.

<R05>
Sec. 1434.11  Fees and interest.

    (a) A producer shall pay a nonrefundable loan service fee to CCC. 
The loan service fee shall be the smaller of one-half of 1 percent 
(.005) times the gross loan amount or $45 per loan plus $3 for each 
storage structure over one.
    (b) Interest that accrues with respect to a loan shall be determined 
in accordance with part 1405 of this chapter.

Sec. 1434.12  Liens.

    (a) CCC's security interest in the honey pledged as collateral is 
first and superior to all other security interests.
    (b) The county office shall file or record, as required by State 
law, all financing statements needed to perfect a security interest in 
honey pledged as collateral for a loan. The cost of filing and recording 
shall be for the account of CCC.
    (c) If there are any other security interests, liens, or 
encumbrances on the honey, CCC shall obtain waivers that fully protect 
the interest of CCC even though the security interests, liens, or 
encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional 
security interests, liens, or encumbrances shall be placed on the honey 
after the loan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.13  Transfer of producer's interest prohibited.

    Absent written approval from CCC, the producer shall not transfer 
either the remaining interest in, or right to redeem, the honey pledged 
as collateral for a loan on honey nor shall anyone

[[Page 513]]

acquire such interest or right. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 
1434.17, a producer who wishes to liquidate all or part of a loan by 
contracting for the sale of the honey must obtain written approval from 
the county office on a form prescribed by CCC to remove a specified 
quantity of the honey from storage. Any such approval shall be subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form, copies of 
which may be obtained by producers at the county office.


<R05>
Sec. 1434.14  Loss or damage.

    The producer is responsible for any loss in quantity or quality of 
the honey pledged as collateral for a loan. CCC shall not assume any

Sec. 1434.15  Personal liability of the producer.

    (a) When applying for an individual or joint loan or loan deficiency 
payment, each producer agrees:
    (1) When signing Form CCC-633 (Honey), Honey Loan Certification and 
Worksheet and Form CCC-677, Farm Storage Note and Security Agreement, 
that the producer will:
    (i) Provide correct, accurate, and truthful certifications and 
representations of the loan quantity and all other matters of fact and 
interest; and
    (ii) Not remove or dispose of any amount of the loan quantity 
without prior written approval from CCC in accordance with this section.
    (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of this part and Form 
CCC-677 will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed 
to the producer for a loan quantity that is not actually in existence or 
for a quantity for which the producer is not eligible.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, violations include any failure 
to comply with this part or the loan agreement, including but not 
limited to any incorrect certification or:
    (1) Unauthorized removal of honey, which shall include, but is not 
limited to, the movement of any loan quantity of honey from the storage 
structure in the commodity was stored when the loan was approved to any 
other storage structure whether or not such structure is located on the 
producer's farm without prior written authorization from the county 
committee in accordance with Sec. 1434.14;
    (2) Any unauthorized disposition, which shall include, but is not 
limited to, the conversion of any loan quantity pledged as collateral 
for a loan without prior written authorization from the county committee 
in accordance with this section.
    (c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for conduct that is in 
violation of this section. Accordingly, if the county committee 
determines that the producer has engaged in any such violation, 
liquidated damages shall be assessed in addition to any loan refund and 
other charges that may be due. The amount of such damages shall be 
computed using the quantity of honey that is involved in the violation 
and the following formula. If CCC determines the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
first offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for 
cases other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note.
    (d) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan 
quantity involved in the violation plus charges and interest; and
    (2) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days 
from the date of notification, call the applicable loan for all of the 
honey under loan, plus charges and interest.
    (e) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, the county committee

[[Page 514]]

shall call the loan involved in the violation, and charges plus 
interest.
    (f) The county committee:
    (1) May waive the administrative actions taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section if the county committee 
determines that:
    (i) The violation occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or 
unintentionally; or
    (ii) The producer acted to prevent spoilage of the commodity.
    (2) Shall not consider the following acts as inadvertent, 
accidental, or unintentional:
    (i) Movement of loan collateral off the farm;
    (ii) Movement of loan collateral from one storage structure to 
another on the farm; and (iii) Consumption of loan collateral.
    (g) If there is any violation of the loan agreement or this part, 
the loan may be terminated in which case there must be a full refund of 
the loan plus interest and costs.
    (h) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
violated this part or the loan agreement, the county committee shall 
notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to 
the county committee, and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section.
    (i)(1) If a producer:
    (i) Makes any fraudulent or misleading representation in obtaining a 
loan, maintaining, or settling a loan; or
    (ii) Disposes or moves the loan collateral without the approval of 
CCC, such loan shall become payable upon demand by CCC. The producer 
shall be liable for:
    (A) The amount of the loan;
    (B) Any additional amounts paid by CCC with respect to the loan;
    (C) All other costs that CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation, the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (D) Interest on such amounts;
    (E) Late payment interest as may be provided for in part 1403 of 
this title; and
    (F) Liquidated damages assessed under paragraph (c) of this section; 
and
    (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent or misleading 
representation to CCC or if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the 
loan collateral without prior written approval from CCC in accordance 
with this section, the value of the settlement for such collateral 
removed by CCC shall be determined by CCC according to this section.
    (j) A producer shall be personally liable for any damages resulting 
from honey removed by CCC, containing mercurial compounds or other 
substances poisonous to humans, animals, or food commodities that are 
contaminated.
    (k) If the amount disbursed under a loan or in settlement thereof 
exceeds the amount authorized under this part, the producer shall be 
personally liable for repayment of such excess and charges, plus 
interest, and for any other sanction as may be allowed by law.
    (l) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan is less than the amount required in accordance with this part, the 
producer shall be personally liable for repayment of the amount of such 
deficiency and charges, plus interest.
    (m) In the case of joint loans, the personal liability for the 
amounts specified in this section shall be joint and several on the part 
of each producer signing the loan note. Further, each producer who is a 
party to a joint loan will be jointly and severally liable for any 
violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security 
agreement, and the regulations set forth in this part. Each such 
producer shall also remain liable for repayment of the entire loan 
amount until the loan is fully repaid without regard to such producer's 
claimed share in the honey, or loan proceeds, after execution of the 
note and security agreement by CCC.
    (n) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed in accordance with 
the

[[Page 515]]

provisions of paragraph (c) of this section may be waived as determined 
by CCC.
    (o) Remedies set out in this section are in addition to remedies the 
CCC will have through its security interest on honey that secures the 
repayment of the loan made on the honey.
    (p) All remedies provided for in this section or part are in 
addition to any remedies as may otherwise be provided for in law.

    (3) When the proceeds of a sale of honey are needed to repay all or 
part of a loan, the producer must request and obtain prior written 
approval of the county office on a form prescribed by CCC in order to 
remove a specified quantity of the honey from storage. Any such approval 
shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable 
form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the county office. 
Any such approval shall not constitute a release of CCC's security 
interest in the commodity or release the producer from liability for any 
amounts due and owing to CCC with respect to any loan indebtedness if 
full payment of such amounts is not received by the county office.
    (b) The note and security agreement shall not be released until all 
loan liability has been satisfied in full.
    (c) After satisfaction of a loan, CCC shall release CCC's security 
interest in the honey at the producer's request. The producer shall be 
responsible for payment of any fee for such release if such fee can be 
determined.

paragraph (a) of this section within 30 calendar days from the maturity 
date of such loan, or other reasonable time period as established by 
CCC, a claim for the loan amount, plus charges, plus interest shall be

remove the honey from storage and assign, transfer, and deliver the 
honey or documents evidencing title thereto at such time, in such 
manner, and upon such terms as CCC may determine at public or private 
sale. Any such disposition may also be effected without removing the

    (e) Notwithstanding any provisions in this section, loan deficiency 
payments may be based on 100 percent of the net quantity specified on

<R05>
Sec. 1435.1  Applicability.

    These regulations set forth the terms and conditions for the 2002-
2007 crop years under which the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) will:
    (a) Make loans and enter agreements with eligible processors,
    (b) Collect data from sugarcane processors, sugar beet processors,

    (c) Administer sugar marketing allotments, and

[[Page 518]]

    (d) Administer an inventory disposition program to exchange CCC 
inventory for processor reductions in production.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.2  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section are applicable for all 
purposes of program administration. Terms defined in part 718 of this 
title are also applicable.
    Ability to market means, for purposes of determining the State cane 
sugar allotments and sugarcane processor allocations for Hawaii and 
Puerto Rico, the estimated quantity of sugar, raw value, as CCC 
determines, that will be produced in the cane State or by the sugarcane 
processor, as appropriate, during the applicable crop year; for 
determining the remaining State cane sugar allotments, the highest 
single year of sugar production for the State during the 1999 through 
2003 crop years; for determining the sugarcane processor allocations for 
mainland cane States other than Louisiana, the highest single year of 
sugar production for the processor during the 1999 through 2003 crop 
years; and, for determining the sugarcane processor allocations for 
Louisiana, the simple average of two amounts for each processor, 
including:
    (1) The production of sugar for the processor, stated in short tons, 
raw value, during Crop Year 2003, as determined by CCC; and
    (2) The simple average of 3 years of the processor's production of 
sugar, stated in short tons, raw value, from among the 1999 through 2003 
crop years, excluding the year in which the production was the highest 
and the year in which the production was the lowest. With respect to the 
2003 crop year, each processor's production shall be the same as 
determined under paragraph (1).
    Beet sugar means sugar that is processed directly or indirectly from 
sugar beets or sugar beet molasses.
    Beet sugar allotment means that portion of the overall allotment 
quantity allocated to sugar beet processors.
    Cane sugar means sugar derived directly or indirectly from sugarcane 
produced in the United States, including sugar produced from sugarcane 
molasses.
    Cane sugar allotment means that portion of the overall allotment

processors, sugarcane processors, cane sugar refiners, and CCC and 
physically located in the United States at the beginning of the fiscal 
year.
    Crop year means the period from October 1 through September 30, 
inclusive, and is identified by the year in which the crop year begins. 
For example, the 2002 crop year begins on October 1, 2002. The 2002 crop 
of sugar beets or sugar cane means domestically grown sugar beets or 
sugar cane processed during the 2002 crop year. The 2002 crop of sugar 
means sugar processed from domestically-grown sugar beets or sugarcane 
during the 2002 crop year. Sugar from de-sugaring molasses is considered 
to be from the crop year the de-sugaring occurred.
    Deputy Administrator means the Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, 
FSA, or designee.
    Deficit means the quantity of sugar covered by an allocation of an 
allotment that CCC estimates a sugar beet processor or sugarcane 
processor will be unable to market during the crop year in which

be allowed to have farms reconstituted across State lines even if the 
farm land is adjoining.
    Fiscal year means that year beginning October 1 and ending the 
following September 30.

[[Page 519]]

    FSA means Farm Service Agency.
    Imports means sugar originating in foreign countries or areas and 
entered, or to be entered, into the United States customs territory.
    In-process sugar means the intermediate sugar containing products, 
as CCC determines, produced in the processing of domestic sugar beets 
and sugarcane. It does not include raw sugar, liquid sugar, invert 
sugar, invert syrup, or other finished products that are otherwise 
eligible for a loan.
    Market or marketing means the transfer of title associated with the 
sale or other disposition of sugar in United States commerce, including 
the forfeiture of sugar loan collateral under Subpart B, and for any 
integrated processor and refiner, the movement of raw cane sugar into 
the refining process.
    Nonrecourse loan means a loan for which eligible sugar offered as 
loan collateral may be forfeited to CCC, at loan maturity, in 
satisfaction of loan indebtedness.
    Overall allotment quantity means, on a national basis, the total 
quantity of sugar, raw value, processed from domestically produced 
sugarcane or domestically produced sugar from sugar beets, and the raw 
value equivalent of sugar in sugar products, that is permitted to be 
marketed by processors, during a crop year or other period in which 
marketing allotments are in effect.

allotments and sugarcane processor allocations for States other than 
Louisiana, the average of the 2 highest years of sugar production during 
the 1996 through 2000 crop years; for Louisiana sugarcane processor 
allocations, the average of the 2 highest years of sugar production 
during the 1997 through 2001 crop years.
    Past processing means, for determining Hawaii and Puerto Rico's 
allotments, the 3-year average of the 1998 through 2000 crop years; and 
for determining the remaining cane State allotments, the 3 crop years 
with the greatest production (in the States collectively) during the 
1991 through 2000 crop years. Past processing, for determining the 
sugarcane processor allocation for States other than Louisiana, means 
the average of the 3 highest years of production during the 1996 through 
2000 crop years; and, for determining sugarcane processor allocations in 
Louisiana, the average of the 2 highest years of sugar production during 
the 1997 through 2001 crop years.
    Per-acre yield goal means a State's yield level that is established 
at not less than the State's two highest average per-acre yield years 
from among the 1999 through 2001 crop years as CCC determines to ensure 
an adequate net return per pound to State producers.
    Proportionate share means the total acreage from which a producer 
may harvest sugarcane for sugar or seed during any crop year or other 
period in which marketing allotments are in effect.
    Raw sugar means any sugar that is to be further refined or improved 
in quality other than in-process sugar.
    Raw value of any quantity of sugar means its equivalent in terms of 
raw sugar testing 96 sugar degrees, as determined by a polarimetric test 
performed under procedures recognized by the International Commission 
for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA). Direct-consumption sugar 
derived from sugar beets and testing 92 or more sugar degrees by the 
polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value by multiplying 
the actual number of pounds of such sugar by 1.07. Sugar derived from 
sugarcane and testing 92 sugar degrees or more by the polariscope shall 
be translated into terms of raw value in the following manner: raw value 
= {[lsqb](actual degree of polarization - 92) x 0.0175[rsqb] + 
0.93{time}  x actual weight. For sugar testing less than 92 sugar 
degrees by the polariscope, derive raw value by dividing the number of 
pounds of the ``total sugar content'' (i.e., the sum of the sucrose and 
invert sugars) thereof by 0.972.
    Reasonable carryover stocks means desirable inventories of sugar 
owned by sugar beet processors, sugarcane processors, cane sugar 
refiners, and CCC and on hand in the United States at the end of the 
fiscal year, as CCC determines.
    State means any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

[[Page 520]]

    Sugar means any grade or type of saccharine product derived, 
directly or indirectly, from sugarcane, sugar beets, sugarcane molasses 
or sugar beet molasses and consisting of, or containing, sucrose or 
invert sugar, including raw sugar, refined crystalline sugar, edible 
molasses, edible cane syrup, liquid sugar, and in-process sugar.
    Sugar beet processor means a person who commercially produces sugar, 
directly or indirectly, from sugar beets (including sugar produced from 
sugar beet molasses), has a viable processing facility, and a supply of 
sugar beets for the applicable allotment year.
    Sugar products means products for human consumption, other than 
sugar, that contain 50 percent or more of sucrose, on a dry weight 
basis, and that are marketed by a sugar beet processor or sugarcane 
processor. In determining sugar subject to marketing allocations, only 
the sugar content of such products will be counted against the 
allocation.
    Sugarcane processor means a person who commercially produces sugar, 
directly or indirectly, from sugarcane, has a viable processing 
facility, and a supply of sugarcane for the applicable allotment year.
    Ton means a short ton or 2,000 pounds.
    United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    U.S. market value means, for sugarcane, the daily New York Board of 
Trade No. 14 contract price for raw sugar, or other price, as determined 
by CCC; for sugar beets, the Midwest refined beet sugar price published 
in Milling and Baking News, or other price, as determined by CCC.
    USDA means the United States Department of Agriculture.

with CCC;
    (3) Provide quantity and quality information as prescribed by CCC of 
the commodity to be pledged as collateral;
    (4) Pay CCC a loan service fee, as determined by CCC, for the 
disbursement of each loan.
    (5) If there are any liens or encumbrances on sugar or in-process 
sugar pledged as loan collateral, obtain waivers that fully protect 
CCC's interest even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from 
the loan proceeds. No additional liens or encumbrances shall be placed 
on the sugar after loan approval; and
    (6) Agree to reimburse CCC for any costs incurred as a result of the 
failure of the processor to obtain the waivers specified in subparagraph 
(5).
    (b) No loan proceeds may be disbursed until the sugar and in-process 
sugar have actually been produced and are otherwise established as being 
eligible to be pledged as loan collateral.
    (c)(1) A processor may, within the loan availability period, 
repledge as collateral sugar that previously served as loan collateral 
for a repaid loan. In making application for such a loan, the processor 
shall:
    (i) Specify that the loan collateral should be treated as a quantity

to the actual polarity or quality factors of the sugar pledged as loan 
collateral but shall be made on the assumption that the polarity of such 
sugar is 96 degrees by the polariscope.
    (e)(1) Loans will mature at the earlier of:
    (i) the end of the 9-month period beginning on the 1st day of the

    (ii) September 30 following disbursement of the loan.
    (2) CCC may accelerate loan maturity dates under Sec. 1435.105(h).
    (f) Processors receiving loans in July, August, or September may 
repledge the sugar as collateral for a supplemental loan. Such 
supplemental loan shall:
    (1) Be requested by the processor during the following October;
    (2) Be made at the loan rate in effect at the time the supplemental 
loan is made; and

[[Page 523]]

    (1) Abide by the terms and conditions of the loan application, note 
and security agreement and storage agreement;
    (2) Pay interest on the principal at a rate determined in part 1405 
of this chapter.
    (b) The security interests CCC obtains as a result of the execution 
of security agreements by sugarcane and sugar beet processors shall be 
superior to all statutory and common law liens on raw cane sugar, 
refined beet sugar, and in-process sugar for the producers of sugarcane 
and sugar beets and all prior recorded and unrecorded liens on the crops 
of sugarcane and sugar beets from which the sugar was derived.
    (c) A processor receiving a loan under this part shall pay all 
eligible producers who have delivered or will deliver sugar beets or 
sugarcane to such processors for processing not less than the minimum 
payment levels CCC specifies for the applicable crop year.
    (1) In the case of sugar beets, the minimum payment shall not exceed 
the rate of payment provided for under the applicable contract between a 
sugar beet producer and a sugar beet processor.
    (2) CCC will not reject a loan application from a beet sugar 
processor from eligibility to obtain a loan under this section solely 
because of the failure of the processor to provide the appropriate 
minimum payment established under this subsection if the failure:
    (i) Occurred during a crop year before the date of enactment of the 
Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002; and
    (ii) Was related, at least in part, to the effects of a natural 
disaster, including freeze damage.
    (3) In the case of sugarcane, CCC will annually determine and 
announce the annual grower minimum payment.
    (4) Processors are ineligible for loans for the crop year following 
their failure to meet the required minimum grower payment.
    (d)(1) A processor shall maintain eligible sugar or in-process sugar 
of sufficient quality and quantity as collateral to satisfy the 
processor's loan indebtedness to CCC. CCC shall not assume any loss in 
quantity or quality of the loan collateral.
    (2) The processor is responsible for storage costs through the loan 
maturity date or title transfer to CCC, whichever occurs later.
    (3) Sugar and in-process sugar pledged as loan collateral need not 
be stored identity preserved.
    (4) When the proceeds of the sale of loan collateral are needed to 
repay all or part of a sugar loan, the processor may request and obtain 
prior written approval from the loan making office by executing a loan 
collateral release request, as prescribed by CCC, to remove a specified 
quantity of the loan collateral from storage for the purpose of 
delivering it to a buyer before loan repayment. Any such approval shall 
be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form. 
The loan making office shall not approve such a request unless the buyer 
of the sugar agrees to pay CCC an amount necessary to satisfy the 
processor's loan indebtedness regarding collateral being sold. Any such 
approval shall not:
    (i) Constitute a release of CCC's security interest in the loan 
collateral; or
    (ii) Relieve the processor of liability for the full amount of the 
loan indebtedness, including interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.105  Loan settlement and foreclosure.

    (a) A processor may, any time before loan maturity, redeem all or 
any part of the loan collateral by paying CCC the applicable principal 
and interest.
    (b) Forfeiture of sugar loan collateral will be accepted as payment 
in full of the principal and interest due under a nonrecourse loan, 
applicable to the quality and quantity of sugar delivered, subject to 
applicable premiums and discounts.
    (c)(1) Forfeiture of in-process sugar serving as loan collateral 
will be accepted as payment in full of principal and interest if the 
processor converts the in-process sugar into raw cane

[[Page 524]]

sugar or refined beet sugar of acceptable grade and quality for sugar 
eligible for loans within 1 month of loan maturity.
    (2) The in-process sugar must be fully processed into raw cane sugar 
or refined beet sugar, the processor shall transfer the sugar to CCC.
    (3) On transfer of the sugar, CCC shall make a payment to the 
processor in an amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the 
difference between the loan rate for raw cane sugar or refined beet 
sugar, as appropriate, and the in-process loan rate the processor 
received by the quantity of sugar transferred to CCC. The loan agreement 
shall specify the quantity of sugar that can be forfeited to CCC.
    (d) If the processor does not forfeit the collateral, but instead 
further processes the in-process sugar into raw cane sugar or refined 
beet sugar and repays the loan on the in-process sugar;
    (1) the processor may obtain a loan for the raw cane sugar or 
refined beet sugar, as appropriate, and
    (2) the term of a loan made under this subsection for a quantity of 
in-process sugar, when combined with the term of a loan made for the raw 
cane sugar or refined beet sugar derived from the in-process sugar, may 
not exceed 9 months.
    (e) CCC shall not accept delivery of sugar in settlement of a 
nonrecourse loan in excess of the quantity of sugar that is shown on the 
note and security agreement minus any quantity that was redeemed or 
released for removal under this section.
    (f) If the processor does not redeem any of the nonrecourse loan 
collateral, title to the unredeemed nonrecourse loan collateral as 
described in the note and security agreement will, without further CCC 
or processor action transfer to CCC in-store at the CCC-approved 
warehouse at 12 a.m. the day following the maturity date of the loan. 
Title, all rights, and interest to such sugar shall immediately vest in 
CCC.
    (g) The value of the settlement of loans shall be made by CCC 
according to the CCC schedule of premiums and discounts.
    (h) CCC may, at any time, accelerate the date for loan repayment 
including interest. CCC will give the processor notice of such 
acceleration at least 15 days in advance of the accelerated loan 
maturity date.
    (i) If a processor's nonrecourse loan indebtedness is not satisfied 
under the provisions of this section or if forfeited in-process sugar is 
not converted to raw or refined sugar within the prescribed time:
    (1) Interest on the processor's indebtedness shall accrue as 
specified in part 1403 of this title and shall accrue until the debt is 
paid;
    (2) CCC may, upon notice, with or without removing the collateral 
from storage, sell such collateral at either a public or private sale;
    (3) The processor shall be liable for the deficiency if the net 
proceeds are less than the amount of principal, interest, and any other 
charges CCC incurs; and
    (4) If the processor forfeits the in-process sugar loan collateral 
but does not transfer raw or refined sugar of suitable quality to CCC 
within 1 month, CCC will charge liquidated damages, as provided in the 
loan agreement.

Sec. 1435.300  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to the establishment and allocation of 
marketing allotments for:
    (1) Processor marketings of sugar domestically processed from sugar 
beets,
    (2) Processor marketings of sugar processed from domestically 
produced sugarcane,
    (3) Distribution of a processor's allocation to producers in 
proportionate share States, and
    (4) Harvesting sugarcane by producers subject to proportionate 
shares.
    (b) This subpart does not apply to:

Rico.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.301  Annual estimates and quarterly re-estimates.

    (a) Not later than August 1 before the beginning of the crop year, 
CCC will estimate, and make re-estimates as necessary but not later than 
the beginning of each quarter of such crop year, the:
    (1) Quantity of sugar that will be consumed in the United States 
(other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or 
to be refined and re-exported in refined form or in sugar-containing 
products);
    (2) Quantity of sugar that will provide for reasonable carryover 
stocks;

[[Page 526]]

    (3) Quantity of sugar that will be available for consumption from 
carry-in stocks;
    (4) Quantity of sugar that will be available for consumption from 
domestic processing of sugarcane and sugar beets; and
    (5) Quantity of sugars, syrups, and molasses that will be imported 
for human consumption or for the extraction of sugar for human 
consumption in the United States and Puerto Rico (other than sugar 
imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and 
re-exported in refined form or in sugar-containing products), whether 
such articles are included in a tariff-rate quota or not.
    (b) Calculation of all allotments, allocations, estimates, and re-
estimates in this subpart will use available USDA statistics and 
estimates of production, consumption, and stocks, taking into account, 
where appropriate, data supplied in reports submitted pursuant to the 
reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 1435.200.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.302  Establishment and suspension of allotments.

    (a) By the beginning of the crop year, CCC will establish the 
overall allotment quantity, beet sugar and cane sugar allotments, State 
cane sugar allotments, and allocations for processors marketing sugar 
domestically processed from sugar beets and domestically produced 
sugarcane at a level estimated to result in no sugar loan collateral 
forfeitures to CCC.
    (b) Marketing allotments will be suspended whenever CCC determines 
that imports of sugars, syrups, and molasses for domestic human 
consumption or to be used for the extraction of sugar for domestic human 
consumption, whether under a tariff-rate quota or not, will exceed 
1,532,000 short tons, raw value, excluding any imports attributable to a 
reassignment of allotments, and that the imports would lead to a 
reduction in the overall allotment quantity. The suspension of marketing 
allotments will be lifted if CCC subsequently determines that imports 
are estimated to be no higher than 1,532,000 short tons, raw value.
    (c) Each determination under this section to establish or suspend 
marketing allotments will be published in the Federal Register and 
accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the determination.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.303  Overall allotment quantity.

    The overall allotment quantity for the crop year will be calculated 
by deducting from the sum of estimated sugar consumption and reasonable 
carryover stocks:
    (a) 1,532,000 short tons, raw value; and
    (b) Carry-in stocks.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.304  Adjustment of the overall allotment quantity.

    (a) The overall allotment quantity will be adjusted, as CCC 
determines appropriate,
    (1) To avoid forfeiture of sugar loan collateral to CCC, and
    (2) To reflect changes in estimated consumption, stocks, production, 
or imports based on re-estimates under Sec. 1435.301.
    (b) Each determination to adjust the overall allotment quantity will 
be published in the Federal Register and accompanied by a statement of 
the reasons for the determination.
    (c) The beet sugar allotment, cane sugar allotment, State cane sugar 
allotments, proportionate shares, and allocations to each sugar beet 
processor and sugarcane processor will be increased or decreased, as 
appropriate, to reflect an overall allotment quantity adjustment.
    (d) If the overall allotment quantity is reduced under paragraph (a) 
of this section and the quantity of sugar and sugar products any 
individual processor marketed by the time of the reduction exceeds the 
processor's reduced allocation, the quantity of excess sugar or sugar 
products marketed will be deducted from the processor's allocation under 
an allotment next established.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.305  Beet and cane sugar allotments.

    (a) The allotment for beet sugar will be 54.35 percent of the 
overall allotment quantity.
    (b) The allotment for cane sugar will be 45.65 percent of the 
overall allotment quantity.
    (c) A sugar beet processor allocated a share of the beet sugar 
allotment may

[[Page 527]]

use only beet sugar to fill such allocation. A sugarcane processor 
allocated a share of the cane sugar allotment may use only cane sugar to 
fill such allocation.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.306  State cane sugar allotments.

    (a) Hawaii and Puerto Rico will be allotted a total of 325,000 short 
tons, raw value, of the cane sugar allotment.
    (b) A new entrant cane State will receive an allotment to 
accommodate a new processor's allocation under 1435.308(f).
    (c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the remaining 
cane States will be allotted, in aggregate, the remaining cane sugar 
allotment.
    (d) The individual cane State allotments, other than a new entrant 
cane State, will be based on:
    (1) Past marketings of cane sugar,
    (2) Past processing of cane sugar, and
    (3) The ability to market the sugar covered under the allotment 
assigned to the State.
    (e) Past marketings and past processings will each be weighted by 
0.25 and the ability to market will be weighted by 0.50 in determining 
the States' respective cane sugar allotments. The weights may be 
adjusted, as CCC deems appropriate, for the crop year.
    (f) Except when deficits are reassigned as provided in Sec. 
1435.309, a processor may fill an allocation of a cane sugar allotment 
only with sugar processed from sugarcane grown in the State for which 
the allotment was established.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.307  Allocation of marketing allotments to processors.

    (a) Each sugar beet processor's allocation of the beet allotment 
will be calculated as the beet processor's share times the beet sector 
allotment:
    (1) A beet processor's share is calculated as the beet processor's 
adjusted weighted average sugar production divided by the sum of all 
beet processors' adjusted weighted average sugar production.
    (2) A beet processor's weighted average sugar production equals 0.25 
times its 1998-crop sugar production plus 0.35 times its 1999-crop sugar 
production plus 0.40 times its 2000-crop sugar production, with the 2000 
sugar PIK payments added to its 2000-crop sugar production.
    (3) A beet processor's weighted average sugar production shall be 
adjusted by the following, as CCC determines:
    (i) Increased 1.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' 
weighted average sugar production for opening a sugar beet processing 
factory during the 1996 through 2000 crop years;
    (ii) Decreased 1.25 percent of the sum of beet processors' weighted 
average sugar production for closing a sugar beet processing factory 
during the 1998 through 2000 crop years:
    (iii) Increased 0.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' 
weighted average sugar production for opening a molasses desugarization 
facility during the 1998 through 2000 crop years; and
    (iv) Increased 1.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' 
weighted average sugar production for suffering a substantial quality 
loss on stored beets, as CCC determines, during the 1998 through 2000 
crop years.
    (b) Each sugarcane processors' allocation from a State cane sugar 
allotment will be calculated as the cane processor's share times the 
State cane sector allotment.
    (1) Each cane processor's share, other than a new entrant, will be 
calculated as the processor's production base divided by the sum of the 
State's processor production bases.
    (2) A processor's production base, other than a new entrants, is the 
sum of 0.50 times its ability to market plus 0.25 times its past 
processings plus 0.25 times its past marketings. These weights may be 
adjusted as CCC deems appropriate for the crop year.
    (3) CCC will calculate an allocation for the Talisman processing 
facility, based on paragraph (b)(2) of this section and distribute the 
allocation among Florida processors according to the agreements between 
cane processors and the Secretary of the Interior dated March 25, and 
March 26, 1999.
    (c) An informal hearing will be held in August of each year, if 
requested by affected sugarcane processors and growers by July 15th, to 
afford all interested persons the opportunity to comment on the next 
crop year's marketing allotments and allocations.

[[Page 528]]

After consideration of comments obtained at the hearing, a final 
determination on cane State allotments and processor allocations will be 
announced.
    (d) During any crop year in which marketing allotments are in effect 
and allocated to processors, the quantity of sugar and sugar products 
that a processor markets shall not exceed the quantity of the 
processor's allocation.
    (e) Paragraph (d) of this section shall not apply to:
    (1) Any sugar marketings to facilitate the export of sugar or sugar-
containing products;
    (2) Any sugar marketings for nonhuman consumption; and
    (3) Any processor marketings of sugar to another processor made to 
enable the purchasing processor to fulfill its allocation if such sales;
    (i) Are made before May 1, and
    (ii) Reported to CCC within 51 days of the date of sale.
    (f) Paragraph (d) of this section also shall not apply to marketings 
of purchased sugar marketed in the crop year of the purchase, but does 
apply to marketings of sugar purchased as part of a transaction pursuant 
to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (g) CCC may charge liquidated damages, as specified in a surplus 
allocation survey and agreement, on surplus allocation after the end of 
a crop year if the processor had surplus allocation because the 
processor provided incomplete or erroneous information to CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1435.308  Transfer of allocation, new entrants.

    (a) If a sugar beet or sugarcane processing facility is closed and 
the growers that delivered their crops to the closed facility elect to 
deliver their crops to another processor, the growers may petition the 
Executive Vice President, CCC, to transfer the share of allocation 
commensurate with the growers' production history from the processor 
that closed the facility to their new processor. CCC may grant the 
request to transfer the allocation upon:
    (1) Written approval of the processing company that will accept the 
additional deliveries, and
    (2) Evidence satisfactory to CCC that the new processor has the 
capacity to accommodate the production of petitioning growers.
    (b) Subject to a transfer of allocation, if any, described in 
paragraph (a) of this section being completed, CCC will permanently 
eliminate the processor's remaining allocation and distribute it to all 
other processors on a pro-rata basis when the processor:
    (1) Has been dissolved,
    (2) Has been liquidated in a bankruptcy proceeding, or
    (3) Has permanently terminated operations by:
    (i) Not processing sugarcane or sugar beets for 2 consecutive years, 
or
    (ii) Notifying CCC that the processor has permanently terminated 
operations.
    (c) If a purchaser purchasing the assets of another processor is a 
new entrant or is a processor purchasing all the assets of the selling 
processor, then CCC shall immediately transfer allocation commensurate 
with the purchased factories' production history.
    (d) If a processor does not purchase all of the assets of another 
processor, then the purchased factories must operate for the remainder 
of the initial season and the following crop year for the purchasing 
processor to permanently obtain the allocation. If the purchased 
factories do not operate for this required time period, CCC shall 
reassign the allocation to the other processors on a pro rata basis.
    (e) Allocations, equal to the number of acres of proportionate 
shares being transferred times the State's per-acre yield goal, will be 
transferred between mills in proportionate share States, if the 
transfers are based on:
    (1) Written consent of the crop-share owners, or their 
representatives,
    (2) Written consent of the processing company holding the allocation 
for the subject proportionate shares,
    (3) Written consent of the processing company that will accept the 
additional sugarcane deliveries, and
    (4) Evidence, satisfactory to CCC, that the additional sugarcane 
deliveries will not exceed the processing capacity of the receiving 
company.
    (f) New entrants, not acquiring existing facilities with production 
history

[[Page 529]]

in the base period, may apply to the Executive Vice President, CCC, for 
an allocation.
    (1) Applicants must demonstrate their ability to process, produce, 
and market sugar for the applicable crop year.
    (2) CCC will consider adverse effects of the allocation upon 
existing processors and producers.
    (3) New entrant cane processors are limited to 50,000 short tons, 
raw value, the first crop year.
    (4) New entrant cane processors will be provided, as determined by 
CCC:
    (i) A share of their State's cane allotment if the processor is 
located in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, or Texas, or
    (ii) A share of the overall cane allotment if the processor is 
located in any state not listed in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) CCC will conduct a hearing on a new entrant application if an 
interested processor or grower requests a hearing.
    (6) If a new entrant acquires and reopens a factory that previously 
produced beet sugar from sugar beets and sugar beet molasses, but the 
factory last operated during the 1997 crop year, CCC will:
    (i) Assign an allocation to the new entrant not less than the 
greater of 1.67 percent of the adjusted weighted average quantities of 
beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop 
years, as determined under Sec. 1435.307, or 1,500,000 hundredweight.
    (ii) Reduce all other beet processor allocations on a pro rata 
basis.

<R05>
Sec. 1435.309  Reassignment of deficits.

    (a) CCC will determine, from time to time, whether sugar beet or 
sugarcane processors will be unable to market their allocations.
    (b) Sugar beet and sugar cane processors will report to CCC current 
inventories, estimated production, expected marketings, and any other 
pertinent factors CCC deems appropriate to determine a processor's 
ability to market their allocation.
    (c) If CCC determines a sugarcane processor will be unable to market 
its full allocation for the crop year in which an allotment is in 
effect, the deficit will be reassigned by June 1:
    (1) First, to allocations of other sugarcane processors within that 
State based on each processor's initial allocation share of the State's 
allotment, but no processor may receive reassigned allocation such that 
its allocation exceeds its estimated total sugar supply.
    (2) If the deficit cannot be eliminated after reassignment within 
the same State, be reassigned to the other cane States based on each 
State's initial share of the cane sugar allotment, but no State may 
receive reassigned State allotment such that its allocation exceeds its 
estimated total sugar supply, with the reassigned quantity to each State 
being allocated according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) If CCC determines that a sugar beet processor is unable to 
market its full allocation for the crop year in which an allotment is in 
effect, the deficit will:
    (1) First, be reassigned proportionately to allocations of other 
sugar beet processors, depending on the capacity of other processors to 
fill the portion of the deficit to be reassigned to them, accounting for 
the interests of associated producers.
    (2) If the deficit cannot be eliminated by paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, be reassigned to CCC. CCC shall sell such quantity from 
inventory unless CCC determines such sales would have a significant 
effect on the sugar price.
    (3) If any portion of the deficit remains after paragraphs (d)(1) 
and (d)(2) of this section have been implemented, be reassigned to 
imports.
    (e) The crop year allocation of each sugar beet or sugarcane 
processor who receives a reassignment will be increased accordingly for 
that year.

69 FR 58037, Sept. 29, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 1435.310  Sharing processors' allocations with producers.

    (a) Every sugar beet and sugarcane processor must provide CCC a 
certification that:

[[Page 530]]

    (1) The processor intends to share its allocation among its 
producers fairly and equitably, and in a manner adequately reflecting 
each producer's production history, and
    (2) The processor has, in the previous allotment year, shared its 
allocation among producers fairly and equitably, reflecting each 
producer's production history. If a processor is unable to provide such 
certification, CCC may reduce or eliminate its marketing allocation.
    (b) CCC will determine that a processor in a proportionate share 
state has met the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section if the 
processor establishes a grower payment plan that incorporates the 
following provisions:
    (1) Pays growers for sugar from their delivered sugarcane in the 
following priority:
    (i) Sugar production from proportionate share acreage; as 
established under Sec. 1435.311, for producers determined by CCC, who;
    (A) Delivered to the mill in at least one of the crop years 1999, 
2000, or 2001,
    (B) Obtained an allocation transfer from a predecessor mill, or
    (C) Have been designated by the mill to supply sugarcane replacing 
sugarcane lost to the mill since the 2001 crop year,
    (ii) Sugar production from base acreage, as established under Sec. 
1435.312, but exclusive of the acreage described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section, for producers who meet the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, then
    (iii) All other sugar production.
    (2) If a mill cancels a producer's contract, the mill must permit 
the producer to move an allocation commensurate with the producer's 
production history to a mill of the producer's choice.
    (3) In determining the payment priority, a processor may aggregate 
the acreage of an operator (producer making the crop production 
decisions) across all the operator's farms delivering cane to the 
processor.
    (c) CCC will determine that a processor not in a proportionate share 
state, which is cooperatively owned by producers, has met the conditions 
of paragraph (a) of this section if the processor shares its allocation 
with its producers according to its cooperative membership agreement.
    (d) CCC will disclose farm base and reported acres data in a 
proportionate share state to processors upon their request for growers 
delivering to their mill. In the case of multiple producers on a farm or 
growers delivering to more than one mill, subject mills will be 
responsible for coordinating proportionate share data.
    (e) Any producer or processor may request arbitration of a dispute 
regarding the sharing of the processor's allocation among the producers. 
Arbitration will be available on behalf of CCC at the State FSA office 
for the State in which the processor is located. Subsequent review of 
the arbitration decision is available at the discretion of the Executive 
Vice President, CCC. Any arbitration is subject to appeal to the Office 
of the Administrative Law Judge, USDA.

<R05>
Sec. 1435.311  Proportionate shares for sugarcane producers.

    (a) Proportionate shares and the provisions of this section and 
Sec. Sec. 1435.312 through 1435.316 apply only to Louisiana sugarcane 
farms.
    (b) CCC will determine whether Louisiana sugar production, in the 
absence of proportionate shares, will exceed the quantity needed to 
enable processors to fill the State cane sugar allotment and provide a 
normal carryover inventory. If the determination is made that the 
quantity of sugar produced in Louisiana, plus a normal carryover 
inventory, will exceed the State's allotment, CCC will establish for 
each sugarcane producing farm a proportionate share that limits the 
sugarcane acreage that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed.
    (c) For purposes of determining proportionate shares CCC will:
    (1) Establish the State's per-acre yield goal at a level not less 
than the average per-acre yield in the State for the 2 highest years 
from among the 1999 through 2001 crop years;
    (2) Adjust the per-acre yield goal by the State average recovery 
rate;

[[Page 531]]

    (3) Convert the State cane sugar allotment into a State acreage 
allotment by dividing the State allotment by the adjusted per-acre yield 
goal;
    (4) Establish a uniform reduction percentage for the crop by 
dividing the State acreage allotment by the sum of all adjusted acreage 
bases in the State as determined under Sec. 1435.312; and
    (5) Apply the uniform reduction percentage to the acreage base 
established for each sugarcane producing farm in the State to determine 
the farm's proportionate share of sugarcane acreage that may be 
harvested for sugar or seed.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.312  Establishment of acreage bases under proportionate shares.

    (a) CCC will establish a sugarcane crop acreage base for each farm 
subject to proportionate shares as the simple average of the acreage 
planted and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed on the farm 
in the 2 highest of the 1999 through 2001 crop years. Acreage considered 
planted shall be determined under Sec. 1435.315.
    (b) In establishing crop acreage bases, CCC will:
    (1) Not consider acreage prevented from planting, and
    (2) Consider acreage planted to sugarcane that fails.
    (c) In establishing crop acreage bases, CCC will allow producers who 
have not previously reported their sugarcane acreage to do so by a date 
CCC determines and announces. Late-filed acreage reports will be 
accepted as the Deputy Administrator determines appropriate.
    (d) The farm's crop acreage base shall be used to determine the 
farm's proportionate share.
    (e) The regulations at part 718 of this title shall apply to this 
subpart, except reconstitution of farms with a sugar crop acreage base 
shall not be allowed across State lines.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.313  Permanent transfer of acreage base histories under 
proportionate shares.

    (a) A sugarcane producer on a farm may transfer all or a portion of 
the producer's acreage base history of land owned, operated, or 
controlled to any other farm in the State that the producer owns, 
operates, or controls under the Deputy Administrator-issued 
instructions. The transfer will reduce permanently the transferring 
farm's sugarcane acreage base history and increase the receiving farm's 
crop acreage base.
    (b) All farm owners must agree in writing to the transfer.
    (c) Producers may transfer sugarcane acreage base histories under 
this section by the date the State FSA committee establishes annually.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.314  Temporary transfer of proportionate share due to disasters.

    (a) If, for reasons beyond the control of a producer on a farm, such 
producer is unable to harvest sugarcane acreage relative to all or a 
portion of the proportionate share established for the farm, the 
Secretary may preserve, on producer application and written consent of 
all owners of the farm, for a period of not more than 5 consecutive 
years, the acreage base history of the farm to the extent of the 
proportionate share involved.
    (b) Such proportionate share may be transferred, with the written 
consent of all owners of the farm, for 1 crop year to other farm owners 
or operators subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The acreage base history of the transferring farm will be 
preserved for a period from 1 to 5 years; and
    (2) Acreage base history will not be increased on the receiving 
farm.
    (c) Producers who transfer a proportionate share under this section 
will be required to:
    (1) Initiate the transfer in the county FSA office where the 
proportionate shares are established; and
    (2) Obtain approval from the transferring county FSA committee.
    (d) All transfers made under this section must be completed by the 
date the State FSA committee establishes.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.315  Adjustments to proportionate shares.

    Whenever CCC determines that, because of a natural disaster or other 
condition beyond the control of producers adversely affecting a 
sugarcane crop, the amount of sugarcane produced by producers subject to 
proportionate shares will not be sufficient to

[[Page 532]]

enable state processors to produce sufficient sugar to meet the State's 
cane sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover of sugar, CCC may 
uniformly allow producers to harvest sugarcane in excess of their 
proportionate shares, or suspend proportionate shares entirely.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.316  Acreage reports for purposes of proportionate shares.

    (a) A report of planted and failed acreage shall be required on 
farms that produce sugarcane for sugar or seed. Such report shall also 
specify the total acreage intended for harvest for sugar and seed.
    (b) The reports required under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
be on forms prescribed by CCC and shall be filed annually with the 
county FSA committee by the applicable final reporting date CCC 
establishes. The farm operator or farm owner shall file such reports.
    (c) Acreage reports will be used to determine compliance with 
proportionate shares and acreage bases for future proportionate shares.
    (d) An acreage report may be accepted after the established date for 
reporting if physical evidence is still available for inspection that 
may be used to make a determination relative to:
    (1) Existence of the crop;
    (2) Use made of the crop;
    (3) Lack of crop; or
    (4) Disaster condition affecting the crop.
    (e) The farm operator shall pay the cost of a farm visit by an 
authorized FSA employee unless the county FSA committee has determined 
that failure to report in a timely manner was beyond the producer's 
control.
    (f) The farm operator may revise an acreage report. Revised reports 
shall be filed in accordance with CCC instructions and shall be accepted 
at any time if:
    (1) Evidence exists for inspection and determination of:
    (i) Existence of the crop;
    (ii) Use made of the crop;
    (iii) Lack of crop; or
    (iv) Disaster condition affecting the crops.
    (2) The farm has not already been inspected and the acreage already 
determined or harvesting of sugarcane already begun.
    (g) Provisions of part 718 of this chapter will apply for field 
inspections, tolerance, and variance. Assessments for false acreage 
reporting will be applied under Sec. 1435.318.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.317  Revisions of allocations and proportionate shares.

    The Executive Vice President, CCC, may modify any processor's 
allocation or any producer's proportionate share on the same basis as 
the initial allocation or proportionate share was required to be 
established.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.318  Penalties and assessments.

    (a) Under Sec. 359b(c)(3) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, as amended, any sugar beet or sugarcane processor who knowingly 
markets sugar or sugar products in excess of the processor's allocation 
in violation of Sec. 1435.307 shall be liable to CCC for a civil 
penalty in an amount equal to 3 times the U.S. market value, at the time 
the violation was committed, of that quantity of sugar involved in the 
violation.
    (b) Under Sec. 359f(c)(5) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, as amended, any producer of sugarcane whose farm has a 
proportionate share, and who knowingly harvests or allows to be 
harvested an acreage of sugarcane for sugar or seed in excess of the 
farm's proportionate share shall pay to CCC a civil penalty in an amount 
equal to 1.5 times the U.S. market value of the quantity of sugar that 
is marketed by the processor of such sugarcane in excess of the 
allocation of such processor, for the year in which the violation was 
committed. However, civil penalties will not be assessed when the 
producer harvests acreage for sugar or seed in excess of the farm's 
proportionate share, if the excess sugarcane harvested is:
    (1) Processed by a sugarcane processor that does not exceed its 
marketing allocation; or
    (2) Diverted to a use other than sugar or seed if:
    (i) The sugarcane producer requests and pays for a CCC field 
inspection, and
    (ii) CCC verifies the disposition of the excess harvest is not for 
sugar or seed.

[[Page 533]]

    (c) Any penalty assessed under paragraph (b) of this section shall 
be prorated among the producers of all sugarcane acquired by the 
processor from excess acres.
    (d) Any person filing a false acreage report that exceeds tolerance 
will be subject to an assessment not to exceed $10,000. Whenever the 
failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions 
applicable to proportionate shares would result in an assessment, the 
Deputy Administrator may authorize the waiver or reduction of the 
assessment in such amounts as determined to be equitable about the 
seriousness of the failure, the producer's good-faith effort to comply 
fully with such terms and conditions, and the producer's substantial 
performance.
    (e) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this subpart 
other than paragraph (d) of this section is subject to the assessment of 
a civil penalty by CCC of not more than $5,000 for each violation.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.319  Appeals and arbitration.

    (a) A person adversely affected by any determination made under this 
subpart may request reconsideration of such determination by filing a 
written request with the Executive Vice President, CCC, detailing the 
basis of the request within 10 days of such determination. Such a 
request must be submitted at: Executive Vice President, CCC, Stop 0501, 
1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250-0501.
    (b) For issues arising under section 359d establishing allocations 
for marketing allotments, and sections 359f(b) and (c), and section 359i 
of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, after completion 
of the process provided in paragraph (a) of this section, a person 
adversely affected by a reconsidered determination may appeal such 
determination by filing a written notice of appeal within 20 days of the 
issuance of the reconsidered determination with the Hearing Clerk, USDA, 
Room 1081, South Building, 1400 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 
20250-9200. Any hearing conducted under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with instructions issued by USDA's Judicial Officer.
    (c) For issues arising under Sec. Sec. 359a-359c, 359e, and 359g of 
the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, after completion of 
the process provided in paragraph (a) of this section, a person 
adversely affected by the reconsidered determination may appeal such 
determination by filing a written notice of appeal with the Director, 
National Appeals Division, USDA, as provided in part 11 of this title. 
For issues arising under Sec. 359f(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment 
Act of 1938, as amended, such disputes shall be resolved through 
arbitration under the direction of the Executive Vice President, CCC. A 
request for arbitration must be filed in writing at the address 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

         Subpart E_Processor Sugar Payment-In-Kind (PIK) Program


<R05>
Sec. 1435.400  General statement.

    This subpart shall be applicable to sugar beet and sugarcane 
processors throughout the United States who, acting in conjunction with 
the producers of the sugarcane or sugar beets processed by the 
processors, reduce sugar production in return for a payment of sugar 
from CCC when CCC determines that such action will reduce forfeitures of 
sugar pledged as collateral for a CCC loan.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.401  Bid submission procedures.

    (a) After announcement by CCC that a program authorized by this 
subpart is in effect, processors who desire to participate in the 
program must submit a bid to CCC, on a form prescribed by CCC, that 
specifies:
    (1) For a program involving acreage diversion, the amount of acreage 
to be reduced by producers who have contracts for delivery of sugar 
beets or sugar cane to the processor and contains the information CCC 
determines necessary to conduct the program and includes but is not 
limited to:
    (i) The number of acres that the processor, acting in conjunction 
with the producers, will divert;

[[Page 534]]

    (ii) The previous consecutive 3-year simple average sugar beet or 
sugarcane yield on that acreage while under contract (years with no 
production contracted with a producer will not be considered (for first-
time producers, however, the previous consecutive 3-year simple average 
sugar beet or sugarcane yield for all the producers under contract who 
delivered to the applicable factory will be used);
    (iii) The previous 3-year simple average sugar content of the 
producer's beets or sugarcane (for first-time producers, the previous 3-
year simple average sugar content for all beets or cane delivered to 
that factory will be used);
    (iv) The processor's previous 3-year simple average recovery rate 
(for processors that have not been fully operational during the last 3 
years, the simple average for those years that they were fully 
operational);
    (v) The value of CCC sugar to be received as payment; and
    (vi) Other information CCC deems necessary for program 
administration; or
    (2) The sugar production capacity to be removed from production by 
the processor.
    (b) The following acreage is ineligible for enrollment in the PIK 
program:
    (1) If planted, acreage not currently under contract for delivery of 
sugar beets to a sugar beet processor or sugarcane to a sugarcane 
processor for sugar production.
    (2) If planted, acreage that is not harvestable,
    (3) Acreage devoted to roads or other non-producing areas, or
    (4) If planted, acreage on which a crop insurance indemnity or 
replant payment was received for the current crop or for which a claim 
has been, or will be, filed to receive a crop insurance indemnity or 
replant payment for the current crop, except for replant payments for 
acreage actually replanted before the end of the normal planting period.
    (c) If planted, the diverted acres cannot be grazed until after the 
sugar beets or sugarcane are destroyed by disking, plowing, or other 
means of mechanical destruction. In addition, the sugar beets or 
sugarcane on the diverted acres may not be used for any commercial 
purpose.
    (d) The acreage offered must meet the following requirements:
    (1) If less than or equal to 15 acres, then the acreage bid must 
consist of one of the following:
    (i) One contiguous area of land,
    (ii) One or more entire permanent fields, or
    (iii) One or more entire permanent fields and one contiguous area of 
land to complete the balance;
    (2) If more than 15 acres, then the acreage bid must consist of one 
of the following:
    (i) One or more areas of land of at least 15 contiguous acres each 
with one remaining area of land of less than 15 contiguous acres to 
complete the balance,
    (ii) One or more entire permanent fields, or
    (iii) One or more entire permanent fields and one area of contiguous 
land to complete the balance.
    (3) Contiguous areas of land must have a minimum width of 3 chains 
(198 feet).
    (e) For a program involving desugaring capacity, or other measures 
of sugar production, not involving acreage diversion, the bid must 
contain the information CCC determine necessary to conduct the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.402  Bid selection procedures.

    (a) For bids in which the processor offers to remove acreage of 
sugar beets or sugarcane from production, CCC will rank bids on the 
basis of the bid amount as a percentage of the expected sugar produced 
from the retired acreage. Bids with the lowest of such percentages will 
be selected first. In the case of identical bids, selection may be based 
on random selection or pro rata shares, as CCC deems appropriate.
    (b) CCC will reject bids for which the bid amounts exceed the 
expected sugar produced from the retired acreage.
    (c) For bids in which the processor offers to remove sugar 
production capacity from production, CCC will rank the bids on the basis 
of the capacity to be removed from production.
    (d) All acceptable bids specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
section will be further reviewed by CCC and

[[Page 535]]

ranked in order of the greatest reduction in sugar program that can be 
achieved at the lowest cost to CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.403  In-kind payments.

    (a) CCC will, through such methods as CCC deems appropriate, make 
payments in the form of sugar held in CCC inventory.
    (b) To the maximum extent practicable, CCC will use its inventory in 
making an in-kind payment based on the following priority:
    (1) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by the processor;
    (2) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by any other processor in the 
same region as the producer;
    (3) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by any other processor that is 
not in the same region as the producer; and
    (4) CCC-owned sugar held in storage anywhere in the United States, 
if CCC determines that such sugar is eligible to be used for in-kind 
payments.
    (c) The value of CCC-owned inventory is dependent upon the storage 
location of the sugar and the type of sugar (raw or refined). CCC will 
announce the value of its inventory before bid solicitation. 
Accordingly, the quantity of sugar CCC will provide in terms of an in-
kind payment to a processor will be determined by dividing:
    (1) The total of the processor's bid amount that CCC accepts, by
    (2) The value of CCC's inventory at the storage location at which 
title will transfer from CCC to the processor.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.404  Timing of distribution of CCC-owned sugar.

    Distribution of sugar from CCC inventory will occur in such manner 
as CCC determines appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.405  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) CCC may permit processors to bid, in lieu of acreage, 
desugarizing capacity or other measures of sugar production as CCC 
determines.
    (b) The contract shall provide for the payment of liquidated damages 
if a processor fails to comply with the obligations specified in the CCC 
production diversion contract.
    (c) CCC will transfer title of the sugar to the processor by 
notifying the processor or assignee that the sugar is available. CCC 
will stop storage payments on this sugar on the date of transfer.

Sec. 1436.1  Applicability.

    The regulations of this part provide the terms and conditions under 
which CCC may provide low-cost financing for producers to build or 
upgrade on-farm storage and handling facilities. Because liens and 
security interests related to this activity may be governed by state 
law, CCC may adapt certain procedures relating to those issues that may 
vary between States.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.2  Administration.

    (a) The Farm Storage Facility Loan Program shall be administered 
under the general supervision of the Executive Vice President, CCC or

question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any 
determination made by the State or FSA county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize 
State and FSA county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other 
program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such 
other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the Farm 
Storage Facility Loan Program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute Farm Storage Facility Loan 
Program applications and related documents only under the terms and 
conditions determined and announced by CCC. Any such document that is 
not executed in accordance with such terms and conditions, including any 
purported execution prior to the date authorized by CCC, shall be void.
    (g) The Deputy Administrator may suspend this program at any time 
when it appears that there is no shortage of storage that needs to be 
addressed or where some other reason shall arise for which it appears 
that the program goals can be achieved more efficiently in a manner 
different from that provided for in this rule.

soybeans, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, safflower, flaxseed, mustard 
seed, other oilseeds as determined and announced by CCC, dry peas, 
lentils, small chickpeas, harvested as whole grain and including 
peanuts, except that corn, grain sorghum, oats, wheat, or barley shall 
be included whether harvested as whole grain or other than whole grain.
    Financing statement means the appropriate document that gives legal 
notice of a security interest in personal property when properly filed 
or recorded.
    Non-movable or non-salable collateral means either collateral the

applicant's share of the acres farmed for each facility loan commodity 
requiring storage at the proposed facility multiplied by a yield 
determined reasonable by the county committee, multiplied by two, less 
existing storage capacity. If acreage data is not available, including 
prevented planted acres, or the data is not applicable to the storage 
need, a reasonable acreage projection may be made for newly acquired 
farms, changes in cropping operations, or for facility loan commodity 
crops being grown for the first time.
    (2) For sugar-related loans, a projection from the processor of the 
processing volume, available storage capacity, volume not to be marketed 
due to marketing allotments, and other factors affecting the processor's 
storage need, as appropriate. CCC shall determine if the storage need is 
reasonable using data such as past processing volume and marketing 
allotments.
    Subordination agreement means any agreement under which a party may 
subordinate a security interest in property to the interest of another 
party.
    Uniform Commercial Code means the laws generally known by that name

Sec. 1436.7  Loan term.

    The maximum term of the loan shall be 7 years from the date a 
promissory note and security agreement are executed, except in the case 
of a sugar-related loan in which case CCC, at its discretion, may 
authorize a loan of 15 years. The minimum term of a sugar-related loan 
is 7 years. No extensions of

[[Page 540]]

the loan term will be granted. The loan balance and all related costs 
are due 7 years from the date of the execution of the promissory note 
and security agreement, except in the cast of a sugar-related loan, in 
which case such balance and costs are due 15 years from the date of the 
promissory note and security agreement are executed.

[67 FR 54939, Aug. 26, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1436.8  Security for loan.

    (a) Except as agreed to by CCC, all loans shall be secured by a 
promissory note and security agreement covering the farm storage 
facility. The promissory note and security agreement shall grant CCC a 
security interest in the collateral and shall be perfected in the manner 
specified in the laws of the state where the collateral is located. 
CCC's security interest in the collateral shall constitute the sole 
security interest in such collateral except for prior liens on the 
underlying realty that by operation of law attach to the collateral if 
it is or will become a fixture. If any such prior lien on the realty 
will attach to the collateral, a severance agreement must be obtained in 
writing from each holder of such a lien, including all government or 
USDA agencies. No additional liens or encumbrances may be placed on the 
storage facility after the loan is approved unless CCC approves 
otherwise in writing.
    (b) For loan amounts exceeding $50,000, or where the aggregate 
outstanding loan balance will exceed $50,000 or for loans where the 
approving committee determines as a result of financial analysis that 
additional security is required, a lien on the real estate parcel on 
which the farm storage facility is located will be required in the form 
of a real estate mortgage, deed of trust, or other security instrument 
approved by the United States Department of Agriculture's Office of 
General Counsel. CCC's interest in the real estate shall be superior to 
all other liens and is the first lien that secures the amount of the 
loan. A loan will be considered to be adequately secured when the real 
estate security for the loan is at least equal to the loan amount. If 
the real estate is covered by a prior lien, a lien waiver may be 
obtained by means of a subordination agreement approved for use in the 
State by USDA's Office of General Counsel. CCC will not require such an 
agreement from any agency of the Department of Agriculture. Loans may be 
secured by a junior lien on real estate when the loan is adequately 
secured and a severance agreement is obtained from prior lien holders.
    (c) Title insurance or a title opinion is required for loans secured 
by real estate.
    (d) Real estate liens may cover land separate from the collateral if 
a lien on the underlying real estate is not feasible and if:
    (1) The borrower owns the separate acreage; and
    (2) the acreage has sufficient value based on the fair market value 
of the acreage at the time of the application as determined by the 
county committee, to insure repayment of the loan.
    (e) Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this section, a 
borrower, in lieu of such liens as are otherwise required by those 
subsections, may provide a letter of credit, bond, or other form of 
security, as approved by CCC.
    (f) If an existing structure is remodeled and an addition becomes an 
attached, integral part of the existing storage structure, CCC's 
security interest shall include the existing storage structure.
    (g) The cost of loan closings by attorneys, title opinions, title 
insurance, title searches, filing and recording all real estate liens, 
fixture filings and later subordinations will be paid by the borrower. 
CCC shall pay such costs relating to credit reports, collateral lien 
searches, and filing and recording financing statements for the 
collateral.
    (h) For sugar-related facility loans, in addition to the above 
requirements, additional security, including real estate, chattels, 
crops in storage, and other assets owned by the applicant, is required 
if necessary to adequately secure the loan. A sugar-related loan will be 
considered to be adequately secured when the CCC determined value of 
security for the loan is at least equal to 125 percent of the loan 
amount.
    (i) For sugar-related facility loans, paragraph (g) is not 
applicable. The

[[Page 541]]

borrower shall pay all loan making fees and closing costs. This 
includes, but is not limited to, attorney fees for loan closings, 
environmental assessments and studies, chattel and real estate 
appraisals, title opinions, title insurance, title searches, filing and 
recording all real estate liens, fixture filings, subordinations, credit 
reports, collateral lien searches, and filing and recording financing 
statements for the collateral.

<R05>
Sec. 1436.9  Loan amount and loan application approvals.

    (a) The cost on which the loan shall be based is the net cost of the 
eligible facility, accessories, and services to the applicant after 
discounts and rebates, not to exceed a maximum per-bushel cost 
established by the FSA State committee.
    (b) The net cost for storage facilities and handling equipment may 
include the following: all real estate lien related fees paid by the 
borrower, including attorney fees, except for filing fees, environmental 
and historic review fees including archaeological study fees, the 
facility purchase price, sales tax, shipping, delivery charges, site 
preparation costs, installation cost, material and labor for concrete 
pads and foundations, material and labor for electrical wiring, 
electrical motors, off-farm paid labor, on farm site preparation and 
construction equipment costs not to exceed commercial rates approved by 
the county committee, and new on-farm material approved by the county 
committee. The net cost shall not include secondhand material or any 
other item that is determined by the approving authority to be 
ineligible for loan.
    (c) The maximum principal amount of any farm storage facility loan 
shall be 85 percent of the net cost of the applicant's needed storage or 
handling equipment not to exceed $100,000 for each borrower signing the 
note and security agreement. Unless otherwise approved by CCC, borrowers 
shall be considered to be separate persons or borrowers for purposes of 
applying the preceding sentence only to the extent that they would 
normally be considered a separate person under the rules set out in 7 
CFR part 1400.
    (d) The aggregate outstanding balance of all facility loans for any 
one borrower signing the note and security agreement may not exceed 
$100,000.
    (e) When a storage structure has a larger capacity than the 
applicant's needed capacity, as determined by CCC, the net cost eligible 
for a loan shall be prorated. Only costs associated with the applicant's 
needed storage capacity will be considered eligible for loan under this 
part.
    (f) When a flat storage structure has space that is not used 
primarily for facility loan commodity storage, such as office space, the 
loan amount shall be adjusted for the ineligible space as determined by 
CCC.
    (g) The FSA county committee may approve applications, if loan funds 
are available, up to the maximum approval amount unless the FSA State 
committee establishes a lower limit for county committee approval 
authority.
    (h) Farm storage facility loan approvals will expire in 4 months 
after the date of approval unless extended in writing for an additional 
4 months by the FSA State Committee. Sugar storage facility loan 
approvals will expire in 8 months after the date of approval unless 
extended in writing for an additional 4 months by the FSA State 
Committee.
    (i) CCC may at any time refuse to make new loans.
    (j) For sugar-related facility loans, paragraphs (c) and (d) and (g) 
do not apply.
    (k) For sugar-related facility loans, the Agency approval officials 
may only approve loans, subject to available funds.

<R05>
Sec. 1436.10  Down payment.

    (a) A minimum down payment representing the difference between the 
net cost of the storage facility and the amount of the loan determined 
in accordance with Sec. 1436.9 shall be made by the loan applicant to 
the supplier or contractor before the loan is disbursed.
    (b) The down payment shall be in cash unless some other form of 
payment is approved by CCC. The down

[[Page 542]]

payment may be obtained by the borrower from another lending source.
    (c) The down payment may not include any trade-in, discount, rebate, 
credit, deferred payment, post-dated check, or promissory note to the 
supplier or contractor.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.11  Disbursement and assignments.

    (a) Disbursement of the loan by CCC will be made after the farm 
storage facility has been delivered, erected, constructed, assembled, or 
installed and a CCC representative has inspected and approved such 
facility.
    (b) Disbursement will be made only if the borrower furnishes 
satisfactory evidence of the total cost of the facility and payment of 
all debts on the facility in excess of the amount of the loan.
    (c) Disbursement may be made jointly to the borrower and the 
contractor or supplier, except disbursement may be made to the borrower 
only if CCC determines the borrower has paid the contractor or supplier 
all amounts that are due and owing with respect to the facility and that 
all applicable liens, security interests, or other encumbrances have 
been released.
    (d) A release of liability will be required from contractors and 
suppliers providing goods and services to the loan applicant.
    (e) Loan proceeds cannot be assigned.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.12  Interest and fees.

    (a) Loans shall bear interest at the rate equivalent, as determined 
by CCC, to the rate of interest charged on Treasury securities of 
comparable maturity on the date the loan is approved.
    (b) The interest rate for each loan will remain in effect for the 
term of the loan.
    (c) The loan applicant shall pay a non-refundable application fee in 
such amount determined appropriate by CCC, which fee may not in any case 
be less then $45.
    (d) For sugar-related facility loans, paragraph (c) does not apply.

[66 FR 4612, Jan. 18, 2001, as amended at 67 FR 54939, Aug. 26, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1436.13  Loan installments, delinquency, and acceleration of 
maturity date.

    (a) Equal installments of principal plus interest will be amortized 
over the loan term for purposes of setting a payment schedule. 
Installments are due and payable not later than the last day of each 12-
month period of the loan, until the principal plus interest has been 
paid in full.
    (b) Each installment may be paid in cash, money order, wire 
transfer, or by personal, certified, or cashier's check. Repayment shall 
be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal.
    (c) The following actions will be taken when installments are not 
paid on the due date: A demand for payment shall be mailed to the debtor 
after the due date has passed. If the installment is not paid within 30 
days of the due date or if a new due date acceptable to CCC has not been 
established based on a financial plan submitted by the debtor, the 
initial demand may be followed by two subsequent written demands at 
approximately 30-day intervals unless other action is needed to protect 
the interests of CCC. If the debtor files an appeal according to Sec. 
1436.18 of this part, collection action shall cease until the appeal 
process is complete, however, any payments due the debtor may be 
withheld and, depending on the outcome of the appeal, may later be 
offset and applied to reduce the indebtedness. In lieu of a foreclosure 
on the collateral in the case of a delinquency, CCC may permit a 
rescheduling of the debt or other measures consistent with the 
collection of other debts under the provisions of Part 1403. 
Alternately, CCC may implement such other collection procedures as it 
deems appropriate.
    (d) A claim shall be established against a borrower for any amounts 
remaining due after liquidation of the loan.
    (e) CCC may declare the entire indebtedness immediately due and 
payable if the borrower violates any of the terms and conditions of this 
part, fails to pay any installment on time, or breaches any of the terms 
and conditions of any of the instruments executed in connection with the 
loan, or if , during the life of the loan, the collateral is used in 
connection with or by

[[Page 543]]

any unauthorized commercial operation including, but not limited to, 
elevators, warehouses, dryers or processing plants.
    (f) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be 
taken:
    (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity 
that the borrower participates in, either directly or indirectly, as 
determined by CCC.
    (2) Against related persons or entities, irrespective of the debtors 
share, when CCC determines that the debtor has established an entity, or 
reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other manner, 
their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the debt.
    (g) The loan may be paid in full or in part without penalty at any 
time before maturity.
    (h) Upon payment of a loan, CCC shall release CCC's security 
interest in the collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.14  Taxes.

    The borrower must pay, when due, all real and personal property 
taxes that may affect CCC's security interest in all collateral securing 
the note evidencing the loan. To protect its interests, CCC may pay any 
unpaid taxes with respect to the collateral securing a loan made in 
accordance with this part, and if CCC does so, the borrower shall 
reimburse CCC for such payment, and if unpaid by the borrower, such debt 
shall become due immediately.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.15  Maintenance, liability, insurance, and inspections.

    (a) The borrower must maintain the loan collateral in a condition 
suitable for the storage of one or more of the facility loan 
commodities. For purpose of this section the term ``loan collateral'' 
shall mean any property of any kind that was built or improved, or 
acquired using a loan made under this part.
    (b) Until the loan has been repaid, the borrower shall be liable for 
all damages to or destruction of the loan collateral. CCC shall not 
assume any loss of the loan collateral.
    (c) CCC may conduct annual collateral inspections to insure 
compliance with this part. The borrower must consent to such inspection 
as a term of the loan and failure to supply such access shall put the 
borrower into default.
    (d) Structures must be insured against all perils in all cases and 
must also be insured against flooding if the structure is located in a 
flood plain, as determined by CCC. Proof of flood insurance, if 
required, and proof of all peril structural insurance, must be provided 
to CCC annually. CCC must be listed as a loss payee on all peril and 
flood insurance policies.
    (e) CCC shall have rights of ingress and egress where the facility 
is located. Failure of the borrower to secure such access will render a 
borrower ineligible for the loan and, if a loan has already been made 
shall constitute a loan default for which the remaining balance of the 
loan shall become immediately due and payable.
    (f) For sugar-related loans, in addition to the requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section, sugar processors shall also insure the 
contents of storage structures used as collateral for a sugar-related 
facility loan against all perils.

<R05>
Sec. 1436.16  Foreclosure, liquidation, assumptions, sale or conveyance, 
bankruptcy.

    (a) The collateral or land securing a loan may be sold by CCC 
whenever CCC has declared the entire indebtedness immediately due and 
payable under this part as follows:
    (1) If a demand for payment is not received by the due date 
acceptable to CCC, CCC may call the loan and initiate foreclosure 
proceedings by issuing a liquidation letter to the borrower.
    (2) The debtor may voluntarily agree to allow removal of the 
collateral to facilitate sale by signing an agreement for sale. If the 
debtor objects to removal of collateral, the law of the state where the 
collateral exists will be used to foreclose on the property.
    (3) For loans with movable collateral and no real estate lien, CCC 
may sell the collateral for the best price obtainable. Sales proceeds 
shall be distributed in the following order:
    (i) To CCC to satisfy the debtor's indebtedness including all costs 
associated with selling the collateral.

[[Page 544]]

    (ii) Payment to junior lien holders if approved by USDA's Office of 
the General Counsel and then to the borrower or other persons as 
determined appropriate by that office.
    (4) For loans with nonmovable collateral, as determined by CCC, and 
no real estate lien, CCC may establish a claim according to 7 CFR part 
1403.
    (5) For loans secured with a real estate lien, CCC may obtain an 
appraisal of the property. Sales proceeds shall be distributed in the 
following order:
    (i) To CCC to satisfy the debtor's indebtedness including all costs 
associated with selling the collateral and the appraisal.
    (ii) To junior lien holders if approved by USDA's Office of the 
General Counsel; or
    (iii) To the borrower or other persons as determined appropriate by 
that office.
    (b) Assumption by another borrower of a farm storage facility loan 
is permitted subject to county committee approval and the subsequent 
borrower's ability to show a satisfactory credit history. An assumption 
of the loan may be approved when the collateral is sold by CCC to an 
otherwise eligible borrower, the current borrower will convey the 
collateral or property securing the loan to another eligible borrower, 
or the borrower is dead, incompetent, or missing and an eligible 
borrower wants to assume the loan.
    (1) Requests for approval of assumptions shall be made to the county 
committee by the borrower, the borrower's successors, or representatives 
of the borrower. If approval is granted, the borrower's successors or 
representatives shall execute a new farm storage facility note and 
security agreement for the balance of the term of the loan.
    (2) The principal amount of the loan shall include the unpaid amount 
of the loan, interest computed to the date of assumption, all past due 
installments, and any other charges that may be required.
    (c) The borrower may voluntarily convey the collateral to CCC before 
repaying the loan. Before a borrower sells or conveys the facilities or 
other property securing a loan without repaying the loan in full, the 
borrower shall obtain approval for the sale or conveyance from the FSA 
county committee with the understanding that sale proceeds shall be paid 
to satisfy the borrowers indebtedness to CCC.
    (d) Remedies provided for in this section shall, unless CCC 
determines otherwise, be subject to the administrative appeals provided 
for elsewhere in this part, including those that are found at Sec. 
1436.13.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.17  Environmental compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise specified in this section, prior to approval 
of any farm storage facility loan, an environmental evaluation will be 
completed to determine if the proposed action will have any adverse 
impacts on the environment and cultural resources.
    (b) If it is determined that a proposed action or group of proposed 
actions will not result in any adverse impact, the action will be 
considered as being categorically excluded for the purpose of compliance 
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 40 CFR parts 1500-
1508.
    (c)(1) If adverse environmental impacts (either direct or indirect) 
are identified, an environmental assessment will be completed in 
accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's Regulations for 
Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA.
    (2) The environmental assessment will be used to develop an action 
that results in no significant environmental impact on the human 
environment or cultural resources.
    (3) No action will be approved that has been determined to have 
significant impacts on the human environment or cultural resources.
    (d)(1) In order to minimize the exposure to environmental 
liabilities from the presence of contamination on real estate 
collateral, an evaluation will be made of the economic and environmental 
risks to the real estate collateral posed by the presence of hazardous 
substances and petroleum products.
    (2) If the evaluation made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
reveals that the collateral is or may be contaminated, then the 
applicant will be notified and given an option of offering as collateral 
other real estate that is

[[Page 545]]

free from contamination or remediating the contamination on the original 
site offered as collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.18  Appeals.

    The appeal, reconsideration, or review of all determinations made 
under this part, except for provisions for which there are no appeal 
rights because they are determined rules of general applicability, must 
be in accordance with parts 11 and 780 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 1436.19  Equal Opportunity and Non-discrimination requirements.

    (a) No recipient of a Storage Facility loan shall directly, or 
through contractual or other arrangement, subject any person or cause 
any person to be subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, 
religion, color, national origin, gender, or other prohibited basis. 
Borrowers must comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations 
regarding equal opportunity in hiring, procurement, and related matters.
    (b) With respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, CCC will not 
discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, color, 
religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age, provided the 
applicant can execute a legal contract. Nor will CCC discriminate on the 
basis of whether all or a part of the applicant's income derives from 
any public assistance program, or whether the applicant in good faith, 
exercises any rights under the Consumer Protection Act.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1437.1  Applicability.

    (a) The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) is 
intended to provide eligible producers of eligible crops coverage 
equivalent to the catastrophic risk protection level of crop

[[Page 546]]

insurance. NAP is designed to help reduce production risks faced by 
producers of commercial crops or other agricultural commodities. NAP 
will reduce financial losses that occur when natural disasters cause a 
catastrophic loss of production or where producers are prevented from 
planting an eligible crop.
    (b) The provisions contained in this part are applicable to eligible 
producers and eligible crops for which catastrophic coverage under 
section 508(b) the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(b)), as 
amended, or its successors, is not available.
    (c) The regulations of this part are applicable to the 2001 and 
subsequent crop years.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.2  Administration.

    (a) NAP is administered under the general supervision of the 
Executive Vice-President, CCC (who also serves as Administrator, Farm 
Service Agency), and shall be carried out by State and county FSA 
committees (State and county committees).
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and their 
employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any of the 
provisions of the regulations of this part.
    (c) The State committee shall take any action required by the 
regulations of this part that the county committee has not taken. The 
State committee shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the 
regulations of this part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice-President, CCC, or a designee, from 
determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or 
modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines (except statutory deadlines) in 
cases where lateness to file does not adversely affect operation of the 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.3  Definitions.

    The definitions and program parameters set out in this section shall 
be applicable for all purposes of administering the Noninsured Crop 
Disaster Assistance Program provided for in this part. Although the 
terms defined in part 718 of this title and part 1400 of this chapter 
shall also be applicable, the definitions set forth in this section 
shall govern for all purposes of administering the Program.
    Actual Production History (APH) means the farm's operative 
production history established in accordance with subpart B of this 
part.
    Administrative county office means the county FSA office designated 
to make determinations, handle official records, and issue payments for 
the producer in accordance with 7 CFR part 718.
    Animal Unit Days (AUD) means an expression of expected or actual 
stocking rate for pasture or forage.
    Application Closing Date means the last date, as determined by CCC, 
producers can submit an application for coverage for noninsured crops 
for the specified crop year.
    Catastrophic coverage means a catastrophic risk protection (CAT) 
level of crop insurance available in accordance with section 508(b) of 
the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended.
    Catastrophic loss means--
    (1) Loss, as the result of an eligible cause of loss, that entails 
as determined by CCC:
    (i) Prevented planting of greater than 35 percent of the intended 
crop acreage; a yield loss of greater than 50 percent of the approved 
yield; or value loss of greater than 50 percent of the pre-disaster 
value; or
    (ii) AUD loss of greater than 50 percent of the expected AUD.
    (2)The quantity will not be reduced for any quality consideration 
unless a zero value is established.
    Controlled environment means, with respect to those crops for which 
a controlled environment is expected to be provided, including but not 
limited to

[[Page 547]]

ornamental nursery, aquaculture (including ornamental fish), and 
floriculture, an environment in which everything that can practicably be 
controlled with structures, facilities, growing media (including but not 
limited to water, soil, or nutrients) by the producer, is in fact 
controlled by the producer.
    Crop year means the calendar year in which the crop is normally 
harvested or in which the majority of the crop would have been 
harvested. For value loss and other specific commodities, see the 
applicable subpart and section of this part. For crops for which 
catastrophic coverage is available, the crop year will be as defined by 
such coverage.
    Fiber means a slender and greatly elongated natural plant filament, 
e.g. cotton, flax, etc. used in manufacturing, as determined by CCC.
    Final planting date means the date which marks the end of the 
planting period for the crop and in particular the last day, as 
determined by CCC, the crop can be planted to reasonably expect to 
achieve 100 percent of the expected yield in the intended harvest year 
or planting period.
    Food means a material consisting essentially of protein, 
carbohydrates, and fat used in the body to sustain growth, repair, and 
vital processes including the crops used for the preparation of food, as 
determined by CCC.
    Good farming practices means the cultural practices generally used 
for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and produce at 
least the individual unit approved yield. These practices are normally 
those recognized by Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension 
Service as compatible with agronomic and weather conditions.
    Harvested means the producer has removed the crop from the field by 
hand, mechanically, or by grazing of livestock. The crop is considered 
harvested once it is removed from the field and placed in a truck or 
other conveyance or is consumed through the act of grazing. Crops 
normally placed in a truck or other conveyance and taken off the crop 
acreage, such as hay are considered harvested when in the bale, whether 
removed from the field or not.

other crops specifically designated by CCC.
    Intended Use means for a crop or a commodity, the end use for which 
it is grown and produced.
    Multiple planted means the same crop is planted and harvested during 
two or more distinct planting periods in the same crop year, as 
determined by CCC.
    Normal harvest date means the date harvest of the crop is normally 
completed in the administrative county, as determined by CCC.
    Seed crop means propagation stock commercially produced for sale as 
seed stock for eligible crops.
    Seeded forage means forage on acreage mechanically seeded with 
forage vegetation at regular intervals, at least every 7 years, in 
accordance with good farming practices.
    T-Yield means the yield which is based on the county expected yield 
of the crop for the crop year and is used on an adjusted or unadjusted 
basis to calculate the approved yield for crops covered under the NAP 
when less than four years of actual, assigned, or appraised yields are 
available in the APH data base.
    Transitional yield means an estimated yield of that name provided in 
the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) actuarial table which is 
used to calculate an average/approved APH yield for crops insured under 
the Federal Crop Insurance Act when less than four years of actual, 
temporary, and/or assigned yields are available on a crop by county 
basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.4  Eligibility.

<R05>
Sec. 1437.5  Coverage period.

    (a) The coverage period is the time during which coverage is 
available against loss of production of the eligible crop as a result of 
natural disaster.
    (b) The coverage period for annual crops, including annual forage 
crops, begins the later of 30 calendar days after the date the 
application for coverage is filed; or the date the crop is planted, not 
to exceed the final planting date; and ends on the earlier of the date 
harvest is complete; the normal harvest date of the crop in the area; 
the date the crop is abandoned; or the date the crop is destroyed.
    (c) Except as otherwise specified in this part, the coverage period 
for biennial and perennial crops begins 30 calendar days after the

is complete; or the normal harvest date.
    (g) For biennial and perennial forage crops the coverage period 
begins the later of 30 calendar days after the application closing date; 
for first year seedings, the date the crop was planted; or the date 
following the normal harvest date. The coverage ends on the normal 
harvest date of the subsequent year.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.6  Application for coverage and service fee.

    (a) With respect to each crop, commodity or acreage, producers must 
file an application for coverage under this part no later than the 
application closing date.
    (b) The service fee must be paid at the time of the application. The 
service fee is $100 per crop per administrative county, up to $300 per 
producer per administrative county, but not to exceed $900 per producer.
    (c) The service fee will be applied per administrative county by 
crop definition and planting period, as determined by CCC.
    (d) Limited resource farmers may request that the service fee be 
waived and must request such a waiver prior to, or at the same time the 
application for coverage is filed. For this purpose, a ``limited 
resource farmer'' shall be given the meaning assigned by 7 CFR 457.8.

[[Page 549]]

    (e) For 2001 and 2002 crops for which the application closing date 
would normally have been established prior to March 19, 2002, or 
established within 60 calendar days after March 19, 2002, producers must 
within 30 calendar days after March 19, 2002:
    (1) Submit a 2001 or 2002 crop application for coverage, as 
applicable, and pay the applicable service fee; and
    (2) Certify the 2000 and 2001 crop year production for the crop, if 
applicable.
    (f) For 2001 and 2002 crops which have suffered damage or loss, 
producers must, in addition to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, have 
complied with all requirements of this part prior to its revision on 
March 19, 2002, (and contained in the 7 CFR, parts 1200 to 1599, edition 
revised as of January 1, 2002) including having filed a timely:
    (1) Report of acreage;
    (2) Notice of loss; and
    (3) Application for payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.7  Records.

    (a) Producers must maintain records of crop acreage, acreage yields, 
and production for the crop for which an application for coverage is 
filed in accordance with Sec. 1437.5. For those crops or commodities 
for which it is impractical, as determined by CCC, to maintain crop 
acreage, yields or production, producers must maintain records, in 
addition to the available records required by this section, as may be 
required in subparts C, D and E, of this part. Producers must retain 
records of the production and acreage yield for a minimum of 3 years for 
each crop for which an application for coverage is filed in accordance 
with Sec. 1437.6. Producers may be selected on a random or targeted 
basis and be required to provide records acceptable to CCC to support 
the certification provided. For each crop for which producers file an 
application for payment in accordance with Sec. 1437.10 that is 
harvested, producers must provide documentary evidence of production, 
acceptable to CCC, and the date harvest was completed. Such documentary 
evidence must be filed not later than the application closing date for 
the crop in the subsequent crop year. Records of a previous crop year's 
production for inclusion in the actual production history database used 
to calculate an approved yield for the current crop year must be 
certified by the producer no later than the application closing date for 
the crop in the current crop year. Production data provided after the 
application closing date in the current crop year for the crop may be 
included in the actual production history data base for the calculation 
of subsequent approved yield calculations if accompanied by acceptable 
records of production as determined by CCC. Records of production 
acceptable to CCC may include:
    (1) Commercial receipts, settlement sheets, warehouse ledger sheets, 
or load summaries if the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of 
through commercial channels provided the records are reliable or 
verifiable as determined by CCC; and
    (2) Such documentary evidence such as contemporaneous measurements, 
truck scale tickets, and contemporaneous diaries, as is necessary in 
order to verify the information provided if the eligible crop has been 
fed to livestock, or otherwise disposed of other than through commercial 
channels, provided the records are reliable or verifiable as determined 
by CCC. If the crop will be disposed of through retail sales, such as: 
roadside stands, u-pick, etc. and the producer will not be able to 
certify acceptable records of production, the producer must request an 
appraisal of the unit acreage prior to harvest of the crop acreage.
    (b) Producers must provide verifiable evidence, as determined by 
CCC, of:
    (1) An interest in the commodity produced or control of the crop 
acreage on which the commodity was grown at the time of disaster; and
    (2) The authority of the applicable individual to execute program 
documents.
    (c) Reports of acreage planted or intended but prevented from being 
planted must be provided to CCC at the administrative FSA office for the 
acreage no later than the date specified by CCC for each crop and 
location. Reports of acreage filed beyond the date specified by CCC for 
the crop and location may, however, be considered timely filed if all 
the provisions of 7 CFR 718.103 are met. In the case of a crop-share 
arrangement, all producers will be bound

[[Page 550]]

by the acreage report filed by the landowner or operator unless the 
producer files a separate acreage report prior to the date specified by 
CCC for the crop and location. Reports of acreage planted or intended 
and prevented from being planted must include all of the following 
information:
    (1) Number of acres of the eligible crop in the administrative 
county (for each planting in the event of multiple planting) in which 
the producer has a share;
    (2) Zero acres planted when the producer's crop for which an 
application for coverage was filed, is not planted;
    (3) The producer's share of the eligible crop at the time an 
application for coverage was filed;
    (4) The FSA farm serial number;
    (5) The identity of the crop, practices, intended uses, and for 
forage crops, the predominant species or type and variety of the 
vegetation;
    (6) The identity of all producers sharing in the crop;
    (7) The date the crop was planted or planting was completed, 
including the age of the perennial crops; and
    (8) The acreage intended but prevented from being planted.
    (d) Producers receiving a guaranteed payment for planted acreage, as 
opposed to receiving a payment only upon delivery of the production must 
provide documentation of any written or verbal contract or arrangement 
with the buyer to CCC. Net production, as determined by CCC, may be 
adjusted upward by the amount of production corresponding to the amount 
of the contract payment received.
    (e) Producers must provide documentation of any salvage value 
received by or made available for the quantity of the crop or commodity 
that cannot be marketed or sold in any market, as determined by CCC and 
any value received by or made available for a secondary use of the crop 
or commodity.
    (f) Producers requesting payment under this part must maintain 
records which substantiate gross revenue for the tax year preceding the 
crop year for which coverage is requested.
    (g) Producers requesting a waiver of service fees as a limited 
resource producer must maintain records which substantiate annual gross 
income for the two tax years preceding the crop year for which coverage 
is requested.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.8  Unit division.

    Except as determined by CCC, a unit shall be all acreage of the 
eligible crop in the administrative county operated by the same 
producer(s). In cases where the owners of land are also producers, units 
shall be further divided based on ownership interest of the land.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.9  Causes of loss.

    (a) To be eligible for benefits under this part, crops must be 
damaged or prevented from being planted by drought, flood or other 
natural disasters and conditions related thereto. Not all named perils 
are eligible causes of loss for all crops. Eligible causes of loss 
include:
    (1) Damaging weather occurring prior to or during harvest, including 
but not limited to drought, hail, excessive moisture, freeze, tornado, 
hurricane, excessive wind, or any combination thereof;
    (2) Adverse natural occurrence occurring prior to or during harvest, 
such as earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption; and
    (3) A related condition, including but not limited to heat, insect 
infestation, or disease, which occurs as a result of an adverse natural 
occurrence or damaging weather occurring prior to or during harvest, 
that directly causes, accelerates, or exacerbates the destruction or 
deterioration of an eligible crop, as determined by the Secretary.
    (b) Ineligible causes of loss include but are not limited to:
    (1) Factors or circumstances that are not the result of an eligible 
cause of loss affecting specific crop or commodity;
    (2) The negligence or malfeasance of the producer;
    (3) The failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop in those 
areas and under such circumstances where it is customary to reseed;
    (4) Failure of the producer to follow good farming practices, as 
determined by CCC;
    (5) Water contained or released by any governmental, public, or 
private

[[Page 551]]

dam or reservoir project, if an easement exists on the acreage affected 
for the containment or release of the water;
    (6) Failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities; or
    (7) Except for tree crops and perennials, inadequate irrigation 
resources at the beginning of the crop year;
    (8) A loss of inventory (or yield as applicable) of aquiculture 
(including ornamental fish), floriculture or ornamental nursery stemming 
from drought or any failure to provide water, soil, or growing media to 
such crop for any reason;
    (9) Any failure to provide a controlled environment or exercise good 
nursery practices where such controlled environment or practices are a 
condition of eligibility under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.10  Notice of loss and application for payment.

    (a) At least one producer having a share in the unit must provide a 
notice of loss to CCC in the administrative FSA office for the unit, 
within:
    (1) For prevented planting claims, 15 calendar days after the final 
planting date,
    (2) For low yield claims and allowable value loss, the earlier of:
    (i) 15 calendar days after the damaging weather or adverse natural 
occurrence, or date loss of the crop or commodity becomes apparent for 
low yield claims; and
    (ii) 15 calendar days after the normal harvest date.
    (b) For each crop for which a notice of loss is filed, producers 
must provide the following information:
    (1) Crop by type or variety, as applicable;
    (2) The cause of the crop damage;
    (3) Date the loss occurred, as applicable;
    (4) Date the damage or loss became apparent;
    (5) The existence of a guaranteed payment through a contract or 
agreement for planted acreage as opposed to delivery of production, if 
one exists;
    (6) Type of crop loss occurred, e.g. prevented planting or low 
yield;
    (7) Practices employed to grow the crop, e.g. irrigated or non-
irrigated;
    (8) For prevented planting:
    (i) Total acreage intended to be planted to the crop in the 
administrative county;
    (ii) Total acreage planted by the producer to the crop in the 
administrative county;
    (iii) Whether a purchase, delivery, or arrangement for purchase or 
delivery was made for seed, chemicals, fertilizer, etc; and
    (iv) What and when land preparation measures, e.g. cultivation, etc. 
were completed and indicate what has been done or will be done with the 
acreage, e.g. abandoned, replanted, etc.
    (9) For low yield:
    (i) Total acreage planted by the producer to the crop in the 
administrative county;
    (ii) Total acreage of the crop in the administrative county 
affected;
    (iii) What and when land preparation measures and practices, e.g. 
cultivation, planting, irrigated, etc. were completed before and after 
the loss; and
    (iv) What will be done with the affected crop acreage, e.g. 
harvested, destroyed and replanted to a different crop, abandoned, etc.
    (10) Any such other information requested by CCC to establish the 
loss.
    (c) A notice of loss provided beyond the time specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section may be considered timely filed if, at the discretion 
of CCC, provided at such time to permit an authorized CCC representative 
the opportunity to:
    (1) Verify the information on the notice of loss by inspection of 
the specific acreage or crop involved; and
    (2) Determine, based on information obtained by inspection of the 
specific acreage or crop involved, that an eligible cause of loss, as 
opposed to other circumstance, caused the claimed damage or loss.
    (d) Crop acreage that will not be harvested, i.e. acreage that is to 
be abandoned or destroyed or in the case of forage acreage intended to 
be mechanically harvested but grazed, must be left intact and producers 
must request, in the administrative FSA office for the acreage, a crop 
appraisal and release of crop acreage by a FCIC- or CCC-approved loss 
adjustor:

[[Page 552]]

    (1) Prior to destruction or abandonment of the crop acreage; or
    (2) No later than the normal harvest date, as determined by CCC.
    (e) Producers must apply for payments prior to the earlier of the:
    (1) Date an application for coverage is filed for the crop for the 
subsequent crop year; or
    (2) Application closing date for the crop for the subsequent crop 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.11  Average market price and payment factors.

    (a) An average market price will be used to calculate assistance 
under this part and will be:
    (1) A dollar value per the applicable unit of measure of the 
eligible crop;
    (2) Determined on a harvested basis without the inclusion of 
transportation, storage, processing, marketing, or other post-harvest 
expenses, as determined by CCC;
    (3) Comparable with established FCIC prices; and
    (4) Determined, as practicable, for each intended use of a crop 
within a State for a crop year.
    (b) For these purposes, where needed, an Animal-unit-days (AUD) 
value will be based on the national average price of corn and the daily 
requirement of 13.6 megacalories of net energy for maintenance of 1 
animal unit.
    (c) Payment factors will be used to calculate assistance for crops 
produced with significant and variable harvesting expenses that are not 
incurred because the crop acreage was prevented planted or planted but 
not harvested, as determined by CCC.
    (d) An adjusted market price will be calculated based on the 
provisions in this section and others as may apply. A final payment 
price will be determined by multiplying, as appropriate, the average 
market price by the applicable payment factor (i.e. harvested, 
unharvested, or prevented planting) by 55 percent or, by multiplying the 
applicable AUD (as adjusted, if adjusted) by 55 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.12  Crop definition.

    (a) For the purpose of providing benefits under this part, CCC will, 
at its discretion, define crops as specified in this section.
    (b) CCC may separate or combine types and varieties as a crop when 
specific credible information as determined by CCC is provided showing 
the crop of a specific type or variety has a significantly different or 
similar value when compared to other types or varieties, as determined 
by CCC.
    (c) CCC may recognize two or more different crops planted on the 
same acreage intended for harvest during the same crop year as two or 
more separate crops. The crop acreage may include a crop intended for 
harvest before planting of a succeeding crop or a succeeding crop 
interseeded with the preceding crop prior to intended harvest of the 
preceding crop. The acreage must be in an area where the practice is 
recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by CCC, and all 
crops are recognized by CCC as able to achieve the expected yield, as 
determined by CCC.
    (d) CCC may consider crop acreage that is harvested more than once 
during the same crop year from the same plant as a single crop. The 
acreage must be in an area where the practice is recognized as a good 
farming practice, as determined by CCC.
    (e) CCC may consider each planting period of multiple planted 
acreage as a separate crop. The acreage must be in an area where the 
practice is recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by CCC.
    (f) CCC may define forage as separate crops according to the 
intended method of harvest, either mechanical harvest or grazed.
    (g) Forage acreage intended to be grazed may be further defined as 
warm and cool season forage crops.
    (h) Forage acreage intended to be mechanically harvested may be 
defined as a separate crop from grazed forage and may be separated based 
upon the commodity used as forage, to the extent such separation is 
allowed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (i) Crop acreage intended for the production of seed may be 
considered a separate crop from other intended uses, as determined by 
CCC, if all the following criteria apply:
    (1) The specific crop acreage is seeded, or intended to be seeded, 
with an

[[Page 553]]

intent of producing commercial seed as its primary intended use;
    (2) There is no possibility of other commercial uses of production 
from the same crop without regard to market conditions; and
    (3) The growing period of the specific crop acreage is uniquely 
conducive to the production of commercial seed and not conducive to the 
production of any other intended use of the crop, (e.g. vernalization in 
a biennial crop such as carrots and onions) and that accommodation 
renders the possibility of production for any other intended use of the 
crop improbable.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.13  Multiple benefits.

    (a) If a producer is eligible to receive payments under this part 
and benefits under any other program administered by the Secretary for 
the same crop loss, the producer must choose whether to receive the 
other program benefits or payments under this part, but shall not be 
eligible for both. The limitation on multiple benefits prohibits a 
producer from being compensated more than once for the same loss.
    (b) The limitation on multiple benefits in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply in any respect to Emergency Loans under subtitle 
C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961 et 
seq).
    (c) The restriction on multiple benefits does not relieve the 
producer from the requirements of making a production and acreage 
report.
    (d) If the other USDA program benefits are not available until after 
an application for benefits has been filed under this part, the producer 
may, to avoid this restriction on such other benefits, refund the total 
amount of the payment to the administrative FSA office from which the 
payment was received.

Sec. 1437.14  Payment and income limitations.

    (a) NAP payments shall not be made in excess of $100,000 per person 
per crop year under this part.
    (b) NAP payments shall not be made to a person who has qualifying 
gross revenues in excess of $2 million for the most recent tax year 
preceding the year for which assistance is requested. Qualifying gross 
revenue means:
    (1) With respect to a person who receives more than 50 percent of 
such person's gross income from farming, ranching, and forestry 
operations, the annual gross income for the taxable year from such 
operations; and
    (2) With respect to a person who receives 50 percent or less of such 
person's gross income from farming, ranching, and forestry operations, 
the person's total gross income for the taxable year from all sources.
    (c) CCC will pay, for up to one year, simple interest on payments to 
producers which are delayed. Interest will be paid on the net amount 
ultimately found to be due, and will begin accruing on the 31st day 
after the date the producer signs, dates, and submits a properly 
completed application for payment on the designated form, or the 31st 
day after a disputed application is adjudicated. Interest will be paid 
unless the reason for failure to timely pay is due to the producer's 
failure to provide information or other material necessary for the 
computation of payment, or there was a genuine dispute concerning 
eligibility for payment.
    (d) Rules set out in 7 CFR part 1400 shall apply in implementing the 
restrictions of this section.

<R04>
  Subpart B_Determining Yield Coverage Using Actual Production History


<R05>
Sec. 1437.101  Actual production history.

    Actual production history will be used, except as otherwise 
indicated in this part, as the basis for providing noninsured crop 
disaster assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.102  Yield determinations.

    (a) Payments based on yields shall be made on ``approved yields'', 
which shall be calculated based on the producer's APH for that period up 
to ten years for which, of the first time such a yield is calculated, 
there are consecutive years, beginning with the most recent completed 
year, of actual production history for the producer. If there are not 
four such consecutive years of history (excluding years when the crop 
was out of rotation), then such first ``approved yield'' shall be 
constructed by creating a four year history as provided for in this 
part. After the first such approved yield is constructed, years will be 
added to that history in the manner provided for in this section, 
dropping, as needed, previous years from the history to the extent that 
the current history would be a history or base of ten years. For the 
first approved yield, as needed to construct a four-year history, 
history will be supplied using T-yields, as set out in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) The county expected yield:
    (1) Is the ``T-yield'' for the crop, and is the Olympic average 
(disregarding the high and low yields) of yields in the county the 5 
consecutive crop years immediately preceding the previous crop year. 
(Example: For the 2001 crop year, the base period would be 1995 through 
1999).
    (2) Will be the same as the FCIC transitional yield if crop 
insurance is available for the crop, (but not necessarily for the cause 
of loss if excluded by policy provisions), in the administrative county.
    (3) Will be calculated so as to be comparable to the FCIC 
transitional yield most reasonable to the area if crop insurance was 
available for the crop (but not necessarily for the cause of loss) in 
contiguous counties, but not in the immediate county.

[[Page 555]]

    (c) Available historical information will be used to establish the 
county expected yields. Historical information is available from sources 
including, but is not limited to, National Agricultural Statistics 
Service data, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension 
Service records, Federal Crop Insurance Data, credible non-government 
studies, yields in similar areas, and reported actual yield data. Such 
yields will be based on the acreage intended for harvest.
    (d) County expected yields may be adjusted for:
    (1) Yield variations due to different farming practices in the 
administrative county such as: irrigated, nonirrigated, and organic 
practices; and
    (2) Cultural practices, including the age of the planting when such 
practices are different from those used on acreage to establish the 
yield.
    (e) A T-yield will be used in the actual production history database 
when less than four consecutive crop years of actual, assigned, or zero 
yields, as applicable, are available. For those producers who have land 
physically located in multiple counties and administered out of one 
county office, the T-yield for all land for the producer will be based 
on the administrative county's expected yield for that crop. Where a 
four-year base must be constructed for the producer's first approved 
yield because the producer does not have at least four consecutive years 
of actual history starting with the most recent year, then:
    (1) If an approved yield had not previously been calculated for the 
crop and there are no production records available for the most recent 
crop year, or if there is no formula provided for the producer under 
paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section, then the approved yield 
for the current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of 65 
percent of the applicable T-yield for each of the four years of the 
constructed base;
    (2) If certified acceptable production records are available for 
only the most recent crop year and there are no zero (credited) or 
assigned yields in the producer's history, the approved yield for the 
current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of the one 
actual yield plus 80 percent of the applicable T-Yield for the missing 
crop years.
    (3) If certified acceptable production records are available for 
only the two most recent crop years and there are no zero (credited) or 
assigned yields in the APH database, the approved yield for the current 
crop year will be calculated on the simple average of the two actual 
yields plus 90 percent of the applicable T-yield for the missing years.
    (4) If certified acceptable production records are available for 
only the three most recent crop years and there are no zero (credited) 
or assigned yields in the APH database, the approved yield will be 
calculated on the simple average of the three actual yields plus 100 
percent of the applicable T-Yield for the missing year.
    (f) CCC will reduce unadjusted T-yields placed in the actual 
production history database when, as determined by CCC, an unadjusted T-
yield does not accurately reflect the productive capability of specific 
crop acreage.
    (g) An actual yield includes the total amount of harvested and 
appraised production on a per acre, or other basis, as applicable.
    (h) Once an approved yield has been calculated for any year, then 
thereafter an assigned yield will be used to update or extend the 
producer's actual production history (or base) database when producers 
fail to certify a report of production after the approved yield was 
calculated and the following standards shall apply:
    (1) The assigned one-year yield will be equal to 75 percent of the 
approved yield calculated for the most recent crop year for which 
producers do not certify a report of production.
    (2) Producers may have only one assigned yield in the actual 
production history database.
    (3) Producers may replace an assigned yield with an actual yield by 
providing a certification of production and production records for the 
applicable crop year in accordance with Sec. 1437.7.
    (4) If the acreage of a crop in the administrative county in which 
the unit is located for the crop year increases by more than 100 percent 
over any year in the preceding seven crop years, or

[[Page 556]]

significantly from the previous crop years, as determined by CCC, 
producers may not receive an assigned yield and will receive a zero 
credited yield, unless producers provide:
    (i) Detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and 
yield for the crop year for which the producer is requesting assistance, 
or
    (ii) If CCC determines those records are inadequate, proof that the 
eligible crop, had it been harvested, could have been marketed at a 
reasonable price.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(4) of this section an assigned 
yield may be used if:
    (i) The planted acreage for the crop has been inspected by a third 
party acceptable to CCC, or
    (ii) The FSA county executive director, with the concurrence of the 
FSA state executive director, makes a recommendation for an exemption 
from the requirements and such recommendation is approved by CCC.
    (6) A zero credited yield will be used to the extent provided for in 
paragraph (i) of this section.
    (i) A zero credited yield will be placed in the actual production 
history database for each crop year, following the crop year containing 
an assigned yield, for which producers do not certify a report of 
production. A zero credited yield may be replaced with an actual yield 
by providing a certification of production and production records for 
the applicable crop year in accordance with Sec. 1437.7.
    (j) An approved yield is calculated as the simple average of a 
minimum of four, not to exceed a maximum of 10 consecutive crop year 
yields for the crops, or as determined by CCC and as provided in this 
section.
    (1) If, for one or more actual production history crop years used to 
establish the approved yield, the actual or appraised yield is less than 
65 percent of the current crop year T-yield due to losses incurred in a 
disaster year, as determined by CCC, producers may request CCC replace 
the applicable yield with a yield equal to 65 percent of the current 
crop year T-yield.
    (2) If approved yields were calculated for any of the 1995 through 
2000 crop years, and subsequently in that period production was not 
certified, producers may request CCC replace the missing yields for such 
years with yields equal to the higher of 65 percent of the current crop 
year T-yield or the missing crop years actual yield.
    (3) If producers add land in the farming operation and do not have 
available production records for the added land CCC will calculate an 
approved yield for the new unit by utilizing the actual production 
history yields for the existing unit. In the event the crop suffers a 
loss greater than 50 percent of the initial approved yield for the crop 
year and unit acreage has increased by more than 75 percent of the 
historical average acreage, CCC may adjust the approved yield, as 
determined by CCC.
    (k) If a producer is a new producer, the approved yield may be based 
on unadjusted T-Yields or a combination of actual yields and unadjusted 
T-Yields. A new producer is a person who has not been actively engaged 
in farming for a share of the production of the eligible crop in the 
administrative county for more than two APH crop years. Formation or 
dissolution of an entity which includes individuals with more than two 
APH crop years of production history during the base period does not 
qualify the new entity as a new producer for APH determination purposes.
    (l) If producers qualify as a new producer and have produced the 
crop for 1 or 2 crop years, producers must provide to CCC at the 
administrative FSA office serving the area in which the crop is located, 
a certification and records of production for those crop years.
    (m) Further adjustments may be made as necessary to accomplish the 
purposes of this program.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.103  Determining payments for low yield.

    (a) Except to the extent that the loss calculation provisions of 
other subparts apply, and subject to limitations set out elsewhere in 
this part and in this title and to the availability of funds, payments 
under this part shall be made on eligible crops with eligible losses by:
    (1) Multiplying the total eligible acreage planted to the eligible 
crop by

[[Page 557]]

the producers share, and subject to provisions for specific crops 
provided elsewhere in this part;
    (2) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 
50 percent of the approved yield per acre for the commodity for the 
producer.
    (3) Subtracting net production of the total eligible acreage from 
the product of paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (4) Multiplying the difference calculated under paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section by the final payment price calculated under Sec. 1437.11, 
and then
    (5) Subtracting the value of salvage and secondary use.
    (b) Further adjustments may be made as needed to accomplish the 
purposes and goals of the program.

    (a) Honey production eligible for benefits under this part includes 
table and non-table honey produced commercially.
    (b) All of a producer's honey will be considered a single crop, 
regardless of type or variety of floral source or intended use.
    (c) The crop year for honey production is the calendar year, January 
1 through December 31.
    (d) In addition to filing a report of acreage in accordance with 
Sec. 1437.7, honey producers must provide a record of colonies to CCC. 
The report of colonies must be filed before the crop year for which 
producers seek to maintain coverage. The report of colonies shall 
include:
    (1) The address of the producer's headquarters and FSA farm serial 
number, if available;
    (2) Names and shares of each person sharing in the honey produced 
from the unit;
    (3) The number of all colonies of bees belonging to the unit;
    (4) The names of counties in which colonies of bees are located as 
of the date of the report; and
    (5) A certification of the number of colonies reported including all 
colonies from which production is expected.
    (e) The honey unit shall consist of all the producer's bee colonies, 
regardless of location.
    (f) Producers must designate a FSA office as the control office for 
the honey operation. Producers must complete the following actions only 
in the control office:
    (1) File an application for coverage;
    (2) File a report of colonies;
    (3) Report total unit production; and
    (4) Request to change a unit's control office.
    (g) Actions that may be taken in any Administrative FSA office 
includes:
    (1) Designating or selecting another control office; or
    (2) Filing a notice of loss in accordance with Sec. 1437.10.
    (h) Producers must notify the control office designated in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section within 30 calendar days of 
the date of:
    (1) Any changes in the total number of colonies; and
    (2) The movement of any colonies into any additional counties.
    (i) Payments will be based on the amount of losses for this 
community in excess of a 50 percent loss level at a rate determined in 
accord with this part and the authorizing legislation.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.105  Maple sap.

    (a) NAP assistance for maple sap is limited to maple sap produced on 
private property for sale as sap or syrup. Eligible maple sap must be 
produced from trees that:
    (1) Are located on land the producer controls by ownership or lease;
    (2) Are managed for production of maple sap;
    (3) Are at least 30 years old and 12 inches in diameter; and
    (4) Have a maximum of 4 taps per tree according to the tree's 
diameter.
    (b) The crop year for maple sap production is the calendar year, 
January 1 through December 31.
    (c) If producers file an application for coverage in accordance with 
Sec. 1437.6, tree acreage containing trees from which maple sap is 
produced or is to be produced must be reported to CCC no later than the 
beginning of the crop year.
    (d) In addition to the applicable records required under Sec. 
1437.7, producers must report the:
    (1) Total number of eligible trees on the unit;
    (2) Average size and age of producing trees; and

[[Page 558]]

    (3) Total number of taps placed or anticipated for the tapping 
season.
    (e) A maximum county-expected-yield for maple sap shall be 10 
gallons of sap per tap per crop year unless acceptable documentary 
evidence, as determined by CCC, is available to CCC to support a higher 
county-expected-yield.
    (f) The average market price for maple sap must be established for 
the value of the sap before processing into syrup. If price data is 
available only for maple syrup, this data must be converted to a maple 
sap basis. The wholesale price for a gallon of maple syrup shall be 
multiplied by 0.00936 to arrive at the average market price of a gallon 
of maple sap.
    (g) The actual production history for maple sap shall be recorded on 
the basis of gallons of sap per tap.
    (h) The unit's expected production is determined by:
    (1) Multiplying the number of taps placed in eligible trees; by
    (2) The approved per tap yield as determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1437.102.

      Subpart C_Determining Coverage for Prevented Planted Acreage


<R05>
Sec. 1437.201  Prevented planting acreage.

    (a) Prevented planting is the inability to plant an eligible crop 
with proper equipment during the planting period as a result of an 
eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC.
    (b) The eligible cause of loss that prevented planting must have:
    (1) Occurred after a previous planting period for the crop and
    (2) Before the final planting date for the crop in the applicable 
crop year or in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the 
first planting in the applicable planting period, and
    (3) Generally affected other producers in the area, as determined by 
CCC.
    (c) Producers must be prevented from planting more than 35 percent 
of the total eligible acreage intended for planting to the eligible crop 
and in the case of multiple planting, more than 35 percent of the total 
eligible acres intended to be planted within the applicable planting 
period.
    (d) Eligible prevented planting acreage will be determined on the 
basis of the producer's intent to plant the crop acreage, and possession 
of, or access to, resources to plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as 
applicable.
    (e) Acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage includes, but 
is not limited to:
    (1) Acreage which planting history or conservation plans indicate 
would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes; and

planting to the eligible crop by the producer's share;
    (2) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 
65 percent;
    (3) Subtracting the total acres planted from the product of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (4) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(3) of this section by 
50 percent of the producer's approved yield;
    (5) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(4) of this section by 
the final payment price for the producer's crop as calculated by the 
agency under Sec. 1437.11.
    (b) Yields for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
calculated in the same manner as for low-yield claims.

<R05>
Sec. 1437.301  Value loss.

    (a) Special provisions are required to assess losses and calculate 
assistance for a few crops and commodities which do not lend themselves 
to yield loss situations. Assistance for these commodities is calculated 
based on the loss of value at the time of disaster. The agency shall 
determine which crops shall be treated as value-loss crops, but unless 
otherwise announced, such crops shall be limited to those identified in 
Sec. Sec. 1437.303 through 1437.309 as value loss crops. Lost 
productions of value loss crops shall be compensable only under this 
subpart.
    (b) The crop year for all value loss crops is October 1 through 
September 30.
    (c) Producers must file an application for coverage in accordance 
with Sec. 1437.6, and must:
    (1) Provide a report of the crop, commodity, and facility to CCC for 
the acreage or facility, in a form prescribed by CCC, no later than the 
beginning of the crop year.
    (2) Maintain a verifiable inventory of the eligible crop throughout 
the crop year; and
    (3) Provide an accurate accounting of the inventory, as required by 
CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.302  Determining payments.

    Subject to all restrictions and the availability of funds, value 
loss payments for qualifying losses will be determined by:
    (a) Multiplying the field market value of the crop before the 
disaster by 50 percent;
    (b) Subtracting the sum of the field market value after the disaster 
and value of ineligible causes of loss from the result from paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section;
    (c) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(2) of this section by 
the producer's share;
    (d) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(3) of this section by 
55 percent plus whatever factor deemed appropriate to reflect savings 
from non-harvesting of the damaged crop or other factors as appropriate;
    (e) Multiplying the salvage value by the producer's share;
    (f) Subtracting the result from paragraph (a)(5) of this section 
from the result from paragraph (a)(4) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.303  Aquaculture, including ornamental fish.

    (a) Aquaculture is a value loss crop and is compensable only in 
accord with restrictions set in this section. Eligible aquacultural 
species shall only include:
    (1) Any species of aquatic organisms grown as food for human 
consumption as determined by CCC.
    (2) Fish raised as feed for other fish that are consumed by humans;

    (3) Ornamental fish propagated and reared in an aquatic medium.
    (b) The aquacultural facility must be:
    (1) A commercial enterprise on private property;
    (2) Owned or leased by the producer, with readily identifiable 
boundaries; and
    (3) Managed and maintained using good aquacultural growing 
practices.
    (c) Producers must:
    (1) Ensure adequate and proper flood prevention, growing medium, 
fertilization or feeding, irrigation and water quality, predator 
control, and disease control; and
    (2) Have control of the waterbed.
    (d) Eligible aquacultural species must be:
    (1) Placed in the facility and not be indigenous to the facility; 
and
    (2) Kept in a controlled environment; and
    (3) Planted or seeded in containers, wire baskets, net pens, or 
similar device designed for the protection and containment of the seeded 
aquacultural species.
    (e) In the crop year in which a notice of loss is filed, producers 
may be required, at the discretion of CCC, to provide evidence that the 
aquacultural species are produced in a facility in accordance with 
paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1437.304  Floriculture.

    (a) Floriculture, except for seed crops as specified in paragraph 
(d) of this section, is a value loss crop and is compensable only in 
accord with restrictions set in this section. Eligible floriculture 
shall be limited to commercial production of:
    (1) Field-grown flowers, including flowers grown in containers or 
other growing medium maintained in a field setting according to industry 
standards, as determined by CCC; and
    (2) Tubers and bulbs, for use as propagation stock of eligible

    (c) Eligible floriculture must be grown in a region or controlled 
environment conducive to the successful production of flowers, tubers, 
and bulbs, as determined by CCC.
    (d) Claims on losses on the production of flower seed for 
propagation of eligible floriculture plants will not be treated under 
``value loss'' rules, but under the rules for normal production low 
yield crops under subpart B of this part.
    (e) The facility or acreage for eligible floriculture must be 
managed and maintained using good floriculture growing practices. At a 
minimum, producers are responsible for providing a controlled 
environment and must ensure adequate and proper fertilization, 
irrigation, weed control, insect and disease control, and rodent and 
wildlife control.

Subpart E_Determining Coverage of Forage Intended for Animal Consumption


<R05>
Sec. 1437.401  Forage.

    (a) Forage eligible to generate benefits under this part is limited 
to vegetation produced for animal consumption in a commercial operation 
using acceptable farming, pasture and range management practices for the 
location necessary to sustain sufficient quality and quantity of the 
vegetation so as to

[[Page 563]]

be suitable for grazing livestock or mechanical harvest. Forage to be 
mechanically harvested shall be treated under the rules for low-yield 
crops as calculated under Sec. 1437.103. Claims on forage for grazing 
benefits will, contrariwise, be determined under this subpart. However, 
the provisions in this subpart shall govern for all claims including 
forage for mechanical harvest.
    (b) Producers of forage must, in addition to the records required in 
Sec. 1437.7, specify the intended method of harvest of all acreage 
intended as forage for livestock consumption as either mechanically or 
grazed.
    (c) Producers must, in the administrative FSA office for the unit, 
request an appraisal prior to the onset of grazing of any intended 
mechanically harvested forage acreage that will be both mechanically 
harvested and grazed.
    (d) Forage acreage reported to FSA as intended to be mechanically 
harvested which is subsequently completely grazed will be considered for 
crop definition purposes as mechanically harvested. Expected production 
of the specific acreage will be calculated on the basis of carrying 
capacity.
    (e) Small grain forage is the specific acreage of wheat, barley, 
oats, triticale, or rye intended for use as forage. Small grain forage 
shall be considered separate crops and distinct from any other forage 
commodities and other intended uses of the small grain commodity. In 
addition to the records required in Sec. 1437.7 producers must specify 
whether the intended forage crop is intended for fall/winter, spring, or 
total season forage. In addition to other eligibility requirements, CCC 
will consider other factors, such as, water sources and available 
fencing, and adequate fertilization to determine small grain forage 
eligibility, yields, and production.
    (f) CCC will establish forage losses of acreage intended to be 
grazed on the basis of:
    (1) For improved pasture, as determined by CCC, a similar percentage 
of loss of mechanically harvested forage acreage on the farm, or similar 
farms in the area; or
    (2) For native pasture, as determined by CCC, the percentage of loss 
as determined by two independent assessments of pasture conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.402  Carrying capacity.

    (a) CCC will establish a carrying capacity for all grazed forage 
present in the county for purposes of administering this program and to 
that end:
    (1) Multiple carrying capacities may be determined for a specific 
vegetation if factors, such as soil type, elevation, and topography, 
result in a significant difference of carrying capacity within the 
county.
    (2) CCC may establish separate carrying capacities for irrigated and 
non-irrigated forage acreage when acreage of traditionally irrigated 
forage (forage actually irrigated 3 of the last 5 crop years) is present 
in the county.
    (b) Producers may provide evidence that unit forage management and 
maintenance practices are improvements over those practices generally 
associated with the established carrying capacity. Based on this 
evidence, CCC may adjust the expected AUD for the specific forage 
acreage upward for the crop year NAP assistance is requested by:
    (1) Three percent when at least 1 practice was completed at least 1 
time in the previous 5 crop years and such practice can be expected to 
have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop 
year NAP assistance is requested;
    (2) Five percent when 2 or more practices were completed at least 1 
time in the previous 5 crop years and such practices can be expected to 
have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop 
year NAP assistance is requested; and
    (3) Greater than 5 percent when producers provide acceptable 
records, as determined by CCC, of higher forage production or an 
increase in animal units supported on the specific forage acreage in 3 
of the 5 crop years immediately before the crop year NAP assistance is 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.403  Determining payments.

    Subject to payment limits, availability of funds, and other limits 
as

[[Page 564]]

may apply, payments for losses of forage reported to FSA as intended to 
be grazed will be determined by:
    (a) Multiplying the eligible acreage by the producer's share;
    (b) Dividing the result from paragraph (a) of this section by the 
carrying capacity or adjusted per day carrying capacity established for 
the specific acreage, as determined by CCC;
    (c) Multiplying the result from paragraph (b) of this section by the 
number of days established as the grazing period;
    (d) Adding adjustments of AUD for practices and production to the 
product of paragraph (c) of this section;
    (e) Multiplying the result from paragraph (d) of this section by the 
applicable percentage of loss established by CCC;
    (f) Multiplying the amount of AUD lost to other causes, as 
determined by CCC, by the producer's share;
    (g) Subtracting the result from paragraph (f) of this section from 
the result from paragraph (e) of this section;
    (h) Multiplying the result from paragraph (d) of this section by 
0.50;
    (i) Subtracting the result from paragraph (h) of this section from 
the result from paragraph (g) of this section; and
    (j) Multiplying the result from paragraph (i) of this section by the 
AUD value established in accordance with Sec. 1437.11, and then by 55 
percent.

Sec. 1437.404  Information collection requirements under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act; OMB control number.

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required

charges CCC for funds, as of the date CCC made such benefits. Such 
interest that is determined to be due CCC shall accrue from the date 
such benefits were made available by CCC to the date of repayment or the 
date interest increases in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter. 
CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC determines that the cause 
of the erroneous determination was not due to any action of the 
livestock owner or other individual or entity receiving benefits.
    (d) Interest otherwise determined due in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section may be waived with respect to refunds required of 
the owner or other program recipient because of unintentional misaction 
on the part of the owner or other individual or entity, as determined by 
CCC.
    (e) Late payment interest shall be assessed on all refunds in 
accordance with the provisions of, and subject to the rates prescribed 
in part 1403 of this chapter.
    (f) Individuals or entities who are a party to any program operated 
under this part must refund to CCC any excess payments made by CCC with 
respect to such program.
    (g) In the event that any request for assistance or payment under 
this part was established as a result of erroneous information or a 
miscalculation, the assistance or payment shall be recomputed and any 
excess refunded with applicable interest.

<R05>
Sec. 1439.100  Administration.

    (a) The regulations in this part will be administered under the 
general supervision and direction of the Executive Vice President, 
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and the Deputy Administrator, for 
Farm Programs, Farm Service Agency (FSA). In the field, the regulations 
in this part will be administered by the FSA State and county 
committees.
    (b) State executive directors, county executive directors, and State 
and county committees do not have the authority to modify or waive any 
of the provisions in this part unless specifically authorized by the 
Deputy Administrator.
    (c) The State committee may take any action authorized or required 
by this part to be taken by the county committee that has not been taken 
by such committee, such as:
    (1) Correct or require a county committee to correct any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with this part; 
or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No delegation herein to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, or the Deputy 
Administrator from determining any question arising under this part or 
from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county 
committee.
    (e) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine 
eligibility for program benefits. Although participation in the 2002 
Livestock Assistance Program (2002 LAP) is voluntary, program benefits 
will not be provided unless the participant furnishes all requested 
data.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.101  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to 
the 2002 LAP authorized by Public Law 108-7. Program regulations for 
prior livestock assistance programs can be found at 7 CFR part 1439 as 
it was published in 7 CFR chapet XIV revised as of January 1, 2001. 
Benefits will be provided to eligible livestock producers in the United 
States under this subpart in declared disaster counties that were 
subsequently approved for relief under this part by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (b) During the 2001 or 2002 calendar years, for 2002 LAP, a producer 
must be in a disaster county that was also approved and determined by 
the Deputy Administrator as having suffered losses during calendar year 
2001 or 2002. Contiguous counties that were not designated as a disaster 
county in their own right will not be eligible for participation in 2002 
LAP under this subpart. Grazing losses must have occurred on native and 
improved pasture with permanent vegetative cover and other crops planted 
specifically for the sole purpose of providing grazing for livestock, 
but such losses do not include losses on, or with respect to, seeded 
small grain forage crops.
    (c) To be eligible for assistance under this subpart, a livestock 
producer's pastures must have suffered at least a 40-percent loss of 
normal carrying capacity for a minimum of 3 consecutive months during 
the relevant calendar year. The percent of loss eligible for 
compensation shall not exceed the maximum percentage of grazing loss for 
the county as determined by the

[[Page 569]]

county committee. In addition, the producer will not be compensated for 
that part of any loss that would represent payment of a loss greater 
than 80 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.102  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section shall be applicable for 
all purposes of administering this subpart. The definitions in Sec. 
1439.3 shall also be applicable, except where those definitions conflict 
with the definitions set forth in this subpart, in which case the 
definitions in this section will apply.
    Application means the Livestock Assistance Program Application. The 
Application is available at county FSA offices.
    Disaster county means a county included in the geographic area 
covered by a qualifying natural disaster declaration for calendar year 
2001 or calendar year 2002 for which the request for such declaration 
was submitted during the period beginning on January 1, 2001, and ending 
February 20, 2003, and subsequently approved. The term disaster county 
means the county where the disaster occurred and does not include a 
contiguous county.
    Qualifying natural disaster declaration means:
    (1) A natural disaster declared by the Secretary under section 
321(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 
1961(a)); or
    (2) A major disaster or emergency designated by the President under 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 
U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).
    Livestock means beef and dairy cattle, buffalo and beefalo (when 
maintained on the same basis as beef cattle), sheep, goats, swine, and 
equine animals where such equine animals are used commercially for human 
food or kept for the production of food or fiber on the owner's farm.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.103  Application process.

    (a) Livestock producers must submit a completed application prior to 
the close of business on the date established and announced by the 
Deputy Administrator. The application and any other supporting 
documentation shall be submitted to the county FSA office with 
administrative authority over a producer's eligible grazing land or to 
the county FSA office that maintains the farm records for the livestock 
producer.
    (b) Livestock producers shall certify as to the accuracy of all the 
information contained in the application, and provide any other 
information that CCC determines to be necessary to determine the 
livestock producer's eligibility.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.104  County committee determinations of general applicability.

    (a) County committees shall determine whether due to natural 
disasters their county has suffered a 40-percent loss affecting pasture 
and normal grazing crops for at least 3 consecutive months during 
calendar year 2001 for 2001 eligibility and during calendar year 2002 
for 2002 eligibility. In making this determination, county committees, 
using the best information available from sources including but not 
limited to: the Extension Service, the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service; the Drought Monitor; the Palmer Drought Index; and general 
knowledge of local rainfall data, pasture losses, grazing livestock 
movement out of county, abnormal supplemental feeding practices for 
livestock on pasture and liquidation of grazing livestock, shall 
determine the percentage of grazing losses for pastures on a county-wide 
basis. The county committee shall submit rainfall data, percentage of 
grazing losses for each general type of pasture, and the weighted 
average percentage of grazing loss for the county, with State committee 
concurrence, to the Deputy Administrator. The maximum grazing losses the 
county committees shall submit is 80 percent. These determinations shall 
be subject to review and approval of the Deputy Administrator. For 
purposes of this subpart, such counties are called ``eligible 
counties.''
    (b) In each eligible county, the county committee shall determine an 
LAP crop year. The LAP crop year shall be that period of time in a 
calendar year that begins with the date grazing of new growth pasture 
normally begins and ends on the date grazing without supplemental 
feeding normally ends in the county.

[[Page 570]]

    (c) In and for each eligible county, the county committee shall 
determine normal carrying capacities for each type of grazing or pasture 
during the LAP crop year. The normal carrying capacity for the LAP crop 
year shall be the normal carrying capacity the county committee 
determines could be expected from pasture and normal grazing crops for 
livestock for the LAP crop year if a natural disaster had not diminished 
the production of these grazing crops.
    (d) In each eligible county, the county committee shall determine 
the payment period for the county. The payment period for the county 
shall be the period of time during the county's LAP crop year where for 
3 consecutive months during 2001 or 2002, the carrying capacity for 
grazing land or pasture was reduced by 40 percent or more from the 
normal carrying capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.105  Loss criteria.

    (a) Grazing land for which a livestock producer requests benefits 
must be within the physical boundary of a disaster county. Livestock 
producers in unapproved counties contiguous to an eligible county will 
not receive benefits under this subpart.
    (b) To be eligible for benefits under this subpart, a livestock 
producer in an eligible county must have suffered a loss of grazing 
production equivalent to at least a 40-percent loss of normal carrying 
capacity for a minimum of 3 consecutive months.
    (c) A producer shall specify each type of pasture and percentage of 
loss suffered by each type on the application. In establishing the 
percentage of grazing loss, producers shall consider the amount of 
available grazing production during the LAP crop year, whether more than 
the normal acreage of grazing land was required to support livestock 
during the LAP crop year, and whether supplemental feeding of livestock 
began earlier or later than normal.
    (d) The county committee shall determine the producer's grazing loss 
and shall consider the amount of available grazing production during the 
LAP crop year, whether more than the normal acreage of grazing land was 
required to support livestock during the LAP crop year, and whether 
supplemental feeding of livestock began earlier or later than normal. 
The county committee shall request the producer to provide proof of loss 
of grazing production if the county committee determines the producer's 
certified loss exceeds other similarly situated livestock producers.
    (e) The percentage of loss claimed by a livestock producer shall not 
exceed the maximum allowable percentage of grazing loss for the county 
as determined by the county committee in accordance with Sec. 
1439.104(a). Livestock producers will not receive benefits under this 
subpart for any portion of their loss that exceeds 80 percent of normal 
carrying capacity.
    (f) Conservation Reserve Program acres released for haying or 
grazing and seeded small grain forage crops shall not be used to 
calculate losses under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.106  Livestock producer eligibility.

    (a) Only one livestock producer will be eligible for benefits under 
this subpart with respect to an individual animal.
    (b) Only owners, cash lessees, or share lessees of livestock who 
themselves provide the pasture or grazing land, including cash leased 
pasture or grazing land, for the livestock may be considered as 
livestock producers eligible to apply for benefits under this subpart.
    (c) An owner, or cash or share lessee of livestock who uses another 
person to provide pasture or grazing land on a rate-of-gain basis is not 
considered to be the livestock producer eligible to apply for benefits 
under this subpart.
    (d) An owner who pledges livestock as security for a loan shall be 
considered as the person eligible to apply for benefits under this 
subpart if all other requirements of this part are met. Livestock leased 
or being purchased under a contractual agreement that has been in effect 
at least 3 months and establishes an interest for the lessee in such 
livestock shall be considered as being owned by the lessee.
    (e) Livestock must have been owned or leased for at least 3 months 
before becoming eligible for payment.

[[Page 571]]

    (f) The following entities are not eligible for benefits under this 
subpart:
    (1) State or local governments or subdivisions thereof; or
    (2) Any individual or entity who is a foreign person as determined 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1400.501 and 1400.502 of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.107  Calculation of assistance.

    (a) The value of LAP assistance determined with respect to a 
livestock producer for each type and weight class of livestock owned or 
leased by such producer shall be the lesser of the amount calculated 
under paragraph (b) of this section (the total value of lost feed needs 
for eligible livestock) or calculated under paragraph (c) of this 
section (the total value of lost eligible pasture).
    (b) The total value of lost feed needs shall be the amount obtained 
by multiplying:
    (1) The number of days in the payment period the livestock are owned 
or, in the case of purchased livestock, meet the 3-month ownership 
requirement; by
    (2) The number of pounds of corn-equivalent per day, as established 
by CCC, that is determined necessary to provide the energy requirements 
established for the weight class and type of livestock; by
    (3) The 5-year national average market price for corn, as determined 
($1.92 bushel or $0.0342857 per pound); by
    (4) The number of eligible animals of each type and weight range of 
livestock owned or leased by the person; by
    (5) The percent of the producer's grazing loss during the relevant 
period as certified by the producer and approved by the county committee 
in accordance with Sec. 1439.105.
    (c) The total value of lost eligible pasture shall be the amounts 
for each type of pasture calculated by:
    (1) Dividing the number of acres of each pasture type by the 
carrying capacity established for the pasture, and multiplying the 
result by:
    (2) The 5-year national average market price for corn, as determined 
($1.92 bushel or $0.0342857 per pound); by
    (3) The daily feed grain equivalent per animal (15.7 pounds of corn 
necessary for a beef cow, factored for the weight class and type of 
livestock, as determined by CCC), by
    (4) The applicable number of days in the LAP payment period; by
    (5) The percent of the producer's grazing loss during the relevant 
period as certified by the producer and approved by the county committee 
in accordance with Sec. 1439.105.
    (d) The final payment shall be the smaller of paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section and from the final payment amount shall be subtracted 
the sum of the amounts received by the producer under the Livestock 
Compensation Program, as published in the Federal Register on October 
10, 2002 (67 FR 63070), and the 2002 Cattle Feed Program, as published 
on September 3, 2002 (67 FR 56260). The final payment shall not exceed 
50 percent of the smaller of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section 
determined prior to subtracting the amounts received by the producer 
under the Livestock Compensation Program, as published in the Federal 
Register on October 10, 2002 (67 FR 63070), the 2002 Cattle Feed 
Program, as published on September 3, 2002 (67 FR 56260), and the 
Livestock Compensation Program II, as published on May 5, 2003 (68 FR 
23688).
    (e) The final payment calculated in paragraph (d) of this section 
shall be multiplied by the national factor if required under Sec. 
1439.108.
    (f) Seeded small grain forage crops shall not be counted as grazing 
land under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to supporting 
eligible livestock.
    (g) The number of equine animals that are used to calculate benefits 
under this subpart and in paragraph (a) of this section are limited to 
the number actually needed to produce food and fiber on the producer's 
farm or to breed horses and mules to be used to produce food and fiber 
on the owner's farm, and shall not include animals that are used for 
recreational purposes or are running wild or uncontrolled on land owned 
or leased by the owner.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.108  Availability of funds.

    In the event that the total amount of claims submitted under this

and the owner was not eligible for such assistance. Such interest shall 
be charged at the rate of interest that the United States Treasury 
charges CCC for funds, as of the date CCC made such benefits. Such 
interest that is determined to be due CCC shall accrue from the date 
such benefits were made available by CCC to the date of repayment or the 
date interest increases in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.

programs'', without limitation, such power will be considered to extend 
to this program unless by July 10, 2003 the person granting the power 
notifies the local FSA office for the control county that the grantee of 
the power is not authorized to handle transactions for this program for

actions for damages in favor of CCC, or the United States, as may be 
permitted by law.

waive the demand that could otherwise be made for refunds.
    (c) Payments under this subpart are subject to provisions contained 
in Subpart A of this part including, but not limited to provisions 
concerning misrepresentations, payment limitations, limitations on 
eligibility tied to the person's gross income, and refunds to CCC, 
liens, assignment of payments, and appeals, and maintenance of books and 
records. In addition, other parts of this chapter and of chapter VII of 
this title relating to payments in event of death, the handling of 
claims, and other matters may apply, as may other provisions of law and 
regulation.
    (d) Any payments not earned that have been paid must be returned

    (e) No interest will be paid or accrue on benefits under this 
subpart that are delayed or otherwise not timely issued unless otherwise 
mandated by law.
    (f) Nothing in this subpart shall require a commitment of funds to 
this subpart in excess of that determined to be appropriate by the 
Deputy Administrator and/or CCC.
    (g) Any payment otherwise due under this subpart will be reduced to 
the extent that it is determined that such payment produces a duplicate 
benefit under another program operated by the Department of Agriculture

purposes of the program.
    (h) In no instance may the amount expended under this subpart exceed 
$39.912 million.
    (i) Payments under this subpart shall be made without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found at part 1403 of this chapter 
shall be applicable to PRP contract payments.

accordance with regulations governing assignment of payment found at 
part 1404 of this chapter.

effective date of this subpart, a producer has signed a power of 
attorney on an approved FSA-211 for a person or entity indicating that 
such power shall extend to ``all above programs'', without limitation, 
such power will be considered to extend to this program unless by April 
2, 2001 the person granting the power notifies the local FSA office for 
the control county that the grantee of the power is not authorized to 
handle transactions for this program for the grantor.
    (l) Livestock producers or any other individual or entity seeking or 
receiving assistance under this part shall maintain and retain records 
that will permit verification of PRP practice completion for at least 3

records by a duly authorized representative of the United States 
Government shall be permitted at any time during business hours.

be subject to such other remedies as may be allowed by law, if, with 
respect to the PRP, it is determined by the State committee or the 
county committee or an official of FSA that such person has:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the

    (a) FSA county committees shall determine whether that county was 
determined eligible under the 1998 FCP, and whether the land has been 
unusable from October 1, 1999 through September 30, 2000 due to

benefits under this subpart.
    (b) To be eligible for benefits under this subpart, a producer in an 
eligible county must have land in a county which is eligible for 
payment. Such land, to be eligible for payment must meet all of the 
following criteria:
    (1) The land is cropland or pasture land used for the production of 
feed for livestock (haying, grazing, or feed grain production) or other 
agricultural use in one or more years during the period beginning 
October 1, 1991, through September 30, 1999;
    (2) The land is inaccessible or unable to be used for crop 
production, grazing, or haying because of flooding or excess

[[Page 581]]

moisture during all of the period beginning October 1, 1999, through 
September 30, 2000 unless some other period is established as the 2000-
crop year for the commodity by the Deputy Administrator;
    (3) The land was not used for planting during October 1, 1999, 
through September 30, 2000;
    (4) The land has been owned, leased or under a binding cash lease by 
the producer continuously since October 1, 1999;
    (5) The land is a contiguous parcel of land with an area equal to 
one acre or more;
    (6) The land was not, except as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, the subject of, nor will be the subject of, any other 
federal payment for activities or lack of activity during the period 
October 1, 1999, through September 30, 2000, whether or not disaster-
related, with the exception of the production flexibility contract (PFC) 
program payments received under 7 CFR part 1412. This prohibition 
includes but is not limited to other payments under this part, or 
payments under the Conservation Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1410), the 
Wetlands Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1467), any Emergency Watershed 
Protection Program, or Federal Easement Program.
    (c) On Form CCC-454 producers shall be required to certify by tract 
on each farm the number of flooded cropland and non-cropland acres for 
the farm in 2000 and the number of flooded cropland and non-cropland 
acres in 1992. To establish the acreage eligible for payment, flooded 
land certified for 1992 for each type shall be subtracted from the 
flooded land certified for 2000 for the applicable type. The difference 
will be the acreages of cropland and non-cropland subject to flooding 
and eligible for FCP payment, except that the difference may be adjusted 
as needed to ensure, to the extent practicable, an accurate estimate of 
the net increased flooding on the farm after October 1, 1993.
    (d) All determinations as to the amount of land eligible for 
enrollment and compensation under this subpart are subject to approval 
by the county committee.

marketing association.
    (2) Approval. The determination of whether a handler will be

the registration was filed and, in the case of approval, such approval 
shall be evidenced by a handler registration number that is issued by 
such marketing association.
    (b) Handler of loan peanuts. To handle loan peanuts, either quota or 
additional, a person must be approved as a handler and must contract 
with the marketing association on form CCC-1028 or form CCC-1028-A to

    (a) Indebtedness to the United States due to peanut marketing 
penalties. As provided in part 729 of this title, if a producer is 
indebted to the United States for a peanut marketing penalty, such 
penalty shall result in a lien in favor of the United States on any 
peanuts in which such producer has an interest and any person who 
acquires peanuts from such producer shall be considered to have notice 
of such lien at the time such lien becomes attached. Except with respect 
to any lien that was perfected before the peanut poundage quota lien 
became attached in those cases not involving peanuts placed in the price 
support loan inventory, any person who acquires peanuts from such 
producer shall deduct the lien amount plus any applicable interest from 
the proceeds otherwise due to such producer as a result of the 
acquisition of the peanuts. Any deducted amount shall be paid to CCC in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator. In the 
event a required deduction is not made from

shall be liable to CCC for the amount of the lien, to the extent of the 
market value of such peanuts or proceeds of the peanuts whichever is 
higher.
    (b) Farmers Home Administration or Farm Service Agency lien. If a 
Farmers Home Administration or Farm Service Agency lien has been 
recorded on the marketing card that was issued for the use of a producer 
when marketing peanuts, the purchaser of such peanuts shall make the 
check, for the proceeds from such peanuts, payable jointly to the 
producer and the Farm Service Agency. However, if a peanut poundage 
quota lien was also recorded on the marketing card against such 
producer, the check shall be made payable jointly to the producer, CCC 
and the Farm Service Agency.

Sec. 1446.306  Commingling of peanuts.

    To facilitate handling and marketing, unless prohibited by a 
handler's storage contract with the marketing association, a handler may 
store farmers stock loan peanuts on a commingled basis with peanuts 
owned by such handler if such peanuts are of like crop, type, area, and 
segregation.
    (a) Accounting for commingled peanuts. Except for peanuts purchased 
from CCC for domestic edible use on an in-grade

[[Page 594]]

and in-weight basis, commingled peanuts shall be exchanged on a dollar 
value basis. Accordingly, when loan peanuts are removed from the 
warehouse they must be inspected as farmers stock peanuts by an 
inspector and accounted for on a dollar value, based on the quota loan 
rate, less a one-time adjustment for shrinkage for each crop.
    (b) Dollar value shrinkage adjustment. For peanuts that are graded 
out and accounted for:
    (1) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (i) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and

placed in commingled storage and that is issued for any peanuts removed 
from storage.

deliver all such peanuts in accordance with good commercial practice and 
any instructions provided by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.307  Disaster transfer of Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 
peanuts from additional loan to quota loan.

    (a) Transfer of Segregation 2 and Segregation 3 peanuts. Except as 
otherwise provided in this section, after a producer has completed 
marketing all peanuts produced on the farm, such producer may transfer a 
loan on Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 additional peanuts to a quota 
loan.
    (b) Limitation of amount eligible for transfer. A transfer made in 
accordance with this section shall not exceed the smaller of:
    (1) The difference between:
    (i) The total quantity of Segregation 1 peanuts marketed from the 
farm, plus the amount of peanuts retained on the farm for seed or other 
use, and
    (ii) The effective farm poundage quota, excluding quota pounds 
transferred to the farm in the fall; or
    (2) Twenty-five percent of the effective farm poundage quota, 
excluding quota pounds transferred to the farm in the fall.
    (c) Offset of CCC losses. As provided in this part, if a producer 
transfers an additional loan to a quota loan in accordance with the 
provisions of this section, any pool proceeds otherwise due such 
producer from peanuts in another pool shall be reduced by the amount of 
any losses to CCC on the peanuts so transferred.
    (d) Loan value for transferred peanuts--(1) Segregation 2 peanuts. 
The quota loan value for any lot of Segregation 2 peanuts transferred 
from an additional loan to a quota loan shall be determined by 
multiplying 70 percent of the quota loan rate that otherwise would have 
been applicable for such lot of peanuts as quota peanuts, exclusive of 
any discount for damaged kernels, by the net weight of peanuts being 
transferred and deducting from the result the amount of any special 
discount that may apply for Segregation 2 peanuts transferred in 
accordance with this section.
    (2) Segregation 3 peanuts. The quota loan value for any lot of 
Segregation 3 peanuts transferred from an additional loan to a quota 
loan shall be determined by multiplying 70 percent of the quota loan 
rate that otherwise would have been applicable for such lot of peanuts 
as quota peanuts, exclusive of any discount for damaged kernels, by the 
net weight of peanuts being transferred and deducting from the result 
the amount of any special discount that may apply for Segregation 3 
peanuts transferred in accordance with this section.
    (e) Transfer provisions--(1) Where to apply. Producers who are 
eligible to transfer additional loan peanuts to the quota loan pool in 
accordance with the provisions of this section may apply for such 
transfers with the county FSA office.
    (2) Determination of the amount eligible for transfer. The county 
office shall determine, in accordance with paragraph

[[Page 595]]

(b) of this section, the quantity of additional peanuts which are 
eligible for transfer.
    (3) Designation of peanuts to be transferred. The producer must 
indicate to the county office the net weight and applicable form FSA-
1007 serial numbers for the peanuts to be transferred.
    (4) Applicability of marketings. Any peanuts that are transferred 
from an additional loan to a quota loan shall be considered as 
marketings of quota peanuts and the applicable records shall be 
appropriately adjusted.
    (f) Supplemental loan payment. The difference between the additional 
and quota loan rates for such peanuts, less the appropriate adjustment 
for the marketing assessment, shall be advanced by the marketing 
association to the applicable producer.

Sec. 1446.308  Loan pools.

    (a) Establishment of pools. (1) Each marketing association shall 
establish six separate loan pools; one for each of the three 
segregations of additional peanuts and one for each of the three 
segregations for quota peanuts. These pools shall be formed without 
regard to the type of peanuts (Runner, Virginia, Spanish, or Valencia) 
involved. However, the SWPGA shall also establish 12 separate loan pools 
for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico, namely, for bright hull 
peanuts and for dark hull peanuts separately, to include for each of 
them separate, by segregation, additional peanuts and quota peanuts 
pools. Each marketing association shall maintain separate, complete and 
accurate records for each loan pool that is established by the marketing 
association.
    (2) Eligibility to participate in New Mexico Pools--(i) In general. 
Except as provided in clause (a)(2)(ii) of this section, in the case of 
the 1996 and subsequent crops, Valencia peanuts not physically produced 
in the State of New Mexico shall not be eligible to participate in the 
pools of the State even if the farm on which the peanuts are produced is 
constituted for administrative purposes within the State of New Mexico.
    (ii) Exception. A producer of Valencia peanuts may enter Valencia 
peanuts that are physically produced in Texas into the pools for New 
Mexico in a quantity not greater than the average annual quantity of the 
peanuts that the producer entered into the New Mexico pools for the 1990 
through 1995 crops; however, to qualify, the peanuts must be produced on 
the same farm on which the peanuts were produced during the base years 
of 1990 through 1995.
    (b) Net gains for quota pools. Net gains from peanuts in each quota 
pool shall consist of the amount by which the proceeds from the sale of 
the peanuts in such pool are in excess of the indebtedness on the 
peanuts in such pool.
    (c) Net gains for additional pool. Net gains for peanuts in each 
additional pool shall consist of:
    (1) The net gains which are in excess of the indebtedness on the 
peanuts placed in such pool; less
    (2) Any amount as provided in paragraph (d) of this section that is 
allocated to offset any loss on the pools for Segregation 1 quota 
peanuts, and any other amount properly offset.
    (d) Recovery of losses in quota area loan pools. (1) If the loan 
indebtedness on the peanuts in a quota area pool exceeds the proceeds 
from the sale of the peanuts in such pool, such excess shall be 
recovered using the following sources in the following order of 
priority:
    (i) Proceeds due any individual producer from any pool, as a result 
of the transfer of peanuts for pricing purposes from an additional loan 
pool to a quota loan pool, pursuant to the provisions in Sec. 1446.307.
    (ii) Gains of any producer in the same pool, by the amount of pool 
gains attributed to the same producer from the sale of additional 
peanuts for domestic and export edible use.
    (iii) Gains or profits resulting from the sale of additional 
peanuts, other than Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico in separate 
type pools established under paragraph (a) of this section, in the same 
marketing area for domestic edible use, that are owned or controlled by 
CCC. This paragraph shall not apply to gains or profits from

[[Page 596]]

the sale of peanuts that were produced on farms with 1 acre or less of 
peanut production.
    (iv) Marketing assessments, collected from producers under Sec. 
729.316 of this title, that the Secretary determines are necessary to 
cover losses in area quota pools.
    (v) Gains or profits from quota pools in other marketing areas, 
other than separate type pools established under paragraph (a) of this 
section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico.
    (vi) Gains or profits resulting from the sale of additional peanuts 
in other marketing areas, other than Valencia peanuts produced in New 
Mexico in separate type pools established under paragraph (a) of this 
section, for domestic edible use, that are owned or controlled by CCC. 
This paragraph shall not apply to gains or profits from the sale of 
peanuts that were produced on farms with 1 acre or less of peanut 
production.
    (vii) Marketing assessments, collected from handlers under Sec. 
729.316 of this title, that the Secretary determines are necessary to 
cover losses in area quota pools.
    (viii) Increased marketing assessments on quota peanuts in the 
production area covered by the pool, which shall be assessed as needed 
and collected from producers under Sec. 729.317 of this title.
    (2) The exceptions provided for Valencia peanuts in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section shall only apply as to prevent offsets between pools for 
each of the Valencia types (bright-hull and dark-hull) for New Mexico 
and other peanuts.
    (e) Pool distribution. (1) Net gains as determined in accordance 
with this section on peanuts in each area pool shall be distributed to 
each producer who placed peanuts in that pool in proportion to the 
dollar value of peanuts placed in such pool by that producer, except 
that the proceeds available for the amount of distribution shall be 
subject to any other conditions and offsets set forth in this section; 
and
    (2) Distributions shall not be assigned to any other party.

losses in accordance with this section for loan pools for quota and 
additional peanuts, the term ``indebtedness'' with respect to a pool

Sec. 1446.309  Immediate buyback and sale of loan peanuts to the storing 
handler.

    (a) ``Immediate buyback'' purchase of additional peanuts--(1) 
Producer consent. Except as provided in this section, if the producer of 
a lot of additional peanuts has consented to an ``immediate buyback'' of 
such peanuts by a handler, as indicated by a designation recorded on the 
form FSA-1002, the handler that acts for the marketing association in 
advancing funds to the producer for a price support loan at the 
additional loan rate on such peanuts may purchase such peanuts from the 
marketing association for domestic edible use in accordance with 
instructions from the marketing association and at a price equal to 100 
percent of the quota loan value of such peanuts plus a handling charge, 
as determined by the marketing association and approved by CCC, to cover 
all costs incurred with respect to such peanuts for inspection, 
warehousing, shrinkage, and other expenses.
    (2) Time for buyback purchase. An ``immediate buyback'' purchase may 
be made only in connection with the marketing association involved in 
the price support loan and only on the date on which the peanuts were 
delivered by the producer as collateral for a price support loan. Such 
sales are for the account of CCC.
    (3) Handler requirements. For each ``immediate buyback,'' the 
handler shall:

[[Page 597]]

    (i) Act for the marketing association by making a price support 
advance to the producer at the additional loan rate and in the same 
manner that would be applicable if an ``immediate buyback'' were not 
involved;
    (ii) If applicable, use such handler's funds to pay to the producer 
any premiums that the parties had agreed upon in order to effect the 
delivery of such peanuts;
    (iii) Pay for the peanuts by a check made payable to CCC. Such check 
must be from the handler's funds and in an amount equal to the quota 
loan value of the peanuts plus any handling charges; and
    (iv) Transmit the handler's check and the applicable form FSA-1007 
to the marketing association by midnight of the third workday (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) following the day the peanuts 
were inspected.
    (4) Domestic edible use. The handler's check and the applicable form 
FSA-1007 will identify the peanuts as additional peanuts that may be 
used for domestic edible use.
    (5) Loan pool credit. Irrespective of the segregation of such 
peanuts, the receipts from the ``immediate buyback'' sale will be 
credited to the additional loan pool for Segregation 1 peanuts and the 
peanuts will be treated as Segregation 1 peanuts for pool accounting 
purposes.
    (6) Loan pool participation. If Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 
peanuts are purchased by a handler under the ``immediate buyback'' 
provisions, the producer of such peanuts shall participate in the 
Segregation 1 additional loan pool in the same manner as would apply if 
such peanuts had been Segregation 1 peanuts.
    (7) Additional restrictions on ``immediate buyback'' sales. (i) 
Additional peanuts of the type or Segregation contracted for export or 
crushing from a farm may not be purchased from such farm under the 
``immediate buyback'' provisions of this section until all of the 
producer's contracts for additional peanuts for the relevant crop year 
have been satisfied for the type or Segregation to be used for the 
buyback, as evidenced by a contract balance of zero for that type or 
Segregation of peanuts on the farm's marketing card;
    (ii) An immediate buyback that otherwise is prohibited by paragraph 
(a)(7)(i) of this section may be permitted by CCC in the case of any 
producer on a farm who does not share in the additional peanuts for 
which there is a contract.
    (iii) An agreement between the handler and producer to void a 
contract that was approved in accordance with this part shall not reduce 
the balance shown on the producer's marketing card for contract 
additional peanuts and until such contract is renewed and satisfied the 
producer's additional peanuts of the same type or Segregation as were 
covered by that contract shall not be eligible for that crop year for 
purchase under an ``immediate buyback.''
    (b) Purchase of quota or additional loan peanuts. Quota loan 
peanuts, or additional loan peanuts that were not purchased by the 
handler under the ``immediate buyback'' provisions, may be bought for 
domestic edible use in accordance with this paragraph on an in-grade and 
in-weight basis.
    (1) In-grade and in-weight purchases. A handler may purchase loan 
peanuts, either quota or additional, on an in-grade and in-weight basis 
for domestic edible use:
    (i) Under terms and conditions established by the marketing 
association and CCC;
    (ii) If such peanuts are eligible for domestic edible use; and
    (iii) If such peanuts are stored in a warehouse that is operated by 
such handler.
    (2) Pricing. Except with respect to ``immediate buybacks,'' as 
provided for in this section, the price for peanuts purchased on an in-
grade and in-weight basis shall be determined by the marketing 
association or CCC, as applicable, for the account of CCC, but shall not 
be less than the applicable carrying charges plus, with respect to each 
lot of peanuts purchased:
    (i) 105 percent of the quota loan value that was or would be 
applicable to the quantity of loan peanuts in such lot, if paid for not 
later than December 31 of the marketing year; or

[[Page 598]]

    (ii) 107 percent of the quota loan value that was or would be 
applicable to the quantity of loan peanuts in such lot, if paid for 
after December 31 of the marketing year.

    Subpart D_Handling Contract Additional Peanuts_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1446.401  Contracts for additional peanuts for crushing or export.

    An approved handler may contract with a producer to deliver 
additional peanuts for exporting or for crushing. In order to be valid, 
the contract must meet the eligibility requirements in this section and 
must be approved by the county committee that serves the county in which 
the producing farm is located for administrative purposes.
    (a) Contract form and addendum--(1) Contract form. In order to be 
approved by the county committee, the contract must be completed on Form 
CCC-1005, Handler Contract With Producers for Purchase of Additional 
Peanuts for Crushing or Export, or on a form approved by the Executive 
Vice President, CCC, or designee, which follows the organization of the 
CCC-1005 and contains as a minimum all of the requirements provided for 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Availability of CCC-1005. The marketing association shall make 
available a form CCC-1005 to each approved handler and to any producer 
upon request.
    (3) Addenda. The handler may use an addendum to a contract form if 
such addendum neither negates nor conflicts with any provision in this 
part. Any existing addendum to the contract which relates to the 
marketing of additional peanuts must accompany the contract at the time 
the contract is filed with the county committee.
    (b) Submitting contracts for approval--(1) Eligible handlers. Only a 
handler who has been approved by the marketing association to handle 
contract additional peanuts may contract with producers to buy 
additional peanuts for crushing or exportation, or both.
    (2) Producer-handlers. A person who has been approved as a producer-
handler under part 1421 of this title may not contract with himself/
herself to purchase contract additional peanuts that he/she may produce.
    (3) Place and time for submitting. In order to be considered for 
approval, any contract between a handler and producer for the purchase 
of additional peanuts shall be completed and submitted:
    (i) Place. To the county FSA office of the county in which the farm 
is administratively located.
    (ii) Time. On or before September 15 of the year in which the crop 
is produced; except that:
    (A) Should September 15 fall on a Saturday or Sunday, or other non-
workday the contract must be submitted for approval no later than the 
last workday immediately preceding the final contracting date.

[[Page 599]]

    (B) If the Executive Vice President, CCC, determines that damaging 
weather such as drought, hail, excessive moisture, freeze, tornado, 
hurricane or excessive wind, or related condition such as insect 
infestations, plant diseases, or other deterioration of the peanut crop, 
including aflatoxin, is expected to have significant national impact on 
peanut production, the Executive Vice President may extend nationally, 
by up to 15 days, the final date for submitting contracts for approval. 
Such announcement shall be made no later than September 5 of the year in 
which the crop is produced.
    (c) Contract approval. (1) A contract between a handler and a 
producer for additional peanuts for crushing or export shall not be 
approved by the county committee, if otherwise eligible, unless the 
county committee has been notified by the State Executive Director that 
the handler has been approved to contract additional peanuts and that 
such handler has submitted the letter of credit that is required in 
accordance with the provisions in this part.
    (2) In order to be approved, the following information must appear 
on the contract:
    (i) The name and address of the operator;
    (ii) The name and address of each producer sharing in the proceeds 
of the contract additional peanuts;
    (iii) The State and County code, and farm number of the farm on 
which the additional peanuts are to be produced;
    (iv) The name, address, and registration number of the handler;
    (v) The pounds of Segregation 1, Segregation 2, and/or Segregation 3 
peanuts that are contracted;
    (vi) The final contract price to be paid by the handler and shown as 
a set percentage of the loan rate for quota peanuts of the type 
indicated on the contract; except that such final contract price shall 
not be less than the additional loan rate for the type of peanut 
indicated on the contract. A contract or an addendum to a contract that 
provides for a conditional supplemental payment to the producer will not 
be considered to negate the final contract price only if the 
supplemental payment to be made is expressed in a manner that a third 
party may determine the amount of the supplemental payment without a 
need for additional negotiations;
    (vii) A disclosure by the producer of any liens or encumbrances on 
the peanuts;
    (viii) The signature of the farm operator;
    (ix) The signature of each person having an interest as a producer 
in the contract additional peanuts that are produced on the farm;
    (x) The signature of the handler or the authorized agent of the 
handler; and

    (3) The county committee, or a person designated in writing by the 
county committee, shall approve each form CCC-1005 that conforms with 
the provisions in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.402  Approval as handler of contract additional peanuts.

    (a) General. By June 15 preceding the beginning of the marketing 
year in which such additional peanuts will be acquired, any handler who 
plans to acquire contract additional peanuts in accordance with this 
part for crushing or for exporting must:
    (1) Application. File an application with each marketing association 
that serves the area in which such handler plans to acquire contract 
additional peanuts. Such application:
    (i) Form. Must be on a form or in a format provided by the marketing 
association.
    (ii) Method of supervision. Must indicate the method of supervision, 
physical or nonphysical, selected by the handler for purposes of 
accounting for the disposition of any contract additional peanuts 
acquired by such handler.
    (2) Evidence of adequate assets and adequate facilities. Provide 
evidence that is acceptable to the marketing association and CCC that 
such handler has:
    (i) Assets. Adequate assets to assure compliance with the provisions 
in this

[[Page 600]]

part with respect to such handler's obligation to crush or export 
contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler; and
    (ii) Facilities. Adequate facilities to handle the acquisition and 
disposition of any contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler.
    (3) Letter of credit for prior crop years. Establish an irrevocable 
letter of credit, or increase any existing letter of credit applicable 
for a previous crop year, in an amount necessary to cover any 
outstanding marketing penalties on peanuts produced in such crop year 
which are still under administrative appeal or are unpaid. This 
requirement is in addition to any letter of credit requirement for the 
current year.
    (b) Approval. The marketing association, acting on behalf of CCC, 
shall approve, in accordance with this part, each application that is 
timely filed in accordance with this section, or is filed by such 
extended time as may be approved by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
provided that in either case, the applicant:
    (1) Has selected a method of supervision;
    (2) Has a U.S. address;
    (3) Has provided evidence of adequate assets and adequate facilities 
to assure compliance with the provisions in this part with respect to 
the disposition of contract additional peanuts; and
    (4) Has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) Rescission of approval. Unless the Executive Vice President, 
CCC, shall otherwise agree in writing, a handler's previous approval to 
contract for the purchase of additional peanuts for exporting or 
crushing and to receive and handle such peanuts shall be considered to 
be rescinded upon such handler's use of facilities, other than those on 
which the approval was based, to receive, store, process, or ship 
contract additional peanuts. However, a rescission will not apply if 
substituted facilities are approved by the association, in accordance 
with instructions issued by CCC, when the handler can show, as 
determined by the association subject to review by the Executive Vice 
President, that the original facilities are no longer available for use 
due to circumstances beyond the handler's control such as, but not 
limited to, fire, flood, wind damage, or mechanical failure. In the 
event of rescission of a handler's approval, any purchases of peanuts 
from producers by such handler subsequent to the rescission will be 
considered as purchases of quota peanuts and will subject the handlers 
and producers to penalties, as prescribed by this part and in 7 CFR part 
729 for marketing excess quota peanuts unless such peanuts are recorded 
on the producer's marketing card as a marketing of quota peanuts.
    (d) Cost of supervision. The handler shall bear the cost of 
supervision irrespective of the method of supervision such handler has 
chosen.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.403  Letter of credit.

    (a) Certification and financial guarantee (letter of credit)--(1) 
Certification. In order to establish a letter of credit, each handler 
must certify to the applicable marketing association the quantity of 
additional peanuts the handler expects to contract for delivery by 
producers that are served by such marketing association. The certified 
poundage will be the basis for establishing the letter of credit for the 
applicable crop. If the certified poundage is less than the actual 
contracted poundage, the letter of credit required of the handler for 
the next marketing year shall be subject to increase, as provided in 
this section.
    (2) Letter of credit. The handler must present an irrevocable letter 
of credit to each marketing association that serves the area in which a 
handler plans to contract or otherwise acquire contract additional 
peanuts. Such letter of credit shall be issued in a form and by a bank 
which is acceptable to CCC and except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section shall be submitted to the appropriate marketing association 
not later than July 31 and before marketing cards will be issued to 
producers for contract additional peanuts. Unless the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are applicable, the amount of the 
letter of credit for each area shall be equal to the amount determined 
by multiplying

[[Page 601]]

140 percent of the national average quota price support rate by, for a 
handler selecting nonphysical supervision, 8 percent, or, for a handler 
selecting physical supervision, 5 percent, of the larger of:
    (i) Ninety percent of the handler's contracted pounds as recorded on 
contracts approved by the county committee for the preceding marketing 
year and in the marketing area; or
    (ii) The amount of additional peanuts the handler estimates will be 
contracted with producers, as certified to the marketing association, 
for delivery during the current marketing year and in that marketing 
area.
    (b) Increase in letter of credit. (1) The amount of the letter of 
credit required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be increased 
for any handler:
    (i) Who has a poor performance record, as evidenced by previous 
penalty assessments for violations of the provisions of this part; or
    (ii) Who, for purposes of handling peanuts is, as determined by CCC, 
a partnership, merger, joint venture, or other similar business 
relationship having officials who were officials of an organization 
having such a record or is composed in whole or in part by merger, 
succession, consolidation, association or assimilation, of entities with 
such a record; or
    (iii) Whose total acquisition of farmers stock peanuts during the 
preceding marketing year from purchases of contract additional peanuts 
exceeded, by more than 3.0 percent, the pounds on which the letter of 
credit for the preceding marketing year was based. Nothing in this part 
shall prohibit CCC from demanding an increase in the letter of credit 
for the current year in the event the handler has significantly 
underestimated the handler's purchases for the current year.
    (2) The increase in the letter of credit shall be determined in 
accordance with the guidelines set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Guidelines for increasing letters of credit--(1) Increased 
letter of credit due to history of program violation. If the handler 
and/or related entity was assessed penalties for program violations for 
any of the previous three crop years, the percentage of the pounds of 
contracted peanuts to which the increase specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section shall be applied, shall be increased by 6 percent for each 
year of the three-year period in which such a penalty was assessed, 
except that:
    (i) Such increase for a particular crop year shall be 3 percent 
rather than 6 percent if, for all violations for that crop year:
    (A) The penalties were reduced by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
and paid; or
    (B) Less than 120 days, or such further period as established by the 
Executive Vice President, have passed since the penalty assessment was 
made by the CCC Contracting Officer.
    (ii) Previous penalty assessments, other than assessments for 
violations that involve the importation of additional peanuts, or the 
failure to properly dispose of additional peanuts, which have been paid 
shall not be considered as part of the violation history for any crop 
year if the total violations for such crop year by the handler, and 
related individuals or entities, involved less than 100,000 pounds of 
peanuts.
    (2) Waiver of increase. Notwithstanding (c)(1) of this section, at 
the discretion of the Executive Vice President, CCC, the increase 
required under this section may be waived upon the presentment of 
adequate security as determined acceptable by the Executive Vice 
President, CCC.
    (3) Inaccurate certification of additional peanuts acquired. In 
addition to the increase required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
if the actual purchase of contract additional peanuts for the previous 
marketing year exceeds, by more than 3.0 percent, the poundage on which 
the previous marketing year's letter of credit was based, the pounds 
determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section shall be increased by an amount equal to 3 times the amount of 
such excess.
    (4) Basis for determining letter of credit amount. Any letter of 
credit determination under this section shall be based upon the facts as 
they exist on June 1 of the calendar year in which the letter of credit 
is to be supplied.

[[Page 602]]

    (5) Unpaid interest. References to unpaid penalties in this section 
shall include associated unpaid interest and unpaid late payment 
charges.
    (d) Extension of time for filing letter of credit. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this section, upon a request from a handler, the 
Executive Vice President, CCC, may extend the time for filing of a 
required letter of credit if such an extension is considered necessary 
in order for the handler to have sufficient time to acquire necessary 
financing.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.404  Transfer of contracts prior to delivery.

    An approved contract, by which a handler is to purchase additional 
peanuts from a producer, may not be sold, traded, or assigned except as 
provided in this section.
    (a) Contract transfer and delivery of contracted peanuts to other 
handlers. (1) If a handler is otherwise unable to perform under any 
contract with a producer for the purchase of additional peanuts due to 
conditions beyond the handler's control, the handler and the producer 
may agree to the delivery of the peanuts to another handler under the 
terms of the original contract or under modified terms except that, the 
price, quantity, type, segregation or farm number as shown on the 
original contract may not be changed. Conditions considered beyond the 
handler's control may include, but are not limited to, insolvency, 
bankruptcy, death, or destruction of warehouse facilities.
    (2) A contract for additional peanuts shall not be transferred to 
another handler without the prior written approval of the Deputy 
Administrator. Such transfer shall be approved by the Deputy 
Administrator only if the Deputy Administrator determines that such 
transfer will not impair the effective operation of the peanut program.
    (3) If the receiving handler:
    (i) Has an existing letter of credit, such handler may increase the 
existing letter of credit to cover the total amount of farmers stock 
peanuts that is to be transferred. However, any increase must be made 
within 14 days after the transfer is approved, otherwise any increased 
letter of credit will not be considered for purposes of determining 
whether an increase will be required in the next year's letter of credit 
because of a deficiency in the letter of credit.
    (ii) Does not have an existing letter of credit, the transfer shall 
not be approved unless such handler secures an acceptable letter of 
credit to cover the amount of farmers stock peanuts that is to be 
transferred.
    (b) Contract transfer and transfer of delivery obligations to other 
producers. If a producer is unable to fully perform the terms of a 
contract with a handler for the purchase of additional peanuts due to 
conditions beyond the producer's control or other conditions as may be 
prescribed by CCC, the handler and the producer or the producer's 
successor-in-interest may agree to a modification of the contract or to 
the substitution of another producer either under the original terms of 
the contract or under modified terms that do not change the original 
contract price and quantity. Conditions considered to be beyond the 
producer's control may include, but are not limited to, farm 
reconstitution in some cases (combinations and divisions), insolvency, 
bankruptcy, or death but do not include failure to produce the 
contracted amount from the planted acreage of peanuts due to natural 
disaster or related conditions or failure to plant sufficient acreage to 
produce the contracted quantity. Such modifications or transfers of 
contract obligations shall not be valid without the prior written 
approval of the Deputy Administrator. A transfer shall be approved only 
if the Deputy Administrator determines that such modifications or such 
transfer will not impair the effective operation of the peanut program.
    (c) County committee approval. Contract modifications other than 
changes in producer, owner or operator, or changes permitted by this 
section, may not be approved by the county committee.

export credit will be transferred to the person to whom the credit was 
assigned.
    (e) Transfer of credit for crushing. Disposition credit earned for 
peanuts crushed in accordance with the provisions of this part and under 
the supervision of the marketing association may be assigned to another 
person if a disclaimer to the credit for crushing is submitted with the 
applicable form FV-184-9.

Sec. 1446.408  Decreasing or drawing upon a letter of credit.

    (a) Decreasing the letter of credit to reflect TKC obligation. Any 
existing irrevocable letter of credit that has been presented by a 
handler may be decreased after January 31 of the calendar year following 
the year in which

[[Page 604]]

the peanuts were produced, or such earlier date as may be authorized by 
the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, if the final TKC 
obligation determined for such handler, when converted to a farmers 
stock peanuts basis by dividing the TKC pounds by 0.795 for runner 
peanuts; 0.75 for Spanish peanuts; 0.735 for Virginia peanuts; or 0.77 
for Valencia peanuts, is less than the amount that would be applicable 
for such handler and for such amount of farmers stock peanuts as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 1446.403 of this part. The letter of 
credit may be decreased to the amount so determined.
    (b) Adjusting the letter of credit for acceptable proof of 
disposition. The handler shall deliver to the marketing association 
satisfactory evidence as described in this part, to verify that contract 
additional peanuts have been exported or otherwise disposed of in 
accordance with the provisions of this part. On January 31, of the 
calendar year following the year in which the peanuts were produced, and 
monthly thereafter of such following year, the marketing association 
shall permit a reduction of the letter of credit if the existing letter 
of credit exceeds 140 percent of the national average quota price 
support rate for the applicable crop times the farmers stock equivalent 
of the remaining TKC obligation as determined in the same manner as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Drawing against the letter of credit. (1) If less than 16 days 
remain before the expiration of a handler's letter of credit, and upon 
authorization by CCC, the marketing association may draw against the 
letter of credit and apply the amount toward any penalty due for failure 
to properly dispose of, or account for, contract additional peanuts in 
accordance with this part if:
    (i) By the final disposition date required in this part, a 
deficiency remained in the handler's obligation to crush or export 
contract additional peanuts;
    (ii) By the date required in this part, the handler did not provide 
satisfactory documentary evidence of the full export of peanuts or 
peanut products; or
    (iii) The handler has committed another violation of this part with 
respect to such peanuts.
    (2) Any draw down against a letter of credit shall not compromise 
any penalty due CCC if the letter of credit is insufficient to cover the 
full amount of the penalty or prevent any re-determination of whether 
there has been a proper disposition of and/or accounting for peanuts.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.409  Access to facilities.

    A handler, by entering into contracts to receive contract additional 
peanuts, or any person or firm otherwise receiving contract additional 
peanuts, shall be considered to have agreed that any authorized 
representative of CCC or the marketing association:
    (a) May enter and remain upon any of the premises of the handler 
when such peanuts are being received, shelled, cleaned, bagged, sealed, 
weighed, graded, stored, milled, blanched, crushed, packaged, shipped, 
sized, processed into products, or otherwise handled;
    (b) May inspect such peanuts and the oil, meal, and other products 
thereof; and
    (c) May inspect the premises, facilities, operations, books, and 
records of the handler to the extent necessary to determine that such 
peanuts have been handled in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.410  Disposition date.

    (a) Final disposition date. To avoid a penalty as provided in this 
part, a handler shall dispose of all contract additional peanuts, in 
accordance with the provisions in this part, by the final disposition 
date. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the final 
disposition date shall be October 15 of the year following the calendar 
year in which the crop was grown.
    (b) Extension of final disposition date. The final disposition date 
for an individual handler may be extended by the marketing association 
to November 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the crop 
was grown if, by the final disposition date identified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the handler files a written request with the marketing 
association that specifies

[[Page 605]]

the number of pounds for which an extension is requested.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.411  Export provisions.

    (a) Export to a U.S. Government agency. Except for the exportation 
of raw peanuts to the military exchange services of the United States 
for processing outside the United States, the export of peanuts in any 
form by or to a United States Government agency shall not be considered 
as export to an eligible country, but shall instead be considered a 
domestic edible use of such peanuts. However, sales to a foreign 
government which are financed with funds made available by a United 
States agency, such as the Agency for International Development or CCC, 
will not be considered sales to a United States Government agency if the 
peanuts are not purchased by the foreign buyer for transfer to an agency 
of the United States.
    (b) Export to an eligible country. All contract additional peanuts 
which are not crushed domestically (including approved processing into 
flakes) and which are eligible for export shall be exported in 
accordance with the provisions of this part to an eligible country as 
peanuts or peanut products.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.412  Evidence of export.

    To receive credit toward an obligation to dispose of contract 
additional peanuts in accordance with this part, the handler must:
    (a) Certified statement. Provide a statement signed by the handler 
specifying the name and address of the consignee and certifying that the 
peanuts have been exported.
    (b) Documentation. Not later than 45 days after the final 
disposition date provided in this part, or a later date established by 
the Director, TPD, for cases where the Director finds that the handler 
has made a good faith effort to furnish documentation in a timely manner 
and that the failure to do so was due to conditions beyond the control 
of the handler, furnish to the marketing association or CCC the 
following documentary evidence of the export of peanuts or peanut 
products:
    (1) Export by water. For peanuts or peanut products and peanut 
products that were exported by water, a nonnegotiable original or

    (vi) The country of destination; and
    (vii) For peanut meal which is unsuitable for use as feed because of 
contamination by aflatoxin, the statement required on the bill of lading 
in accordance with this part.
    (2) Export by rail or truck. For peanuts and peanut products that 
were exported by rail or truck:
    (i) A copy of the bill of lading that must include the weight of the

Sec. 1446.413  Disposal of meal contaminated by aflatoxin.

    All meal produced from peanuts which are crushed domestically and 
found to be unsuitable for use as feed because of contamination by 
aflatoxin shall be disposed of for non-feed purposes only. If the meal 
is exported, the export bill of lading shall reflect the analysis of the 
lot by inclusion and appropriate completion thereon the following 
statement showing the range and average aflatoxin content (where ``----
--'' represents the determined values for such lot) as parts per billion 
(PPB):

Sec. 1446.414  Processing additional peanuts into products.

    (a) Type of supervision. A person, who plans to acquire additional 
peanuts from other handlers for processing into products for export, 
must register as a handler and choose a method of supervision in 
accordance with this section.
    (b) Physical supervision. For purposes of this section, if physical 
supervision is chosen:
    (1) Such supervision shall be conducted in accordance with 
provisions of this part; and
    (2) The processor must provide a letter of credit to the marketing 
association as prescribed by this part which shall, to the extent 
practicable, be the same amount as the letter of credit that would be 
required in accordance with this part for an equal quantity of peanuts 
acquired by a handler who has entered into contracts for the purchase of 
additional peanuts and has chosen physical supervision.
    (c) Nonphysical supervision. For purposes of this section, if 
nonphysical supervision is chosen:
    (1) The processor shall:
    (i) Provide a written agreement that is signed by a duly authorized 
person, in which the processor agrees to export additional peanuts to an 
eligible country in such quantities and in accordance with such 
procedures as are specified by this part;
    (ii) Provide a letter of credit to the marketing association which 
shall, to the extent practicable, be the same amount as the letter of 
credit that would be required in accordance with this part for an equal 
quantity of peanuts acquired by a handler who has entered into contracts 
for the purchase of additional peanuts and has chosen nonphysical 
supervision; and
    (iii) Provide to the marketing association a description of the type 
of product that will be processed, the type of containers, size of 
containers, and the standard peanut processing yield for the product.
    (2) The processor shall submit proof of export to the marketing 
association of like kind, as determined by the marketing association, as 
that required by this part for exports of peanuts under nonphysical 
supervision.
    (3) Upon verification of product yield by the marketing association, 
approval of the form CCC-1006, and approval of the letter of credit, a 
product export obligation will be established on marketing association 
ledgers and the processor will be notified of the quantity of product 
export obligation.
    (4) Upon receipt of proof of export that is acceptable to the 
marketing association, the processor, with the concurrence of the 
marketing association, may reduce the letter of credit to the extent 
that such letter of credit exceeds the amount determined by the 
marketing association, in accordance with instructions issued by FSA, to 
be necessary to assure compliance by the processor with the provisions 
in this part.
    (d) Applicability of regulations. By registering as a handler and 
selecting a method of supervision in accordance with this section, a 
processor of peanuts shall be considered to have agreed:
    (1) To perform in accordance with the provisions of this part;
    (2) That the provisions of this part such as access to facilities, 
fraud, liens against peanuts on which penalty is due, and any other 
provisions that apply to a handler of additional peanuts, shall apply to 
the processor; and
    (3) That the processor shall be considered as a handler for purposes 
of applying the penalty provisions of this part.

[[Page 607]]

    (e) Records. A peanut processor shall maintain records that will 
enable the marketing association or other representative of the 
Secretary to determine compliance with the provisions of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.415  Prohibition on importation or reentry of contract additional 
peanuts.

    Neither exported contract additional peanuts nor peanut products 
made from additional peanuts shall be imported or reentered in 
commercial quantities by anyone into the United States in any form. If 
contract additional peanuts or peanut products made from such peanuts 
are imported or reentered into the United States, the handler importing 
such peanuts or peanut products shall be liable for a penalty assessed 
in accordance with this part, for reentering contract additional 
peanuts.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.416  Suspension of restrictions on imported peanuts.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if the President 
issues a proclamation under Section 404(b) of the Uruguay Round 
Agreements Act (19 USCS Sec. 3601(b)) expanding the quantity of peanuts 
subject to the in-quota rate of duty under a tariff-rate quota, or under 
section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustments Act (7 U.S.C. 624), reenacted 
with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 
temporarily suspending restrictions on the importation of peanuts, a 
handler, with the written consent of the producer and CCC, may purchase 
additional peanuts from any producer who, in accordance with this part, 
contracted with the handler to deliver additional peanuts to such 
handler and may use such peanuts for sale for domestic edible use 
without incurring any marketing penalty for failure to crush or export 
such peanuts. However, the maximum quantity of peanuts that may be 
purchased by such handler in accordance with this provision of this 
section is the quantity of contract additional peanuts that remains 
undelivered by such producer under the contract. For purposes of 
application of this section, a proclamation temporarily increasing the 
import quota shall not be considered the same as a temporary suspension 
of restrictions on the importation of peanuts.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.417  Loss of peanuts.

    Should a handler suffer a loss of peanuts as a result of fire, flood 
or any other condition beyond the control of the handler, the portion of 
such loss that may be attributed to contract additional peanuts, as 
determined by the marketing association shall not be greater than an 
amount determined by dividing the total of the contract additional 
peanuts acquired by the handler during the year by such handler's total 
peanut purchases for the year and multiplying the result by the quantity 
for which acceptable proof of loss has been furnished to the marketing 
association. Such attribution shall take into account any dispositions 
of peanuts that occurred prior to the loss of the peanuts for which the 
attribution is made.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.501  Accounting for contract additional peanuts acquired under 
physical supervision.

    (a) Commingled storage--(1) General. For a handler operating under 
physical supervision, contract additional peanuts placed in commingled 
storage must be accounted for on a dollar value basis less a one time 
adjustment for shrinkage for each crop.
    (2) Shrinkage. For peanuts that are graded out and accounted for:
    (i) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.
    (ii) After January 31 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.5 percent for all other peanuts.
    (3) Records. The handler shall maintain a copy of each form FSA-1007 
that

[[Page 608]]

was issued for any peanuts that are placed in commingled storage and 
that is issued for any peanuts removed from storage.
    (b) Supervised identity preserved storage. For a handler operating 
under physical supervision, contract additional peanuts may be stored 
identity preserved and may be accounted for by disposing of the entire 
contents of the peanuts in each identity preserved warehouse in 
accordance with this part and under the supervision of a representative 
of the marketing association. In such case:
    (1) All peanuts that are loaded into each warehouse must be 
inspected as farmers stock peanuts and must be loaded under the 
supervision of the marketing association.
    (2) At the end of each day in which peanuts are placed in or removed 
from the warehouse, the warehouse must be sealed by a representative of 
the marketing association.
    (3) Each warehouse seal may be removed only by a representative of 
the marketing association.
    (4) The marketing association shall be reimbursed by the handler for 
all expenses of providing a representative to supervise the loading and 
unloading of each warehouse.
    (c) Nonsupervised identity preserved storage--(1) Conditions. For a 
handler operating under physical supervision, contract additional 
peanuts may be stored identity preserved without supervision at the time 
of loading the peanuts into each warehouse, but only if:
    (i) All peanuts that are loaded into a warehouse are inspected prior 
to loading into such warehouse and a form FSA-1007 prepared for each lot 
that is inspected;
    (ii) The entire contents of each warehouse will be removed and 
disposed of in accordance with this part and under supervision of a 
representative of the marketing association; and
    (iii) The peanuts are accounted for on a dollar value basis except 
that shrinkage, in the amounts provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, will be allowed if the dollar value of the peanuts that are 
loaded out of each warehouse is less than the dollar value of the 
peanuts that were loaded into such warehouse.
    (2) Shrinkage. For peanuts that are graded out and accounted for:
    (i) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.

adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.5 percent for all other peanuts.
    (3) Records. The handler shall maintain a copy of each form FSA-1007 
that is issued for any peanuts that are placed in nonsupervised identity 
preserved storage and that is issued for any peanuts that are removed 
from such storage.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.502  Physical supervision of contract additional peanuts.

    (a) Supervision. A handler who has chosen to operate under physical 
supervision shall make arrangements that are satisfactory to the 
marketing association for representatives of the marketing association 
to conduct onsite supervision of domestic handling of contract 
additional peanuts including storing, shelling, crushing, cleaning, 
milling, blanching, weighing, and shipping.
    (b) Final dates for scheduling supervision. Contract additional 
farmers stock peanuts shall be scheduled for supervision by the 
marketing association during the normal marketing period but not later 
than August 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the crop 
was grown, unless prior approval of a later date has been made by the 
marketing association.
    (c) Notifying the marketing association. Before moving or processing 
any contract additional peanuts, the handler or an agent of the handler 
shall notify the marketing association of the time such operation will 
begin and the approximate period of time required to complete the 
operation. When a plant is not currently under supervision, the handler 
shall give at least five working

[[Page 609]]

days of advance notice to the marketing association so that supervision 
can be arranged.
    (d) Processing. The identical peanuts identified at time of load-out 
as contract additional peanuts shall be shelled or otherwise milled, 
crushed, or shelled and crushed under supervision of the marketing 
association as a continuous operation separate from other peanuts. 
Shelled peanuts shall be identified with positive lot identity tags 
before being stored and moved for crushing, exportation, or processing 
into peanut products to be exported. Except as otherwise authorized by 
the marketing association, such peanuts will be considered as having 
been crushed or exported only if positive lot identity has been 
maintained in the following manner:
    (1) Transportation. The peanuts shall be transported from storage 
locations in a covered vehicle such as a truck or railroad car. The 
vehicle shall be sealed unless the marketing association determines that 
identity of the peanuts can be maintained without sealing.
    (2) Storage. Farmers stock peanuts shall be stored in a separate 
building(s) or bin(s) which can be sealed or which the marketing 
association otherwise determines will satisfactorily maintain lot 
identity. Milled peanuts shall be stored in such a manner that the 
marketing association, under procedures issued by CCC, may make periodic 
inventory verification of the contract additional lots that are shown on 
marketing association records as being in the storage facility. The 
handler shall furnish to the marketing association the name and location 
of the storage facilities in which the contract additional peanuts are 
located.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.503  Disposition requirements under physical supervision.

    (a) Methods of disposition. Except under the provisions of Sec. 
1446.504 of this part applicable to substitution, the identical contract 
additional farmers stock peanuts and milled peanuts that are shelled 
under supervision of the marketing association and formed into lots 
shall be disposed of, in accordance with the provisions of this part 
that are applicable to contract additional peanuts and to physical 
supervision, by domestic crushing or by export to an eligible country as 
follows:
    (1) All kernels may be crushed domestically under supervision of the 
marketing association representative; or
    (2) All kernels may be exported for crushing, if fragmented; or
    (3) All kernels that meet the standards established for the domestic 
market under the Marketing Agreement No.146 may be exported and the 
remaining kernels crushed domestically under supervision of the 
marketing association representative; or
    (4) All of the peanuts may be exported as farmers stock peanuts, 
provided that such peanuts meet the standards established for the 
domestic market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146 and are positive 
lot identified; or
    (5) The peanuts may be exported to an eligible country as peanut 
products if such products are produced domestically; or
    (6) The peanuts may be exported as milled or in-shell peanuts if 
they meet the edible export standards established for the domestic 
market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146; or
    (7) The peanuts may be considered exported or crushed if it is 
determined by CCC that such peanuts have been destroyed or otherwise 
made unsuitable for any commercial purpose.
    (b) Peanuts diverted. Contract additional peanuts, or peanut 
products made from contract additional peanuts, that are diverted to any 
country other than an eligible country shall not be credited in the 
handler's favor against the handler's obligation to crush or export such 
peanuts.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.504  Substitution of quota and additional peanuts.

    (a) Substitution of quota peanuts which have been exported--(1) 
Farmers stock peanuts. With prior notification to and approval of the 
marketing association, farmers stock quota peanuts that have been 
exported from the same crop, type, quality, and area may be substituted 
for additional peanuts that otherwise would have to be exported in

[[Page 610]]

accordance with this part to avoid a penalty.
    (2) Milled peanuts. With prior notification to and approval by the 
marketing association, peanuts that are milled under supervision of the 
marketing association may be used to replace, in domestic edible use, 
quota peanuts that have been exported to an eligible country from the 
same crop, type, area, and of the same grade as recognized by the Peanut 
Administrative Committee (PAC) for edible quality grades. Such grades 
shall be established at the time the peanuts are milled and the lot is 
formed unless CCC directs otherwise in writing. The quota peanuts that 
are exported, for which substitution is requested, must have been 
positive lot identified and otherwise handled as additional peanuts 
under the supervision of the marketing association.
    (b) Use of additional peanuts for domestic edible uses prior to 
substitution--(1) General requirements. Additional peanuts may be used 
for domestic edible use with prior notification and approval of the 
marketing association and upon presentation to the marketing association 
of an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount that is determined in 
the same manner as such handler's initial letter of credit for the 
quantity of peanuts that will be substituted. Such letter of credit is 
in addition to the letter of credit required in accordance this part as 
a condition for approval of contracts for additional peanuts. Such 
additional letter of credit for substitution shall be issued in a form 
and by a bank which is acceptable to CCC.
    (2) Submitting evidence of export. The handler subsequently shall 
dispose of a like amount of quota peanuts in the manner prescribed in 
this part for contract additional peanuts. If the quota peanuts are 
exported, the handler shall subsequently deliver to the marketing 
association satisfactory evidence that a like amount of quota peanuts of 
the same type and of a similar grade has been exported. Such evidence 
must be submitted no later than the earlier of:
    (i) 30 days after the final date for export as established in 
accordance with this part; or
    (ii) 15 days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit.
    (3) Failure to timely submit evidence of export. If satisfactory 
evidence is not presented by such date determined in (b)(2) of this 
section, CCC may authorize the marketing association to draw against the 
letter of credit for the full amount of the penalty which would 
otherwise be due for failure to dispose of contract additional peanuts 
in accordance with this part.

 Subpart F_Handling Contract Additional Peanuts_Nonphysical Supervision


<R05>
Sec. 1446.601  Disposition requirements under nonphysical supervision.

    (a) Disposition requirement. With respect to any marketing year, a 
handler who has selected nonphysical supervision shall account for the 
disposition of any contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler 
by providing evidence that is satisfactory to the marketing association 
of the quantity of peanuts by peanut type that are crushed or exported 
by such handler in each of the following kernel categories:
    (1) SS kernels;
    (2) SMK's; and
    (3) AO kernels.
    (b) SS kernels. (1) For each lot of contract additional peanuts 
acquired by such handler for which a deduction would have been 
applicable for SS kernels under the applicable price support loan 
schedule, deduct, from the percentage of SS kernels in such lot of 
peanuts, a number of percentage points equal to the maximum percentage 
of SS kernels that a lot of peanuts could contain without having a 
deduction for SS kernels under the applicable price support loan 
schedule and multiply the result by the total weight of the TKC content 
of the lot, excluding the weight of the LSK's in such lot.
    (2) Determine separately, for each type of peanuts acquired by such 
handler, the total of the results obtained in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section for all lots of contract additional peanuts acquired by such 
handler.
    (3) For each type of peanuts acquired by such handler, multiply the 
result determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by 0.955 in order 
to provide an

[[Page 611]]

allowance for shrinkage. The result is the minimum quantity of SS 
kernels of peanuts of the respective type that shall be crushed or 
exported by such handler.
    (c) SMK and SS kernels. (1) Determine, by type, the total of the 
quantity of SMK and SS kernels in the lots of contract additional 
peanuts acquired during the marketing year by such handler.
    (2) From the total determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
deduct the amount determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (3) For each type of peanuts acquired by such handler, multiply the 
results obtained in (c)(2) of this section by 0.955. The result is the 
minimum combined quantity of SMK's and SS kernels (excluding the 
quantity of SS kernels required to be crushed or exported as determined 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) of the respective type that shall 
be exported or crushed by such handler.
    (d) AO kernels. (1) Determine, by type, the total quantity of TKC in 
the lots of contract additional peanuts acquired during the marketing 
year by such handler.
    (2) From the total determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
deduct:
    (i) The amount of SS kernels determining in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The combined SMK's and SS kernels determined in paragraph

Sec. 1446.602  Disposition credit for peanuts under nonphysical 
supervision.

    (a) Disposition credits. Contract additional peanuts of the same 
crop year and of like type shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
provisions of this part. Disposition shall be by domestic crushing or by 
export to an eligible country. Disposition credit shall, subject to the 
provisions of this part, be granted for:
    (1) Kernels that are crushed domestically under physical supervision 
of the marketing association representative; or
    (2) Kernels that are exported for crushing, if fragmented before 
being exported; or
    (3) Exported kernels that meet PAC outgoing quality standards for 
domestic edible use; or
    (4) Peanuts that are exported as farmers stock peanuts, provided 
that such peanuts meet PAC incoming quality standards for Segregation 1 
peanuts and are positive lot identified; or
    (5) Peanuts that are exported to an eligible country as peanut 
products if such products are produced domestically in accordance with 
provisions of this part; or
    (6) Peanuts that are exported as milled or in-shell peanuts if they 
meet PAC outgoing quality standards for domestic edible peanuts; or
    (7) Peanuts that are exported as blanched peanuts; or
    (8) Peanuts that are determined by the marketing association as 
having been destroyed or otherwise made unsuitable for any commercial 
purpose. In such case the peanuts shall be considered as crushed.

[[Page 612]]

    (b) Requesting physical supervision of crushing for disposition 
credit. Prior to the disposition date for contract additional peanuts, 
as provided in this part, a handler operating under the provisions of 
this part with respect to nonphysical supervision may request and 
arrange for the marketing association to supervise the crushing of SMK, 
SS and AO peanuts for disposition credit for the applicable kernel type 
by obtaining physical supervision of the peanuts under the following 
conditions:
    (1) Milled peanuts. A request to change to physical supervision for 
crushing milled peanuts for SMK, SS or AO credit may be made at any time 
prior to the final disposition date for additional peanuts for the 
relevant crop year. Physical supervision of milled peanuts shall be 
provided under the provisions of this part applicable to physical 
supervision of milled peanuts. The marketing association may require 
that positive identified lots be regraded before crushing.
    (2) Farmers stock peanuts. A request to change to physical 
supervision for crushing farmers stock peanuts must be made and approved 
prior to the peanuts being graded out of commingled storage. In order to 
determine the categories, by peanut type, for the kernels that are 
crushed, namely SS, SMK and AO kernels, physical supervision must begin 
at the gradeout from commingled storage and continue through the 
crushing of the peanuts as required in accordance with this part for a 
handler who chooses physical supervision for disposition of contract 
additional farmers stock peanuts.
    (c) Determining disposition credit. Disposition credit for SMK, SS 
and AO kernels crushed under physical supervision shall be determined 
for farmers stock peanuts from the applicable form FSA-1007, and for 
milled peanuts from the applicable form FV-184-9.
    (d) Application of crushing credits to disposition obligation--(1) 
Milled peanuts. Milled peanuts that are crushed under physical 
supervision for disposition credit may receive credit as follows:
    (i) If such peanuts meet PAC outgoing quality standards for domestic 
edible peanuts, disposition credit may apply pound-for-pound toward 
meeting the respective SMK, SS, or AO kernel obligations for the 
respective like peanut type and for like kernel type.
    (ii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC outgoing quality standards for 
domestic edible use due to aflatoxin contamination, disposition credit 
may apply to the SMK, SS or AO kernel obligations for the respective 
like peanut type and for like kernel type; except that, the percentage 
of such peanuts to which such credit will be allowed for each peanut 
type and kernel type shall not exceed the percentage of the total 
quantity of the respective type of peanuts that was purchased by the 
handler for the marketing year as contract additional peanuts.
    (iii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC outgoing quality standards 
for reasons other than aflatoxin contamination, disposition credit must 
be applied exclusively as AO kernels.
    (2) Farmers stock peanuts. Farmers stock peanuts that are crushed 
under physical supervision for disposition credit may receive credit as 
follows:
    (i) If such peanuts meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts, disposition credit may apply pound-for-pound 
toward meeting the respective SMK, SS, or AO kernel obligations for the 
respective like peanut type and for like kernel type.
    (ii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts, disposition credit may apply to the SMK, SS or AO 
kernel obligations for the respective like peanut type and for like 
kernel type; except that, the percentage of such peanuts to which such 
credit will be allowed for each peanut type and kernel type shall not 
exceed the percentage of the total quantity of the respective type of 
peanuts that was purchased by the handler for the marketing year as 
contract additional peanuts.
    (iii) If such peanuts do not meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts for any reason other than the presence of A. 
flavus mold, disposition credit must be applied exclusively as AO 
kernels.
    (3) Adjusting export credit for average dollar value of farmers 
stock peanuts. If CCC determines that the average dollar value of edible 
farmers stock peanuts graded out of commingled storage and

[[Page 613]]

crushed for export credit under the provisions of this section is less 
than the average dollar value of all like type peanuts purchased by the 
handler as contract additional peanuts, the amount of export credit for 
each kernel type determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall 
be adjusted by multiplying each quantity for each kernel type by a 
factor to be determined by dividing:
    (i) The average dollar value per ton of peanuts graded out of the 
handler's commingled storage, accounted for as set forth in this part, 
and crushed for export credit under the provisions of this section; by
    (ii) The average dollar value per ton of all peanuts purchased by 
the handler as contract additional peanuts.
    (e) Blanching exception. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
part, a handler may receive credit for the pre-blanching weight of SS 
and SMK peanuts that are blanched for export if both the blanching and 
the crushing of the residue are conducted under supervision of agents of 
CCC or the marketing association. The maximum credit that may be 
received shall be:
    (1) The quantity of SMK and SS kernels as shown on the FV-184-9 that 
is submitted for proof of export for such blanched peanuts;
    (2) The quantity of the residue that is crushed under physical 
supervision; and
    (3) The pre-blanched or ``redskin'' weight less the quantities in 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, to the extent of such amount 
that the marketing association determines is reasonable and comparable 
with standard industry practices.
    (f) Export credits. In order to receive export credit toward meeting 
a handler's obligation to crush or export additional peanuts such 
exported peanuts must meet the outgoing quality standard established for 
the domestic market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146. Export credit 
will be granted in accordance with this paragraph for any exported 
peanuts that meet such quality standards.
    (1) Credit for exporting SMK peanuts. Credit for exporting SMK's of 
the same crop year, of like type, may be earned for:
    (i) The total pounds in a lot of exported peanuts which meet or 
exceed U.S. Standard grade for U.S. No. 1; or
    (ii) The total pounds, excluding splits as determined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii) of this section, in a lot of peanuts which meet PAC standards 
for:
    (A) Whole kernel peanuts with splits, or
    (B) No. 2 Virginia peanuts; or
    (iii) The total pounds determined to be SMK's in a lot of exported 
in-shell peanuts which meet U.S. Standard grade for cleaned Virginia 
type peanuts in the shell.
    (2) Credit for exporting SS kernels. Credits for SS kernels of the 
same crop year, of like type, may be earned for:
    (i) The total pounds in a lot of exported peanuts which meet the 
U.S. Standard grade for splits; or
    (ii) The total pounds, excluding SMK's as determined in paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii) of this section, in a lot of peanuts which meets PAC 
standards for:
    (A) Whole kernel with splits, or
    (B) No. 2 Virginia; or
    (iii) The total pounds determined to be SS kernels in a lot of 
exported in-shell peanuts which meet U.S. Standard grade for cleaned 
Virginia type peanuts in the shell.
    (3) Export credits for contract additional peanuts processed into 
products for export. To receive disposition credit for contract 
additional peanuts used in products for export, the shelled peanuts must 
be identified with positive lot identity tags before being moved for 
processing in accordance with provisions of this part. The peanuts shall 
be processed under supervision of the marketing association unless the 
processing handler selects to process such peanuts under nonphysical 
supervision.
    (4) Export credits for in-shell peanuts. With respect to peanuts 
exported in-shell, in accordance with instructions issued by CCC, 
credits may be earned for SMK, SS or AO kernels on the respective 
portions of the TKC of the lot that are SMK, SS or AO kernels.

               Subpart G_Penalties and Liquidated Damages


<R05>
Sec. 1446.701  Excess marketing of quota peanuts.

    A handler will be subject to a penalty for noncompliance with this 
part, if, as determined under this part, from any crop of peanuts, such 
handler markets, for domestic edible use, a larger quantity, or higher 
grade or quality of peanuts, than could reasonably be produced from the 
quantity of peanuts having the grade, kernel content, and quality of 
farmers stock peanuts purchased by the handler during the applicable 
marketing year as quota peanuts, including those peanuts purchased in 
accordance with the ``immediate buyback'' provisions of this part. In

[[Page 615]]

such case, the penalty will be an amount equal to 140 percent of the 
national average quota support rate for the applicable crop, times that 
quantity of farmers stock peanuts which are determined by CCC to be 
necessary to produce the excess quantity or grade or quality of peanuts 
marketed.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.702  Peanuts ineligible for quota loan.

    Any person who causes or permits peanuts that are not eligible 
peanuts to be pledged as collateral for a loan at the quota loan rate 
shall be considered to have agreed that:
    (a) CCC may incur serious and substantial damage to its program to 
support the price of quota peanuts because such peanuts were pledged as 
collateral for a quota loan;
    (b) The amount of such damages will be difficult, if not impossible, 
to ascertain exactly; and
    (c) Such person shall, with respect to any ineligible peanuts placed 
under quota loan, pay to CCC, as liquidated damages and in addition to 
any penalty that is due, the difference between the quota loan rate for 
such peanuts and the additional loan rate that would apply to peanuts of 
the same type and quality, times the amount of such peanuts that were 
placed under loan. It is agreed that such liquidated damages are a 
reasonable estimate of the probable actual damages which CCC would 
suffer. Such person shall pay the damages to CCC promptly upon demand in 
addition to penalties as may be due or assessed. Liquidated damages 
under this section may be reduced by CCC based upon consideration of the 
following factors:
    (1) Whether the person causing or permitting ineligible peanuts to 
be placed in the loan program made a good faith effort to ensure that 
ineligible peanuts were not pledged as loan collateral;
    (2) The degree of damage or potential damage to the price support 
program caused by the violation;
    (3) The nature and circumstances of the violation;
    (4) The extent of the violation; and

<R05>
Sec. 1464.1  Administration.

    (a) This program will be administered by the Tobacco Division, FSA, 
under the general direction and supervision of the Executive Vice 
President, CCC. The program will be carried out by cooperative marketing 
associations (hereinafter referred to as ``associations'') acting on 
behalf of their producer members. To obtain a price support loan, an 
association must enter into a loan agreement with CCC. The loan 
agreement will set forth terms and conditions for making price support 
available to producers. To the extent provided in the loan agreement, an 
association shall meet the eligibility requirements for price support 
prescribed in the Cooperative Marketing Associations Eligibility 
Requirements for Price Support (part 1425 of this chapter), as amended. 
CCC reserves the right to restrict the number of associations with which 
it will contract. In so doing, CCC will select such associations as it 
deems necessary or desirable to effectuate the purposes of the program 
with a maximum of efficiency and economy of operations. The names of 
such associations may be obtained from the Tobacco Division, FSA, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013.
    (b) Each year CCC will make loans to associations. The associations 
in turn will make price support advances available to eligible producers 
either directly or through auction warehouses. The tobacco on which 
producers receive price support advances will serve as security for the 
loans. Loans made to associations will include not only the initial loan 
value of the tobacco, but also amounts to cover costs of receiving, 
processing, storing, and selling the loan tobacco, including that part 
of overhead costs not borne by the association pursuant to Sec. 1464.4. 
Associations will be authorized to enter into contracts for these 
services through the usual trade channels. Loans also may include 
amounts to cover any Federal and State income taxes which the 
associations are required by the Internal Revenue Service or State 
governmental body to pay on income received from the sale of loan 
tobacco.

FR 21110, May 11, 1983; 68 FR 65385, Nov. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.2  Availability of price support.

    (a) Kind of tobacco. Price support will be available to eligible 
producers on the following kinds of eligible tobacco subject to 
conditions listed in Sec. Sec. 1464.7 and 1464.8 respectively.

Flue-cured tobacco, types 11, 12, 13, and 14.
Kentucky-Tennessee Fire-cured tobacco, types 22 and 23.
Virginia Fire-cured tobacco, type 21.
Virginia Sun-cured tobacco, type 37.
Dark Air-Cured tobacco, types 35 and 36.
Burley tobacco, type 31.
Cigar filler and binder tobacco, types 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, and 55.

    (b) Method of providing price support--(1) Through auction 
warehouses. (i) Price support will be available for each lot of eligible 
tobacco offered for sale at auction warehouses which have contracted 
with an association, on a form of agreement approved by CCC, to make 
price support advances to producers on behalf of the association. 
Producers will deliver their tobacco to auction warehouses which will 
display the tobacco and offer it for sale at auction. Each contract 
between an association and an auction warehouse will require the auction 
warehouse to see that producers are informed that price support advances 
are available for each lot of eligible tobacco offered for sale at 
auction when the final bid is less than the price support rate available 
for the grade of eligible tobacco comprising such lot. For Flue-cured 
and Burley tobacco, the associations' contracts with auction warehouses 
will also require the auction warehouses to mark any tobacco sale bill 
``No Price Support'' if the marketing of the pounds of tobacco covered 
by such bill will result in the producer marketing in excess of 103 
percent of the producer's effective farm marketing quota. Producers will 
receive price support advances from the warehouse operator for any 
tobacco to be consigned by the warehouse operator to the association. 
Price support advances will be paid to the producer at the time the 
warehouse operator settles with the producer for the entire

[[Page 622]]

quantity of the producer's tobacco that has been displayed for 
inspection and offered for sale on any one day's auction market. The 
warehouse operator will be reimbursed by the association with funds 
borrowed from CCC.
    (ii) Price support will be available only at warehouses where 
tobacco inspection service is provided by the Agricultural Marketing 
Service, USDA. Inspection and price support services may be extended to 
new markets or to additional sales on established markets in accordance 
with this part and Subpart A of part 29 of this title which provides for 
formal public hearings prior to extending of additional services.
    (iii) CCC reserves the right to direct the association to withhold a 
contract under the price support program from any auction warehouse for 
one or more years if, based on previous performance of similar 
contracts, or other evidence, there is substantial reason to believe 
that such warehouse will not fulfill its contract obligations.
    (2) Upon direct delivery to the Association. Eligible producers in 
nonauction market areas may deliver eligible tobacco to central 
receiving points designated by the appropriate association.
    (3) Period of price support. Price support will be available to 
eligible producers on eligible tobacco only during each year's normal 
marketing season for each kind of tobacco for which support is provided.
    (4) Beginning with the 1981 crop, eligible producers may obtain 
price support on untied burley tobacco packed in bales subject to the 
following conditions:
    (i) The quality and condition of the tobacco contained in each bale 
delivered for price support as a single lot will be representative of 
the quality and condition of the tobacco contained in all other such 
bales of the same lot.
    (ii) The tobacco in each bale will be stalk-cured.
    (iii) The bales will not contain foreign matter or conceal inferior 
tobacco.
    (iv) Specification of bales:
    (A) Bales must be approximately 1x2x3 feet in size.
    (B) The leaves in bales must be untied and oriented.
    (C) The basket ticket shall show the number of bales in the lot. 
Each bale in the lot shall be identified by a uniform identification tag 
1\5/8\ inches wide by 3\1/4\ inches long which shall be attached 
securely to the bale and shall show at least the following information: 
(1) Warehouse registration number, (2) basket ticket identification 
number, and (3) bale number.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.3  Level of price support.

    (a) The level of price support for eligible tobacco shall be 
determined in accordance with section 106 of the Agricultural Act of 
1949, as amended.
    (b) Flue-Cured tobacco of varieties Coker 139, Coker 140, Coker 316, 
Reams 64, Reams 266, and Dixie Bright 244, or a mixture or strain of 
such seed varieties or any breeding line of Flue-Cured tobacco seed 
varieties, including, but not limited to, 187 Golden Wilt (also 
designated by such names as No-Name, XYZ), having the quality and 
chemical characteristics of the seed varieties designated as Coker 139, 
Coker 140, Coker 316, Reams 64, Reams 266, or Dixie Bright 244 will be 
supported at one-half the support rate, plus 50 cents per hundred 
pounds, for comparable grades of acceptable varieties.

[51 FR 32426, Sept. 12, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.4  Deductions from advances.

    (a) There may be deducted from price support advances paid to 
tobacco producers amounts to help defray administrative overhead costs 
incurred by producers associations through which price support is made 
available to tobacco producers.
    (b) If any producer on a farm is indebted to the United States and 
such indebtedness is listed on the Claim Control Record, the Government 
will effect collection of the amount of the indebtedness by setoff from 
the amount of price support advance due the producer in the following 
manner: Any

[[Page 623]]

marketing card covering tobacco eligible for price support issued for 
such farm in accordance with the applicable regulations issued by the 
Secretary of Agriculture with respect to marketing quotas (parts 723 of 
this title) will bear a notation showing the indebtedness, the name of 
the debtor and the amount of the indebtedness. The acceptance and use of 
a marketing card bearing a notation of indebtedness to the United States 
by a producer named as debtor on such card will constitute an 
authorization by such producer to any tobacco warehouse operator or 
association to pay the United States the price support advance due the 
producer to the extent of their indebtedness set forth on such card but 
not to exceed that portion of the price support advance remaining after 
deduction of usual warehouse and authorized price support charges and 
amounts due prior lienholders. The acceptance and use of a marketing 
card bearing a notation and information of indebtedness to the United 
States will not constitute a waiver of any right of the producer to 
contest the validity of such indebtedness by appropriate administrative 
appeal or legal action.

[45 FR 9253, Feb. 12, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 28608, July 1, 1982; 56 
FR 21259, May 8, 1991; 68 FR 65386, Nov. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.5  Interest rate and general provisions.

    The loans made to the associations will bear interest at the rate 
announced by CCC and will be nonrecourse both as to principal and 
interest except in the case of misrepresentation, fraud or failure to 
carry out the loan agreement. Tobacco loses its identity as to original 
ownership through commingling in the packing process, and individual 
producers may not redeem their tobacco once it has been pledged as 
security for the loan. Associations will sell the loan tobacco as 
provided in the loan agreements for each crop, and the net proceeds of 
sales of the loan collateral of each crop will be applied to the loan 
account for such crop until the loan is repaid in full. With respect to 
the 1981 and prior crops, if the proceeds from the sale of loan 
collateral of the 1981 or any prior crop exceed (a) the amount of the 
loan plus all fees, handling charges, operating costs and interest; and 
(b) any amount due CCC under a barter transfer agreement entered into 
between CCC and the association, such excess shall constitute ``net 
gains'' and shall be distributed in cash by the association to the 
producers who placed the tobacco under loan unless other disposition is 
approved by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.6  Maturity date.

    Loans made under the program will mature on demand.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.7  Eligible producer.

    To qualify as an eligible producer for purposes of receiving price 
support during the current marketing year a person must have eligible 
tobacco, as provided in Sec. 1464.8, for marketing and such person:
    (a) Must have agreed to make contributions to a No Net Cost Fund or 
pay assessments to a No Net Cost Account, as applicable, in accordance 
with Sec. 1464.10.
    (b) Must not have been found, after notice and opportunity for an 
administrative hearing in accordance with part 780 of this title, to 
have:
    (1) Knowingly delivered nested tobacco for the purpose of receiving 
price support.
    (2) Filed a false report with respect to the use of pesticides on 
tobacco produced for marketing during the current marketing year.
    (3) Erroneously represented any fact affecting a tobacco program 
determination.
    (4) Adopted any scheme or device which tends to defeat the purpose 
of the tobacco program.
    (5) Made any fraudulent representations with respect to the tobacco 
program.
    (c) Must be in compliance with the provisions of part 12 of this 
title.
    (d) In addition to meeting all other requirements that apply 
elsewhere, including (but not limited to) the warehouse designation 
provisions of Sec. 1464.2, must not be ineligible, in accordance with 
part 1400 of this title, to receive

[[Page 624]]

price support payments, loans and benefits.
    (e) With respect to any tobacco which is presented for price 
support, must have retained beneficial interest in the tobacco prior to 
presenting the tobacco for such loan.
    (1) For purposes of this section, the producer will be considered to 
have retained beneficial interest in the tobacco only if such producer 
has complete control of and title to such tobacco, including the right 
to tender such tobacco to CCC for a price support loan on the date such 
tobacco is tendered to CCC for a price support loan, and has maintained 
this right and that interest in the tobacco at all times prior to 
presenting the tobacco for the loan.
    (2) If a producer receives a monetary advance or other consideration 
in connection with or for such tobacco, the producer will be deemed for 
purposes of this section to have lost beneficial interest in such 
tobacco unless the producer has a written agreement with the person who 
provides the advance payment or consideration and such agreement 
accurately and fully:
    (i) Sets forth the amount, nature and date of the advance or 
consideration;
    (ii) Sets forth the poundage on which the advance or consideration 
was made;
    (iii) Provides that the tobacco will be sold at a producer auction 
through an auction warehouse at which price support is provided, or will 
be presented for a price support loan;
    (iv) Provides that as a full and final settlement on the tobacco, 
the full sales price at the producer auction or the full loan proceeds 
will be paid to the producer minus only the following:
    (A) Any advance set out in the agreement; and
    (B) Standard published assessments or charges for services rendered 
at standard published rates that apply to all tobacco of all producers, 
including tobacco for which no advance has been paid;
    (v) Sets forth the date of final settlement to be made on the 
tobacco which date can be no later than the date applicable to tobacco 
on which no advance has been made.
    (vi) States that the full profit and beneficial interest in the 
tobacco, and full control of the tobacco, remains with the producer and 
provides that the full profit and beneficial interest will remain with 
the producer at all times prior to any disposition of the tobacco as 
producer tobacco, or at a producer auction, or presenting for a price 
support loan.
    (3) A producer will be considered to have lost beneficial interest 
in tobacco and thereby not be an ``eligible producer'' for such tobacco 
as of the date any advance or other preauction arrangement was made if 
CCC determines for that tobacco that:
    (i) The advance per pound equalled or exceeded the producer's final 
net proceeds per pound on all tobacco marketed from the farm for that 
marketing year at producer auctions, including any tobacco on which an 
advance is made or the pledging of tobacco for price support loans;
    (ii) A written agreement was required by paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, but none has been executed; or
    (iii) A written agreement was executed but did not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) If tobacco is pledged for a price support loan and the producer 
is not then or thereafter deemed to be or to have been an eligible 
producer for that tobacco for purposes of placing the tobacco under such 
loan, then the tobacco shall be considered to have a loan value of zero. 
The producer and the person that took possession of the tobacco from the 
producer, or paid an advance, or marketed the tobacco, or disposed of 
the tobacco as producer tobacco, shall be jointly and severally liable 
with the producer for returning any loan proceeds previously paid in the 
name of, or for the account of, the producer. Further, the disposition 
of any tobacco as producer tobacco where the producer is not then or 
thereafter considered to have been an eligible producer with respect to 
such tobacco may be the subject of penalties on the grounds of false 
identification, excess marketings, or otherwise as provided in part 723 
of this title. These remedies

[[Page 625]]

are in addition to any others as may apply.

Sec. 1464.8  Eligible tobacco.

    Eligible tobacco for the purpose of pledging such tobacco as 
collateral for a price support loan is any tobacco of a kind for which

sound and merchantable condition, is not nested as defined in 7 CFR part 
29, and:
    (a) Is not a kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are not in

    (b) Is offered for marketing by the person who was the producer of 
the tobacco, or in the case of a deceased producer, by the duly 
authorized successor(s) in interest;

received by such producer.

Such a penalty only shall be assessed after the person has been notified

the penalty. However, such marketing penalty shall not be assessed if 
such contributions or assessment are collected and remitted not later

located a statement of the reason for the failure of the person to 
timely remit such collection, including the name and address of the 
warehouse involved, the pounds of tobacco purchased, the date of 
purchase, and the date the collection was required to be remitted. The 
association shall submit such facts within 25 days after the applicable 
due date regardless of whether such assessment or contribution has been 
remitted to the association.

[[Page 633]]

importing such tobacco establishes, to the satisfaction of the Director,

Assessment refunds will be based on entry weight as identified on 
Customs Service Form CF7501 or CF7505, or other documentation or data as 
required by the Director or found by the Director to be appropriate. 
Additional refund documentation, including proof of export, will be 
required consistent with the ``duty drawback'' provisions administered 
by the Customs Service pursuant to section 313(a) of the Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended. Persons seeking a refund shall submit their request 
and documentation to the Director, Tobacco Division, Farm Service Agency 
(FSA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), P.O. Box 2415,

shall be to the importer unless the importer, in writing, notifies the 
Director that the payment should be made to the exporter.

    (a) Failure to remit assessments. An importer who fails to timely 
remit an assessment in accordance with this subpart shall be subject to 
a marketing penalty.
    (1) Budget deficit marketing assessment. With respect to the 
assessment referred to in Sec. 1464.102, if an importer fails to pay or 
to timely remit the BDMA, such importer shall be subject to a marketing 
penalty at a per kilogram rate equal to 75 percent of the average market 
price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the respective like 
kind domestic tobacco being imported for the domestic marketing year 
which immediately preceded the domestic marketing year in which the 
imported tobacco became subject to the BDMA. Such marketing penalty rate 
shall apply to the quantity of tobacco on which the failure occurred. 
Amounts due for the penalty shall be in addition to any other amount as 
may be due, including, but not limited to, the amount due for the BDMA 
itself, or any applicable late fees, charges, or interest.
    (2) Importer no-net-cost assessment. With respect to assessments 
referred to in Sec. 1464.103, if an importer of burley or flue-cured 
tobacco fails to timely remit a no-net-cost assessment in accordance 
with the provisions in this subpart, such importer shall be liable, in 
addition to any no-net-cost assessment or other sum due and any late 
payment charges, to a marketing penalty at a per kilogram rate equal to 
75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole 
cent) for the respective kind of domestic tobacco (burley or flue-cured) 
for the respective domestic tobacco marketing year in which such 
imported tobacco was imported, on the quantity of tobacco as to which 
the failure occurs.
    (b) Exception to marketing penalty. A marketing penalty otherwise 
required by this paragraph may be forgiven if the assessment for which 
nonpayment of the penalty could be assessed is remitted not later than 
15 calendar days after the date otherwise required for the remittance by 
this subpart.
    (c) Notification of marketing penalty. Before a marketing penalty is 
assessed, the importer shall be notified of the pending assessment and 
shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the 
assessment of the penalty. Such notification will be by, and such 
hearing will be before, the Director or designee.
    (d) Marketing penalty reduction. The Executive Vice President, CCC, 
or designee, may reduce the amount of any marketing penalty for which a 
person otherwise would be liable under the provisions of this section 
upon finding that failure to comply was unintentional or without 
knowledge on the part of such person and that such reduction would not 
damage the tobacco program or the administration of this part.
    (e) Prohibition of use, processing or marketing of tobacco for which 
the assessments have not been paid; other remedies. The knowing use, 
processing, or marketing of tobacco in the commerce of

[[Page 634]]

the United States of any tobacco for which an assessment or related 
charge required or provided for by this subpart is past due, is 
prohibited. The penalties and other remedies provided in this section 
shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, other remedies that may 
be available.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.107  Recordkeeping.

    (a) Retention of records. Each importer of tobacco shall maintain 
all records that are relevant to any imported tobacco that is subject to 
an assessment in accordance with this subpart. Such records shall be 
retained for a period of three years following the date of entry of such 
tobacco. The burden of establishing compliance with this part shall be 
on the importer of the tobacco.
    (b) Examination of records and reports. The Executive Vice 
President, CCC, the Director, or any person authorized by one of such 
persons, or any auditor or agent of the Office of the Inspector General, 
is authorized to examine any records that such person has reason to 
believe are relevant to any matter pertinent to the payment of importer 
assessments under this subpart. Upon request of an authorized person, 
each importer shall make available for examination such records as are 
under such importer's control that may be relevant to imported tobacco 
that is subject to an assessment in accordance with this subpart or 
otherwise relevant to the administration of this subpart. Upon a failure 
to provide access or records, the Director may presume that such an 
inquiry would have produced information unfavorable to the party to the 
inquiry and shall make further determinations in the matter accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.108  Reconsideration and appeal.

    An importer may request the Director to reconsider any determination 
of the amount of any assessment due, any marketing penalty assessed, or

the date of the notification of such assessment, marketing penalty, or 
adverse determination. If the importer is dissatisfied with a 
determination rendered by the Director with respect to a request for 
reconsideration, such importer may appeal the determination to the 
Director, National Appeals Division, USDA. Any such appeal shall be 
handled in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 780.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.601  Applicability and basic terms for payments.

    This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions of the Tobacco 
Payment Program (TOPP). Under this program CCC will make direct payments 
on a farm relating to basic tobacco quotas or allotments established for 
the 2002 crop year under part I of subtitle B of title III of the 
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1311 et seq.) for eligible 
tobaccos. Payments are subject to the availability of funds and payment 
formulas set out in this part.
Sec. 1464.602 Administration.
    This subpart shall be administered by the Executive Vice President, 
CCC or his designee, under the general supervision of the Farm Service 
Agency (FSA), Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (Deputy 
Administrator). The program shall be carried out in the field by State 
and county FSA committees and FSA employees in accordance with this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.603  Eligibility.

    For a person to be considered an eligible person for purposes of 
this part, such person must own or control (in some cases only) a farm 
for which on the status date a basic 2002 crop quota or allotment for 
eligible tobacco was established under part I of subtitle B of title III 
of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1311 et seq.). 
Also, growers of that tobacco are eligible for

[[Page 635]]

payments to the extent provided for in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.604  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section shall apply to the 
administration of TOPP under this subpart. The definitions in Sec. Sec. 
718.2 and 723.104 of this title also apply to TOPP. The definitions in 
this section apply rather than the definitions in Sec. Sec. 718.2 and 
723.104 of this title to the extent that the definitions in those 
sections differ. The following terms shall have the following meanings:
    Controller means that person or entity who, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator, controls the land used to produce eligible tobacco 
and share in the risk of production.
    Eligible person means an owner, or (as applicable) controller of a 
farm for which a basic quota or allotment was established for the 2002 
crop year under part I of subtitle B of title III of the Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938 to the extent otherwise provided in these rules. 
Growers of that tobacco, as specified in this part, can also be eligible 
for payment. For this TOPP, an eligible person's status, as owner or 
controller or grower, will be determined as of July 1, 2002.
    Eligible tobacco means each of the following kinds of tobacco: Flue-
cured tobacco (types 11, 12, 13 and 14), burley tobacco (type 31), 
Virginia sun-cured tobacco (type 37), fire-cured tobacco (types 21-23), 
dark air-cured tobacco (types 35-36), and cigar filler/binder tobacco 
(types 42 through 44, 54 and 55).
    Grower means for flue-cured tobacco and cigar binder tobacco, a 
``producer,'' as defined below, for all other eligible tobaccos, as 
``grower/tenant,'' as defined below.
    Grower/tenant means a person or entity who provides labor to produce 
tobacco and share in the risk of production.
    Owner means with respect to a quota or allotment farm the person or 
entity who owns the land for which the tobacco quota or allotment was 
established for the 2002 crop as of the operative status date of July 1, 
2002 provided for in this part.
    Payment pounds means the pounds of tobacco for which a person is 
eligible to be paid under this subpart.
    Producer means a person or entity actively engaged in planting, 
growing, harvesting, and/or marketing of tobacco, or who shares in the 
risk of producing the crop.
    Share in the risk of production means having a direct financial 
stake in the success of the crop through a direct share in the actual 
proceeds from the actual marketing of the crop which share is 
conditional upon the success of that marketing. Farm owners who cash-
lease their farmland to a tobacco producer for the right to grow tobacco 
on that land and receive payment for such right regardless of whether or 
not a tobacco crop is marketed are not considered to share in the risk 
of production. Farm laborers who provide service in exchange for a wage 
and whose payment is not subject to the marketing or the tobacco crop 
are not considered to shared in the risk of production.
    TOPP means the Tobacco Payment Program.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.605  Sign up.

    (a) To apply for TOPP funds, persons must submit an application to 
the county FSA office by the date established by the Deputy 
Administrator. Late applications may be accepted if approved by the 
Deputy Administrator, if the lateness was the result of documented 
hardship.
    (b) Data furnished by the applicant will be used to determine 
eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; 
however, without it program benefits will not be provided.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.606  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.607  Payment benefits.

    (a) Payment will only be made subject to the availability of funds 
and only for eligible tobacco and for eligible persons who meet all 
conditions of eligibility for whom monies are provided by the terms of 
this section.
    (b) The total national payment amount made available for each kind 
of eligible tobacco for all claimants for that kind of tobacco, will be 
computed by multiplying the 2002 crop national

[[Page 636]]

poundage amount for that kind by 5.55 cents per pound.
    (c) The national poundage amount of a kind shall be, for those 
tobaccos for which poundage quotas were established for individual 
farms, the national basic quota, in total, for all farms. For all other 
tobaccos, the 2002 crop national poundage amount shall be determined by 
multiplying the national basic acreage allotment for that kind of 
tobacco by the following per acre conversion factors:
    (1) For fire-cured tobacco (type 21) 1,746 pounds;
    (2) For fire-cured tobacco (types 22-23) 2,676 pounds;
    (3) For dark air-cured tobacco (types 35-36) 2,475 pounds; and
    (4) For Virginia sun-cured tobacco (type 37) 1,502 pounds.
    (d) Once the national payment amount is determined for the eligible 
tobacco kind, it will for flue-cured tobacco (types 11-14) and for cigar 
filler tobacco (types 42-44 and 54-55) be divided into two equal parts, 
one for eligible owners and the other for eligible growers. Shares in 
the sub-accounts will be determined using basic poundage quota amounts 
for flue-cured tobacco and basic allotments for the cigar filler types. 
For cigar filler type allotments, a conversion to pounds will be made 
using the same conversion factor provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (e) For those eligible tobaccos not covered in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the national payment amount fund as determined under paragraph 
(b) of this section will be divided into three equal parts. Those parts 
shall be: one for eligible owners; one for eligible controllers; and one 
for eligible growers. Shares in each sub-account will be determined for 
burley tobacco using:
    (1) Basic poundage quota amounts for owners; and
    (2) Effective quota amounts for controllers and growers.
    (f) For all other tobaccos covered by paragraph (e) of this section, 
shares in each sub-account will be determined using:
    (1) Basic allotments for owners; and
    (2) Effective allotment amounts for controllers and growers. 
Allotments will be converted to pounds using the conversion factors in 
paragraph (c) of this section. ``Effective quotas'' and ``effective 
allotments'' means the amount of quota or allotment before any transfer 
which, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, occurred after a 
disaster.
    (g) Growers who otherwise meet the terms of this part, will qualify 
based on the full amount of the basic quota or effective quota or 
allotment, as the case may be, for the kind involved, even though they 
did not fully produce the operative pounds. Such growers must meet the 
labor, active engagement in farming, and risk of production elements of 
the ``grower'' definition of Sec. 1464.604, as applicable to their kind 
of tobacco. The Deputy Administrator may provide other elements of 
eligibility as necessary to accomplish the provisions of this part in 
accord with the operative legislation.
    (h) Payments will be made as soon as practicable.
    (i) The amount of TOPP funds allocated to the eligible persons in 
Georgia will be disbursed only if the State of Georgia agrees to use an 
equal amount of funds (not to exceed $13,000,000) to make payments in 
the same manner as provided for in this section.
    (j) All payments under this part are subject to the eligibility of 
funds. In the case where a payment to a farm is disputed the Deputy 
Administrator may require that all interested parties agree to the 
resolution of the dispute before any payment is made and may delay 
payments to the farm until any such disputes are resolved. Also, as 
determined appropriate to accomplish the goal that program payments be 
made expeditiously in a manner that is administratively efficient, the 
Deputy Administrator may properly exclude payments to a person who does 
not file a timely claim and all payments may be made to those parties 
whose claim to the payment is not challenged. Nothing in this section 
shall, however, be construed to prevent the agency from denying any 
payment to any person based upon a failure of that person to meet any 
eligibility criteria set forth in this part.

but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 1001; 15 U.S.C. 714m; 
and 31 U.S.C. 3729.

the practices as specified in the contract to ensure that operation and 
maintenance is occurring.


<R05>
Sec. 1465.23  Cost-share payments.

    (a)(1) The Federal share of cost-share payments to a participant 
will be 75 percent of the actual cost of an eligible practice. In no 
instance shall the total financial contributions for an eligible 
practice from all public and private entity sources exceed 100 percent 
of the actual cost of the practice.

practices through in-kind contributions, including labor and materials, 
providing the materials contributed meet the NRCS standards and 
specifications for the practice being installed.
    (3) Cost-share payments will not be made to a participant who has 
applied or initiated the application of a conservation practice prior to 
approval of the contract.
    (b) The total amount of cost-share payments paid to a person under

    (c) For purposes of applying the payment limitations provided for in 
this section, NRCS will use the provisions in 7 CFR part 1400 related to 
the definition of a ``person''and the limitation of payments, except 
that:
    (i) The provisions in part 1400, subpart C for determining whether 
persons are actively engaged in farming, subpart E for limiting payments 
to certain cash rent tenants, and subpart F as the provisions apply to 
determining whether foreign persons are eligible for payment, will not 
apply.
    (ii) With respect to land under an AMA Program contract which is 
inherited during the contract period, the $50,000 fiscal year limitation 
will not apply to the extent that the payments from any contracts on the 
inherited land cause an heir, who was party to an AMA Program contract 
on other lands prior to the inheritance, to exceed the annual limit.
    (iii) With regard to contracts on tribal land, Indian trust land, or 
BIA allotted land, payments exceeding one limitation may be made to the 
tribal venture if an official of the BIA or tribal official certifies in 
writing that no one person directly or indirectly will receive more than 
the limitation.
    (iv) The status of an individual or entity on the date of the 
application shall be the basis on which the determination of the number 
of persons involved in the farming operation is made.
    (d) The participant and NRCS must certify that a conservation 
practice is completed in accordance with the contract before NRCS will 
approve the payment of any cost-share payment.

[[Page 643]]


<R05>
Sec. 1465.24  Contract modification, extension, and transfer of land.

    (a) The participant and NRCS may modify a contract if the 
participant and NRCS agree to the contract modification.
    (b) Contracts that run less than ten years may be extended for up to 
the 10-year limit in order for the participant to complete the practices 
scheduled in the contract, if such extension is requested by the 
participant before the contract expires.
    (c) The parties may mutually agree to transfer a contract to a new 
participant. The transferee must be determined by NRCS to be eligible to 
participate in the AMA Program and shall assume full responsibility 
under the contract, including operation and maintenance of those 
conservation practices already installed and to be installed as a 
condition of the contract.
    (d) NRCS may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any 
assistance earned under the AMA Program if the participant sells or 
loses control of the land under an AMA Program contract and the new 
owner or controller is not eligible to participate in the AMA Program or 
refuses to assume responsibility under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1465.25  Contract violations and termination.

    (a)(1) If NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the 
terms of a contract or documents incorporated by reference into the 
contract, NRCS will give the participant a reasonable time, as 
determined by the State Conservationist, to correct the violation and 
comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto. If a 
participant continues in violation, the State Conservationist may 
terminate the AMA Program contract.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a contract termination shall be effective immediately upon a 
determination by the State Conservationist that the participant has 
submitted false information or filed a false claim, or engaged in any 
act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under 
the provisions of Sec. 1465.35, or in a case in which the actions of 
the party involved are deemed to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent 
to warrant a termination without delay.
    (b)(1) If NRCS terminates a contract, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for future payments under the contract and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received, plus interest determined in accordance 
with part 1403 of this chapter. The State Conservationist has the option 
of requiring only partial refund of the payments received if the State 
Conservationist determines that a previously installed conservation 
practice can function independently, is not affected by the violation or 
other conservation practices that would have been installed under the 
contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain the 
installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.
    (2) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract or the 
participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual 
payments have been made, the participant shall forfeit all rights for 
further payments under the contract and shall pay such liquidated 
damages as are prescribed in the contract. The State Conservationist 
will have the option to waive the liquidated damages depending upon the 
circumstances of the case.
    (3) When making all contract termination decisions, NRCS may reduce 
the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which 
reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the 
contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have 
prevented compliance with the contract.
    (4) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract if NRCS 
agrees based on NRCS's determination that termination is in the public 
interest.
    (5) In carrying out NRCS's role in this section, NRCS may consult 
with the local conservation district.

reasonable effort to contact the participant prior to the exercise of 
this provision.


<R05>
Sec. 1465.33  Performance based upon advice or action of representatives 
of NRCS.

    If a participant relied upon the advice or action of any authorized 
representative of NRCS, and did not know or have reason to know that the 
action or advice was improper or erroneous, the State Conservationist 
may accept the advice or action as meeting the requirements of the AMA 
Program and may grant relief, to the extent it is deemed desirable by 
NRCS, to provide a fair and equitable treatment because of the good-
faith reliance on the part of the participant.


<R05>
Sec. 1465.34  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof to any person shall be made without regard to

this chapter shall be applicable to contract payments.
    (b) Any producer entitled to any payment may assign any payments in 
accordance with regulations governing assignment of payment found at 
part 1404 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1465.35  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A producer who is determined to have erroneously represented any 
fact affecting an AMA Program determination made in accordance with this 
part shall not be entitled to contract payments and must refund to NRCS 
all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of 
this chapter.
    (b) A producer's interest in all contracts shall be terminated, and 
the producer shall refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest determined 
in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, received by such producer 
with respect to all contracts if it is determined that the producer 
knowingly:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the AMA Program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting an AMA Program determination.

and the degree of cooperation by local producers to achieve 
environmental improvements.
    (c) If the State Conservationist determines that the environmental 
values of two or more applications for cost-share payments or incentive 
payments are comparable, the State Conservationist will not assign a 
higher priority to the application solely because it would present the 
least cost to the program.
    (d) The ranking will not give preferential treatment to applications 
based on size of the operation.
    (e) The ranking will determine which applications will be awarded 
contracts. The approving authority for EQIP contracts will be the State 
Conservationist or designee except the approving authority for any EQIP 
contract greater than $100,000 is the NRCS Regional Conservationist.
    (f) The State Conservationist will make all information regarding 
priority resources concerns, how the EQIP program is implemented in the 
state, and the cost-list of eligible practices available to the public.

purposes of the program;
    (ii) Refund any program payments received with interest, and forfeit 
any future payments under the program, on the violation of a term or 
condition of the contract, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 
1466.26;
    (iii) Refund all program payments received on the transfer of the 
right and interest of the producer in land subject to the contract, 
unless the transferee of the right and interest agrees to assume all 
obligations of the contract, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 
1466.25;
    (iv) Implement a comprehensive nutrient management plan when the 
EQIP contract includes a waste storage or waste treatment facility; and
    (v) Supply information as may be required by NRCS to determine

operate and maintain each conservation practice installed under the 
contract for its intended purpose for the life span of the conservation 
practice as determined by NRCS. Conservation practices installed before 
the execution of a contract, but needed in the contract to obtain the 
environmental benefits agreed upon must be operated and maintained as 
specified in the contract. NRCS may periodically inspect a conservation 
practice during the lifespan of the practice as specified in the 
contract to ensure that operation and maintenance are occurring. When 
NRCS finds that a participant is not operating and maintaining practices 
in an appropriate manner, NRCS will request a refund of cost-share or 
incentive payments made for that practice under the contract.

as set in paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent that total 
financial contributions for a structural practice from all public and 
private sources exceed 100 percent of the actual cost of the practice.
    (b) Determining Incentive Payment levels. NRCS may provide incentive 
payments to participants for performing a land management practice or to 
develop a comprehensive nutrient management plan in an amount and at a 
rate necessary to encourage a participant to perform the practice that

[[Page 654]]

would not otherwise be initiated without government assistance. The 
State Conservationist or Designated Conservationist, with the advice of 
the State Technical Committee or Local Work Groups, may consider 
establishing limits on the extent of land management practices that may 
be included in a contract.
    (c) Cost-share rates and incentive payment levels for conservation 
practices will be established by the State Conservationist or Designated 
Conservationist with advice from the State Technical Committee and Local 
Work Groups. The State Conservationist or Designated Conservationist 
will develop a list of eligible conservation practices with varied cost-
share rates and incentive payment levels that considers:
    (1) The conservation practice cost-effectiveness and innovation,
    (2) The degree of treatment of priority natural resource concerns,
    (3) The number of resource concerns the practice will address,
    (4) The longevity of the practice's environmental benefits, and

2007.
    (b) To determine eligibility for payments, NRCS will use the 
following criteria:
    (1) The provisions in 7 CFR part 1400, Payment Limitation and 
Payment Eligibility, subparts A and G.
    (2) States, political subdivisions, and entities thereof will not be 
considered to be individuals or entities eligible for payment.
    (3) To be eligible to participate in EQIP, all individuals applying, 
either alone or as part of a joint operation, must provide a social 
security number. Where applicable; American Indians, Alaska Natives, and 
Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each 
individual eligible for payment.
    (4) To be eligible to participate in EQIP, any entity, as identified 
in 7 CFR part 1400, must provide a list of all members of the entity and 
embedded entities along with the members' social security numbers and 
percentage interest in the entity.
    (5) With regard to contracts on Indian Land, payments exceeding the 
payment limitation may be made to the Tribal venture if an official of 
BIA or a Tribal official certifies in writing that no one individual 
directly or indirectly will receive more than the limitation. The Tribal 
entity must also provide, annually, listing of individuals and payments 
made, by social security number or other unique identification number, 
during the previous year for calculation of overall payment limitations. 
The Tribal entity must also produce, at the request of NRCS, proof of 
payments made to the individuals that incurred the costs for 
installation of the practices.
    (6) Any cooperative association of producers that markets 
commodities for producers will not be considered to be a person eligible 
for payment.
    (7) Eligibility for payments in accordance with 7 CFR part 1400, 
subpart G, average adjusted gross income limitation, will be determined 
at the time of contract approval.
    (8) Eligibility for higher cost-share payments in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section will be determined at the time of approval 
of the contract.
    (9) Any participant that utilizes a unique identification number as 
an alternative to a social security number will utilize only that 
identifier for any and all other EQIP contracts that the participant is 
party to. Violators will be considered to have provided fraudulent 
representation and be subject to full penalties of section 1466.35.
    (10) A participant will not be eligible for cost-share or incentive 
payments for conservation practices on eligible land if the participant 
receives cost-

[[Page 655]]

share payments or other benefits for the same practice on same land 
under any other conservation program administered by USDA.
    (11) Before NRCS will approve and issue any cost-share or incentive 
payment, the participant must certify that the conservation practice has 
been completed in accordance with the contract, and NRCS or other 
approved Technical Service Provider certifies that the practice has been 
carried out in accordance with the conservation practice standards of 
the applicable NRCS field office technical guide.
    (12) The provisions of 7 CFR 1412.505 except that refunds will be 
determined by the State Conservationist.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.25  Contract modifications and transfers of land.

    (a) The participant and NRCS may modify a contract if the 
participant and NRCS agree to the contract modification and the EQIP 
plan of operations is revised in accordance with NRCS requirements and 
is approved by the Designated Conservationist.
    (b) The participant and NRCS may agree to transfer a contract to 
another producer. The transferee must be determined by NRCS to be 
eligible to participate in EQIP and must assume full responsibility 
under the contract, including operation and maintenance of those 
conservation practices already installed and to be installed as a 
condition of the contract.
    (c) NRCS may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any 
financial assistance earned under EQIP if the participant sells or loses 
control of the land under an EQIP contract and the new owner or 
controller is not eligible to participate in the program or refuses to 
assume responsibility under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.26  Contract violations and termination.

    (a)(1) If NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the 
terms of a contract or documents incorporated by reference into the 
contract, NRCS shall give the participant a reasonable time, as 
determined by NRCS, to correct the violation and comply with the terms 
of the contract and attachments thereto. If a participant continues in 
violation, NRCS may terminate the EQIP contract.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a contract termination shall be effective immediately upon a 
determination by NRCS that the participant has submitted false 
information or filed a false claim, or engaged in any act, scheme, or 
device for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted 
under the provisions of Sec. 1466.35, or in a case in which the actions 
of the party involved are deemed to be sufficiently purposeful or 
negligent to warrant a termination without delay.
    (b)(1) If NRCS terminates a contract, the participant will forfeit 
all rights for future payments under the contract and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received, plus interest determined in accordance 
with 7 CFR part 1403. NRCS may exercise the option of requiring only 
partial refund of the payments received if a previously installed 
conservation practice can function independently, is not adversely 
affected by the violation or the absence of other conservation practices 
that would have been installed under the contract, and the participant 
agrees to operate and maintain the installed conservation practice for 
the lifespan of the practice.
    (2) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract or the 
participant voluntarily terminates the contract, the participant will 
forfeit all rights for further payments under the contract and shall pay 
such liquidated damages as are prescribed in the contract. NRCS will 
have the option to waive the liquidated damages, depending upon the 
circumstances of the case.
    (3) When making contract termination decisions, NRCS may reduce the 
amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion that reflects 
the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the contract or 
the hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented 
compliance with the contract.
    (4) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract if NRCS 
determines that termination is in the public interest.

[[Page 656]]

    (5) In carrying out its role in this section, NRCS may consult with 
the local conservation district.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.27  Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG).

    (a) Definitions. In addition to the terms defined in Sec. 1466.3 of 
this part, the following definitions shall be applicable to this 
section:

meets the definitions of EQIP as defined in 7 CFR 1466.
    (2) Grant agreement means a document describing a relationship 
between NRCS and a State or local government, or other recipient 
whenever the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of a 
thing of value to a recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of 
support or stimulation authorized by Federal law, and substantial 
Federal involvement is not anticipated.
    (3) Grant Review Board consists of the NRCS Deputy Chief for 
Programs, Deputy Chief for Science and Technology, Deputy Chief for Soil 
Survey and Resource Assessment, one Regional Assistant Chief, and one 
State Conservationist. The Review Board makes recommendations for grant 
awards to the Chief.
    (4) Peer Review Panel means a panel consisting of Federal and non-
Federal technical advisors who possess expertise in a discipline or 
disciplines deemed important to provide a technical evaluation of 
project proposals submitted under this notice.
    (5) Project means the activities as defined within the scope of the 
grant agreement.
    (6) Project Director means the individual responsible for the 
technical direction and management of the project as designated in the 
application.
    (b) Purpose and scope. (1) Purpose. The purpose of CIG is to 
stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation 
approaches and technologies while leveraging Federal investment in 
environmental enhancement and protection, in conjunction with 
agricultural production. Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, 
NRCS will administer CIG in accordance with this section. Unless 
otherwise provided for in this section, the provisions of 7 CFR 3015 and 
related Departmental regulations will be used to administer grants under 
CIG.
    (2) Geographic scope. Applications for CIG are accepted from the 
fifty States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
    (3) Program scope. Grants will be awarded using a two-tiered 
process. A nationwide grants competition will be announced in the 
Federal Register. In addition, at the Chief's discretion, each State 
Conservationist may implement a separate State-level component of CIG.
    (4) Program focus. Applications for CIG should demonstrate the use 
of innovative approaches to leverage Federal investment in environmental 
enhancement and protection, in conjunction with agricultural production. 
CIG will fund projects that promote innovative on-the-ground 
conservation, including pilot projects and field demonstrations of 
promising approaches or technologies. CIG projects are expected to lead 
to the transfer of conservation technologies, management systems, and 
innovative approaches (such as market-based systems) into NRCS technical 
manuals and guides, or to the private sector. Technologies and 
approaches that are eligible for funding in the project's geographic 
area through EQIP are not eligible for CIG funding.
    (5) Innovative conservation projects or activities. For the purposes 
of CIG, the proposed innovative project or activity must encompass the 
development and field testing, evaluation, and implementation of:
    (i) Conservation adoption incentive systems, including market-based 
systems; or,
    (ii) Promising conservation technologies, practices, systems, 
procedures, and approaches.
    To be given priority consideration, the innovative project or 
activity:
    (iii) Will have been studied sufficiently to indicate a good 
probability for success;
    (iv) Demonstrates, tests, evaluates, or verifies environmental 
(soil, water,

[[Page 657]]

air, plants, and animal) effectiveness, utility, affordability, and 
usability in the field;
    (v) Adapts conservation technologies, practices, systems, 
procedures, approaches, and incentive systems to improve performance, 
and encourage adoption;
    (vi) Introduces conservation systems, approaches, and procedures 
from another geographic area or agricultural sector; and
    (vii) Adapts conservation technology, management, or incentive 
systems to improve performance.
    (c) Availability of funding. (1) CIG funding will be available for 
single-or multi-year projects. Funding for CIG will be announced in the 
Federal Register through a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Chief will 
determine the funding level for CIG on an annual basis. Funds for CIG 
are derived from funds made available for EQIP. The Chief may establish 
funding limits for individual grants.
    (2) Selected applicants may receive grants of up to 50 percent of 
the total project cost. Applicants must provide non-Federal funding for 
at least 50 percent of the project cost, of which up to one-half (25 
percent of total project cost) may be from in-kind contributions. An 
exception regarding matching funds may be made for grants that are 
awarded to either a Beginning or Limited Resource Farmer or Rancher, or 
Indian Tribe, or a community-based organization comprised of or 
representing these entities. Up to 75 percent of the required matching 
funds for these projects may derive from in-kind contributions.
    (3) CIG is designed to provide financial assistance to grantees. 
Procurement of any technical assistance required to carry out a project 
is the responsibility of the grantee. Technical oversight for grant 
projects will be provided by a Federal grant representative, who will be 
designated by NRCS.
    (4) There are some costs that grantees may not cover using CIG 
funds, such as costs incurred prior to the effective date of the grant, 
entertainment costs, or renovation or refurbishment of buildings or 
facilities. A detailed list of costs not allowed will be published in 
the RFP.
    (d) Natural resource conservation concerns. CIG applications must 
describe the use of innovative approaches or technologies to address a 
natural resource conservation concern or concerns. The natural resource 
concerns for CIG will be identified by the Chief, and may change each 
year. The natural resource concerns will be published in the RFP.
    (e) Eligibility information. (1) Organization or individual 
eligibility. To be eligible, CIG applicants must be an Indian Tribe; 
State or local unit of government; non-governmental organization; or 
individual.
    (2) Project eligibility. To be eligible, projects must involve 
landowners who meet the eligibility requirements of Sec. 1466.8(b)(1) 
through (3) of this part. Further, all agricultural producers 
participating in a CIG project must meet those eligibility requirements.
    (3) Beginning and Limited Resource Farmers and Ranchers, and Indian 
Tribes. Up to 10 percent of the total funds available for CIG may be 
set-aside for applications from either a Beginning or Limited Resource 
Farmer or Rancher, or Indian Tribe, or a community-based organization 
comprised of or representing these entities. Funds not awarded from the 
set-aside pool will revert back into the general CIG funding pool.
    (f) Application and submission information. The CIG RFP will contain 
guidance on how to apply for the grants competition. CIG will be 
advertised through the Federal Register, the NRCS Web site, and 
grants.gov. Grant applications will be available on the NRCS Web site, 
or by contacting NRCS at the address provided in the RFP. CIG grant 
applications will consist of standard cover sheet and budget forms, in 
addition to a narrative project description and required legal 
declarations and certifications.
    (g) Application review and grant awards. Complete applications will 
be evaluated by a peer review panel and scored based on the Criteria for 
Proposal Evaluation identified in the RFP. Scored applications will be 
forwarded to a Grant Review Board. The Grant Review Board will make 
recommendations for awards to the Chief. Final award selections will be 
made by the

[[Page 658]]

Chief. Grant awards will be made by the NRCS National Office after 
selection of the grantees is made and after the grantee agrees to the 
terms and conditions of the NRCS Grant document.
    (h) State component. (1) At the discretion of the Chief, each State 
Conservationist has the option of implementing a State-level CIG 
component. A State program will follow the requirements of this section, 
except for those features described in this paragraph (h).
    (2) Funding availability, application, and submission information 
for State competitions will be announced through public notices (and on 
the State NRCS Web site), separately from the national program. The 
State component will emphasize projects that cover limited geographic 
areas, including individual farms, multi-county areas, or small 
watersheds.
    (3) The State Conservationist will determine the funding level for 
the grants competition, with individual grants not to exceed $75,000.
    (4) The State Conservationist may choose to adhere to the CIG 
national natural resource concerns, or may select a subset of those 
concerns that more closely match the natural resource concerns in his or 
her State.
    (5) Applications will be scored by the State Technical Committee, or 
a sub-committee thereof, based on the national Criteria for Proposal 
Evaluation published in the CIG RFP. Scored applications will be 
forwarded to the State Conservationist, who will make the award 
selections.
    (6) In addition to abiding by the in-kind contribution exception for 
Limited Resource and Beginning Farmers and Ranchers, and Indian Tribes 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the State Conservationist in each 
participating State will determine if and how to provide additional 
special consideration to underserved groups.
    (i) Grant agreement. The CCC, through NRCS, will use a grant 
agreement with selected grantees to document participation in CIG.
    (j) Patents and inventions. Allocation of rights to patents and 
inventions shall be in accordance with USDA regulation 7 CFR 3019.36. 
This regulation provides that small businesses normally may retain the 
principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed with USDA 
support. In accordance with 7 CFR 3019.2, this provision will also apply 
to commercial organizations for the purposes of CIG. USDA receives a 
royalty-free license for Federal Government use, reserves the right to 
require the patentee to license others in certain circumstances, and 
requires that anyone exclusively licensed to sell the invention in the 
United States must normally manufacture it domestically.
    (k) Violations. A person found in violation of this section is 
subject to the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 3015 and related 
Departmental regulations.

    (6) Protection of flora and fauna which contributes to the Nation's 
natural heritage; and
    (7) Contribution to educational and scientific scholarship.
    Wetland restoration means the rehabilitation of degraded or lost 
habitat in a manner such that:
    (1) The original vegetation community and hydrology are, to the 
extent practical, re-established; or
    (2) A community different from what likely existed prior to 
degradation of the site is established. The hydrology and native self-
sustaining vegetation being established will substantially replace 
original habitat functions and values but does not involve more than 30 
percent of the wetland restoration area.
    WRP means the Wetlands Reserve Program.
    WRPO means the Wetlands Reserve Plan of Operations.

Sec. 1467.4  Program requirements.

    (a) General. Under the WRP, the Department may purchase conservation 
easements from, or enter into restoration cost-share agreements with, 
eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate in the restoration and 
protection of wetlands and associated lands. To participate in WRP, a 
landowner will agree to the implementation of a Wetlands Reserve Plan of 
Operations (WRPO), the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, 
maintain, and manage the hydrologic conditions of inundation or 
saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of 
eligible lands. The Department may provide cost-share assistance for the 
activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management of wetland functions and values. Specific 
restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management 
actions may be undertaken by the landowner or other Department designee.
    (b) Acreage limitations. (1) Except for areas devoted to windbreaks 
or shelterbelts after November 28, 1990, no more than 25 percent of the 
total cropland in any county, as determined by the Farm Service Agency, 
may be enrolled in the CRP and the WRP, and no more than 10 percent of 
the total cropland in the county may be subject to an easement acquired 
under the CRP and the WRP.
    (2) The Department and the Farm Service Agency shall concur before a 
waiver of either the 25 percent limit or the 10 percent limit of this 
subsection can be approved for an easement proposed for enrollment in 
the WRP. Such a waiver will only be approved if it will not adversely 
affect the local economy, and operators in the county are having 
difficulties complying with the conservation plans implemented under 16 
U.S.C. 3812.
    (c) Landowner eligibility. The Department may determine that a 
person is not eligible to participate in the WRP or receive any WRP 
payment because the person did not comply with the provisions of 7 CFR 
part 12. To be eligible to enroll an easement in the WRP, a person must:

[[Page 663]]

    (1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is 
sought;
    (2) Have been the landowner of such land for the 12 months prior to 
the time the intention to participate is declared unless it is 
determined by the State Conservationist that the land was acquired by 
will or success as a result of the death of the previous landowner, the 
ownership change occurred due to foreclosure on the land and the owner 
of the land immediately before the foreclosure exercises a right of 
redemption from the mortgage holder in accordance with State law, or 
that adequate assurances have been presented to the State 
Conservationist that the new landowner of such land did not acquire such 
land for the purpose of placing it in the WRP; and
    (3) Agree to provide such information to the Department as the 
agency deems necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of 
eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation 
purposes.
    (d) Eligible land. (1) The Department shall determine whether land 
is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands 
may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful 
restoration of wetland functions and values when considering the cost of 
acquiring the easement and restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management costs.
    (2) Land shall only be considered eligible for enrollment in the WRP 
if the Department determines, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, that:
    (i) Such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and 
functions;
    (ii) The likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and 
the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the 
program, taking into consideration the cost of such restoration; and
    (iii) Such land meets the criteria of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) The following land may be eligible for enrollment in the WRP, 
which land may be identified by the Department pursuant to regulations 
and implementing policies pertaining to wetland conservation found at 7 
CFR part 12, as:
    (i) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions, farmed wetlands, prior 
converted cropland, commenced conversion wetlands, farmed wetland 
pastures, and lands substantially altered by flooding so as to develop 
wetland functions and values;
    (ii) Former or degraded wetlands that occur on lands that have been 
used or are currently being used for the production of food and fiber, 
including rangeland and forest production lands, where the hydrology has 
been significantly degraded or modified and will be substantially 
restored;
    (iii) Riparian areas along streams or other waterways that link or, 
after restoring the riparian area, will link wetlands which are 
protected by an easement or other device or circumstance that achieves 
the same objectives as an easement:
    (iv) Land adjacent to the restored wetland which would contribute 
significantly to wetland functions and values including buffer areas, 
wetland creations, and non-cropped natural wetlands, but not more than 
the State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical 
Committee, determines is necessary for such contribution;
    (v) Other wetlands that would not otherwise be eligible but would 
significantly add to the wetland functions and values; and
    (vi) Wetlands that have been restored under a private, State, or 
Federal restoration program with an easement or deed restriction with a 
duration of less than 30 years.
    (4) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must be configured 
in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management of 
the area for easement purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program 
objectives.
    (e) Ineligible land. The following land is not eligible for 
enrollment in the WRP:
    (1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was commended after 
December 23, 1985;
    (2) Land that contains timber stands established under a CRP 
contract or pasture land established to trees under a CRP contract.
    (3) Lands owned by an agency of the United States;

[[Page 664]]

    (4) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction with a duration 
of 30 years or more prohibiting the production of agricultural 
commodities; and,
    (5) Lands where implementation of restoration practices would be 
futile due to on-site or off-site conditions.
    (f) Enrollment of CRP lands. Land subject to an existing CRP 
contract may be enrolled into the WRP only if the land and landowner 
meet the requirements of this part, and the enrollment is requested by 
the landowner and agreed to by the Department. To enroll in WRP, the CRP 
contract for the property shall be terminated or otherwise modified 
subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon by the 
Farm Service Agency and the landowner.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.5  Application procedures.

    (a) Application for participation. To apply for enrollment, a 
landowner must submit an Application for Participation in the WRP. The 
application must be submitted during an announced period for such 
submissions.
    (b) Preliminary agency actions. By filing an Application for 
Participation, the landowner consents to a Department representative 
entering upon the land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions 
and values, and for other activities such as the development of the 
preliminary WRPO that are necessary or desirable for the Department to 
make offers of enrollment. The landowner is entitled to accompany a 
Department representative on any site visits.
    (c) Voluntary reduction in compensation. In order to enhance the 
probability of enrollment in WRP, a landowner may voluntarily offer to 
accept a lesser payment than is being offered by the Department.

42143, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.6  Establishing priority for enrollment of properties in WRP.

    (a) The Department shall place priority on the enrollment of those 
lands that will maximize wildlife values (especially related to 
enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife); have the 
least likelihood of re-conversion and loss of these wildlife values at 
the end of the WRP enrollment period; and that involve State, local, or 
other partnership matching funds and participation.
    (b) Ranking considerations. Based on applications for participation, 
the State Conservationist, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and the State Technical Committee, will rank properties 
based on: estimated costs of restoration and easement acquisition, 
availability of matching funds, significance of wetland functions and 
values, estimated success of restoration measures, and the duration of a 
proposed easement with permanent easements being given priority over 
non-permanent easements.
    (c) The Department may place higher priority on certain geographic 
regions of the State where restoration of wetlands may better achieve 
Department State and regional goals and objectives.
    (d) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, the State 
Conservationist may enroll eligible lands at any time in order to 
encompass total wetland areas subject to multiple ownership or otherwise 
to achieve program objectives. Similarly, the State Conservationist may, 
at any time, exclude otherwise eligible lands if the participation of 
the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of 
the wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling to participate.

[60 FR 28514, June 1, 1995. Redesignated and amended at 61 FR 42141, 
42142, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.7  Enrollment of easements.

    (a) Offers of enrollment. Based on the priority ranking, the 
Department will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance 
into the program for which the landowner has 15 calendar days to sign a 
letter of intent to continue. Department will select lands to maximize 
environmental benefits per expenditure of Federal funds.
    (b) Effect of letter of intent to continue (enrollment). An offer of 
tentative acceptance into the program does not bind the Department or 
the United States to acquire an easement, nor

[[Page 665]]

does it bind the landowner to convey an easement or agree to WRPO 
activities. However, receipt of an executed letter of intent to continue 
will authorize the Department to proceed.
    (c) Acceptance of offer of enrollment. A contract will be presented 
by the Department to the landowner, which will describe the easement 
area; the easement terms and conditions; and other terms and conditions 
for participation that may be required by the Department. A landowner 
accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing contract.
    (d) Effect of the acceptance of the offer. After the contract is 
executed by Department and the landowner, the Department will proceed 
with various easement acquisition activities, which may include 
conducting a survey of the easement area, securing necessary 
subordination agreements, procuring title insurance, and conducting 
other activities necessary to record the easement or implement the WRPO.
    (e) Withdrawal of offers. Prior to execution by the United States 
and the landowner of the contract, the Department may withdraw its offer 
anytime due to availability of funds, inability to clear title, or other 
reasons. The offer to the landowner shall be void if not executed by the 
landowner within the time specified. The date of the offer shall be the 
date of notification to the landowner of tentative acceptance.

42142, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.8  Compensation for easements.

    (a) Establishment of rates. (1) The State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, shall determine 
easement payment rates to be applied to specific geographic areas within 
the State or to individual easement areas.
    (2) In order to provide for better uniformity among States, the 
Regional Conservationist and Chief may review and adjust, as 
appropriate, State or other geographically based easement payment rates.
    (b) Determination of easement payment rates. (1) Easement payment 
rates will be based upon analyses of the values of the lands when used 
for agricultural purposes. The landowner will receive the lesser of the 
following:
    (i) the geographic area rate;
    (ii) the value based on a market appraisal analysis/assessment; or
    (iii) the landowner offer.
    (2) Each State Conservationist will determine the easement payment 
rates using the best information which is readily available in that 
State for assessing the values of land for agricultural purposes. Such 
information may include: soil types, type(s) of crops capable of being 
grown, production history, location, real estate market values, 
appraisals and market analyses, and tax rates and assessments. The State 
Conservationist may consult with other Federal agencies, real estate 
market experts, appraisers, local tax authorities, and other entities or 
persons which may provide information on productivity and market 
conditions.
    (3) Easement payments for non-permanent easements will be less than 
those for permanent easements because the quality and duration of the 
ecological benefits derived from a non-permanent easement are 
significantly less than those derived from a permanent easement on the 
same land. Additionally, the economic value of the easement interests 
being acquired is less for a non-permanent easement than that associated 
with a permanent easement. An easement payment for the short-term 30-
year easement shall not be less than 50 percent nor more than 75 percent 
of that which would have been paid for a permanent easement.
    (c) Maximum payments. In order to ensure that limited program funds 
are expended to maximize program benefits, the State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish a maximum 
easement payment for any one easement within a State or for geographic 
areas within a State.
    (d) Preliminary estimates of easement payments. Upon request of the 
landowner prior to filing an application for enrollment, a landowner may 
be appraised of the maximum easement payment rates.
    (e) Acceptance of offered easement compensation. (1) The Department 
will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of 
the easement payment which is offered by the Department. The easement 
payment

[[Page 666]]

may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and rights 
to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement. By voluntarily 
participating in the program, a landowner waives any claim to additional 
compensation based on fair market value.
    (2) Annual easement payments may be made in no less than 5 annual 
payments and no more than 30 annual payments of equal or unequal size.
    (f) Reimbursement of a landowner's expenses. For completed easement 
conveyances, the Department will reimburse landowners for their fair and 
reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for surveying and related costs, 
as determined by the Department. The State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish maximum 
payments to reimburse landowners for reasonable expenses.
    (g) Tax implications of easement conveyances. Subject to applicable 
regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, a landowner may be eligible 
for a bargain sale tax deduction which is the difference between the 
fair market value of the easement conveyed to the United States and the 
easement payment made to the landowner. The Department disclaims any 
representations concerning the tax implications of any easement or cost-
share transaction.
    (h) Payment limitation on non-permanent easements. With respect to 
non-permanent easements, the annual amount of easement payments to any 
person may not exceed $50,000 except for:
    (1) Payments made pursuant to projects involving partnership funding 
or participation; or
    (2) Payment received by a State, political subdivision, or agency 
thereof in connection with agreements entered into under a special 
wetland and environmental enhancement program carried out by that entity 
that has been approved by Department.
    (i) If easement payments are calculated on a per acre basis, 
adjustment to stated easement payment will be made based on final 
determination of acreage.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.9  Cost-share payments.

    (a) The Department may share the cost with landowners of restoring 
the enrolled land as provided in the WRPO. The amount and terms and 
conditions of the cost-share assistance shall be subject to the 
following restrictions on the costs of establishing or installing 
practices specified in the WRPO:
    (1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement, the Department 
shall offer to pay not less than 75 percent nor more than 100 percent of 
such costs; and
    (2) On enrolled land subject to a non-permanent easement or 
restoration cost-share agreement, the Department shall offer to pay not 
less than 50 percent nor more than 75 percent of such costs. Restoration 
cost-share payments offered by Department for the short-term, 30-year 
easements shall be 50 to 75 percent.
    (b) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by the 
Department that an eligible practice or an identifiable unit of the 
practice has been established in compliance with appropriate standards 
and specifications. Identified practices may be implemented by the 
landowner or other designee.
    (c) Cost-share payments may be made for the establishment and 
installation of additional eligible practices, or the maintenance or 
replacement of an eligible practice, but only if Department determines 
the practice is needed to meet the objectives of the easement, and the 
failure of the original practices was due to reasons beyond the control 
of the landowner.
    (d) A landowner may seek additional cost-share assistance from other 
public or private organizations as long as the activities funded are in 
compliance with this part. In no event shall the landowner receive an 
amount which exceeds 100 percent of the total actual cost of the 
restoration.

Sec. 1467.10  Easement participation requirements.

    (a) To enroll land in WRP, a landowner shall grant an easement to 
the

[[Page 667]]

United States. The easement shall require that the easement area be 
maintained in accordance with WRP goals and objectives for the duration 
of the term of the easement, including the restoration, protection, 
enhancement, maintenance, and management of wetland and other land 
functions and values.
    (b) For the duration of its term, the easement shall require, at a 
minimum, that the landowner, and the landowner's heirs, successors and 
assigns, shall cooperate in the restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management of the land in accordance with the easement 
and with the terms of the WRPO. In addition, the easement shall grant to 
the United States, through the Department:
    (1) A right of access to the easement area;
    (2) The right to permit compatible uses of the easement area, 
including such activities as hunting and fishing, managed timber 
harvest, or periodic haying or grazing, if such use is consistent with 
the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetland resources for 
which the easement was established;
    (3) All rights, title and interest in the easement area subject to 
compatible uses reserved to the landowner; and,
    (4) The right to perform restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management activities on the easement area.
    (c) The landowner shall convey title to the easement which is 
acceptable to the Department. The landowner shall warrant that the 
easement granted to the United States is superior to the rights of all 
others, except for exceptions to the title which are deemed acceptable 
by the Department.
    (d) The landowner shall:
    (1) Comply with the terms of the easement;
    (2) Comply with all terms and conditions of any associated contract;
    (3) Agree to the permanent retirement of any existing cropland base 
and allotment history for the easement area under any program 
administered by the Secretary, as determined by the Farm Service Agency;
    (4) Agree to the long-term restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management of the easement in accordance with the terms 
of the easement and related agreements;
    (5) Have the option to enter into an agreement with governmental or 
private organizations to assist in carrying out any landowner 
responsibilities on the easement area;
    (6) Agree that each person who is subject to the easement shall be 
jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the easement and 
the provisions of this part and for any refunds or payment adjustment 
which may be required for violation of any terms or conditions of the 
easement or the provisions of this part.

Sec. 1467.11  The WRPO development.

    (a) The development of the WRPO shall be made through the local 
Department representative, in consultation with the State Technical 
Committee, and with consideration of site specific technical input from 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Conservation District.
    (b) The WRPO shall specify the manner in which the enrolled land 
shall be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to 
accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO shall be developed to 
ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife 
benefits and wetland functions and values will result.

Sec. 1467.12  Modifications.

    (a) Easements. (1) After an easement has been recorded, no 
modification will be made in the easement except by mutual agreement 
with the Chief and the landowner. The Chief will consult with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and the Conservation District prior to making 
any modifications to easements.
    (2) Approved modifications will be made only in an amended easement 
which is duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real 
estate practices, including requirements for title approval, 
subordination of liens, and recordation.

[[Page 668]]

    (3) The Chief may approve modifications to facilitate the practical 
administration and management of the easement area or the program so 
long as the modification will not adversely affect the wetland functions 
and values for which the easement was acquired.
    (4) Modifications must result in equal or greater environmental and 
economic values to the United States.
    (b) WRPO. Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable 
law, the State Conservationist may approve modifications to the WRPO 
that do not affect provisions of the easement in consultation with the 
landowner and the State Technical Committee and following consideration 
of site specific technical input from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and the Conservation District. Any WRPO modification must meet WRP 
program objectives, and must result in equal or greater wildlife 
benefits, wetland functions and values, ecological and economic values 
to the United States. Modifications to the WRPO which are substantial 
and affect provisions of the easement will require agreement from the 
landowner and require execution of an amended easement.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.13  Transfer of land.

    (a) Offers voided. Any transfer of the property prior to the 
landowner acceptance into the program shall void the offer of 
enrollment. At the option of the State Conservationist, an offer can be 
extended to the new landowner if the new landowner agrees to the same or 
more restrictive easement and contract terms and conditions.
    (b) Payments to landowners. (1) For easements with multiple annual 
payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original 
landowner unless the Department receives an assignment of proceeds.
    (2) The new landowner or purchaser shall be held responsible for 
assuring completion of all measures and practices required by the 
contract. Eligible cost-share payments shall be made to the new 
landowner upon presentation of an assignment of rights or other evidence 
that title had passed.
    (c) Claims to payments. With respect to any and all payments owed to 
landowners, the United States shall bear no responsibility for any full 
payments or partial distributions of funds between the original 
landowner and the landowner's successor. In the event of a dispute or 
claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, the Department may 
withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement 
or adjudication on the rights to the funds.

Sec. 1467.14  Violations and remedies.

    (a) In the event of a violation of the easement or any contract 
directly involving the landowner, the landowner shall be given 
reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the 
violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional 
time as the State Conservationist may allow.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Department 
reserves the right to enter upon the easement area at any time to remedy 
deficiencies or easement violations. Such entry may be made at the 
discretion of the Department when such actions are deemed necessary to 
protect important wetland functions and values or others rights of the 
United States under the easement. The landowner shall be liable for any 
costs incurred by the United States as a result of the landowner's 
negligence or failure to comply with easement or contractual 
obligations.
    (c) In addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies as may 
be available to the United States under applicable law, the Department 
may withhold any easement and cost-share payments owing to landowners at 
any time there is a material breach of the easement covenants or any 
contract. Such withheld funds may be used to offset costs incurred by 
the United States in any remedial actions or retained as damages 
pursuant to court order or settlement agreement.

[[Page 669]]

    (d) The United States shall be entitled to recover any and all 
administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, 
associated with any enforcement or remedial action.

employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any 
part of any program payment otherwise due or paid such landowner during 
the applicable period may be withheld or be required to be refunded with 
interest thereon, as determined appropriate by the Department.
    (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, 
fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of payments for 
cost-share practices or easements for the purpose of obtaining a payment 
to which a person would otherwise not be entitled.
    (c) A landowner who succeeds to the responsibilities under this part 
shall report in writing to the Department any interest of any kind in 
enrolled land that is held by a predecessor or any lender. A failure of

<R05>
Sec. 1468.1  Purpose.

    (a) Through the Conservation Farm Option (CFO), the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) provides financial assistance to eligible farmers and 
ranchers to address soil, water, and related natural resource concerns, 
water quality protection or improvement; wetland restoration and 
protection; wildlife habitat development and protection; and other 
similar conservation purposes on their lands in an environmentally 
beneficial and cost-effective manner. The Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS) may provide technical assistance, upon request by the 
producer or landowner.
    (b) The CCC provides a single contract and annual payments for 
implementation of innovative and environmentally-sound methods for 
addressing natural resource concerns for producers of wheat, feed 
grains, cotton, and rice, resulting in consolidation of payments that 
would have been available under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), 
the Wetlands Reserve Program cost-share agreements (WRP), and the 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). CFO participation is 
determined through two step process: first, the Chief, with FSA 
concurrence, selects CFO pilot project areas based on proposals 
submitted by the public; then CCC accepts applications from eligible 
producers or owners within the selected pilot project area.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.2  Administration.

forth below.
    (b) NRCS will:
    (1) Provide overall program management and implementation for CFO;
    (2) Establish policies, procedures, priorities, and guidance for 
program implementation, including determination of pilot project areas;
    (3) Establish annual payment rates consistent with EQIP, CRP, and 
WRP payment rates;
    (4) Make funding decisions and determine allocations of program 
funds, with FSA concurrence;
    (5) Determine eligibility of practices;
    (6) Provide technical leadership for conservation planning and 
implementation, quality assurance, and evaluation of program 
performance.
    (c) FSA will:
    (1) Be responsible for the administrative processes and procedures

    (a) CCC may periodically solicit proposals from the public to 
establish pilot project areas in the Federal Register.
    (b) Pilot projects may involve one or more participants. Each owner 
or producer within an approved pilot project area must submit an 
application in order to be considered for enrollment in the CFO. This 
pilot project area may be a watershed, a subwatershed, an area, or an 
individual farm that can be geographically described and has specific 
environmental sensitivities or significant soil, water, and related 
natural resource concerns. The pilot project area must have acreage 
enrolled in a production flexibility contract, which is authorized by 
the Agricultural Marketing and Transition Act of 1996. After these pilot 
project area proposals are received, the Chief, with FSA concurrence, 
will select proposals for funding.
    (c) CCC will select pilot project areas based on the extent the 
individual proposal:
    (1) Demonstrates innovative approaches to conservation program 
delivery and administration;
    (2) Proposes innovative conservation technologies and system;
    (3) Provides assurances that the greatest amount of environmental 
benefits will be delivered in a cost effective manner;
    (4) Ensures effective monitoring and evaluation of the pilot effort;

<R05>
Sec. 1468.5  General provisions.

    (a) Program participation is voluntary.
    (b) Participation in the CFO is limited to producers of wheat, feed 
grains, cotton, or rice who have a production flexibility contract, in 
accordance with part 1412 of this chapter, on the farm enrolling in CFO 
and who are eligible for either CRP (7 CFR part 1410), EQIP (7 CFR part 
1466), or WRP (7 CFR part 1467).
    (c) The participant is responsible for the development of a 
conservation farm plan for the farm or ranch and may request assistance 
from NRCS or a third party in writing both the conservation farm plan 
and installing the

[[Page 673]]

practices outlined within the plan. Conservation practices in the 
conservation farm plan that would have been eligible for payment under 
CRP, EQIP, or cost-share agreements under WRP are eligible for CFO 
payment. The provisions for determining eligibility for payment and the 
calculation of payment under CFO will be similar to those specified for 
the eligible conservation practices under CRP, EQIP, or cost-share 
agreements under WRP. For land retirement payments, the CRP payment 
schedule in effect for the applicable soils at the time the CFO contract 
is signed will be utilized. CCC will provide annual payments to a 
participant for such conservation practices as specified in the time 
schedule set forth in the conservation farm plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.6  Practice eligibility provisions.

    (a) Practices may be eligible for payment under CFO if the 
conservation practice specified in the conservation farm plan is 
determined to be an eligible practice, as determined by the Chief, in 
accordance with:
    (1) 7 CFR part 1410 for land retirement rental payments and 
practices that are eligible under CRP;
    (2) 7 CFR part 1467 for wetland restoration or protection practices 
that are eligible under WRP; or
    (3) 7 CFR part 1466 for conservation practices that are eligible 
under EQIP.
    (b) For practices that are installed on retired land, the CRP cost-
share rate for practices must be utilized.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.7  Participant eligibility provisions.

    Participants in the CFO must at the time of enrollment:
    (a) Have a production flexibility contract in accordance with part 
1412 of this chapter on the farm enrolling in CFO.
    (b) Agree to forgo earning future payments under the Conservation 
Reserve Program authorized by part 1410 of this chapter, the Wetlands 
Reserve Program cost-share payments authorized by part 1467 of this 
chapter, and Environmental Quality Incentives Program authorized by part 
1466 of this chapter, on the farm enrolled in the CFO for the term of 
the CFO contract.
    (c) Be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland 
conservation provisions found at part 12 of this title;
    (d) Have control of the land for the term of the proposed contract

    (c) 7 CFR part 1466, if the practice was determined an eligible 
conservation practice similar to EQIP in accordance with Sec. 
1468.6(c).


<R05>
Sec. 1468.9  Conservation farm plan.

    (a) The conservation farm plan forms the basis of the CFO contract. 
Prior to contract approval, a conservation farm plan must be written and 
approved. In deciding whether to approve a conservation farm plan, CCC 
may consider whether:
    (1) The participant will use conservation practices to solve the 
natural resource concerns that will maximize environmental benefits per 
dollar expended, and
    (2) The conservation practice would have been eligible for 
enrollment in the CRP, EQIP, or under the WRP cost-share agreements.
    (b) The conservation farm plan for the farm or ranch unit of concern 
shall:
    (1) Describe any resource conserving crop rotation, and all other 
conservation practices, to be implemented and maintained on the acreage 
that is subject to contract during the contact period;
    (2) Address the resource concerns identified in the CFO pilot 
project area proposal;
    (3) Contain a schedule for the implementation and maintenance of the 
practices described in the conservation farm plan;
    (4) Ensure that net environmental benefits under a CRP contract are 
maintained or exceeded for the whole farm, as constituted by FSA, when 
terminating a CRP contract and enrolling in a CFO contract; and
    (5) Meet the objectives of the pilot project area.
    (c) The conservation farm plan is part of the CFO contract.
    (d) The conservation farm plan must allow the participant to achieve 
a cost-effective resource management system, or some appropriate portion 
of that system, identified in the applicable NRCS field office technical 
guide or as approved by the State Conservationist.
    (e) Participants are responsible for implementing the conservation 
farm plan in compliance with this part.
    (f) Upon a participant's request, the NRCS may provide technical 
assistance to a participant.
    (1) Participants may, at their own cost, use qualified 
professionals, other than NRCS personnel, to provide technical 
assistance. NRCS retains approval authority over the technical adequacy 
of work done by non-NRCS personnel for the purpose of determining CFO 
contract compliance.
    (2) Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel 
not affiliated with NRCS may include, but not limited to: conservation 
planning; conservation practice survey, layout, design, and 
installation; information, education, and training for producers; and 
training and quality assurance for professional conservationists.
    (g) All conservation practices scheduled in the conservation farm 
plan are to be carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS Field 
Office Technical Guide. The State Conservationist may approve use of 
innovative conservation measures that are not contained in the NRCS 
Field Office Technical Guide.
    (h)(1) To simplify the conservation planning process for the 
participant, the conservation farm plan may be developed, at the request 
of the participant, as a single plan that incorporates, other Federal, 
state, Tribal, or local government program or regulatory requirements. 
CCC development or approval of a conservation farm plan shall not 
constitute compliance with program, statutory and regulatory 
requirements administered or enforced by a non-USDA agency, except as 
agreed to by the participant and the relevant Federal, state, local or 
tribal entities.

[[Page 675]]

    (2) CCC may accept an existing conservation plan developed and 
required for participation in any other CCC or USDA program if the 
conservation plan otherwise meets the requirements of this part. When a 
participant develops a single conservation farm plan for more than one 
program, the participant shall clearly identify the portions of the plan 
that are applicable to the CFO contract. It is the responsibility of the 
participant to ascertain and comply with all applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 1468.20  Application for CFO program participation.

    (a) Any eligible owner or producer within an approved pilot project 
area may submit an application for participation in the CFO to a service 
center or other USDA county or field office(s) of FSA or NRCS, where the 
pilot project area is located.
    (b) CCC will accept applications throughout the fiscal year. CCC 
will rank and select the offers of applicants periodically, as 
determined appropriate by the State Conservationist. The application 
period will begin after a pilot project area has been approved.
    (c) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the local 
work group, will develop ranking criteria to prioritize applications 
within a pilot project area which consists of more than one owner or 
producer. NRCS will prioritize applications from the same pilot project 
area using the criteria specific to the area. The FSA county committee, 
with the assistance of the designated conservationist and designated FSA 
official, will approve for funding the application in a pilot project 
area based on eligibility factors of the applicant and the NRCS ranking.
    (d) The designated conservationist will work with the applicant to 
collect the information necessary to evaluate the application using the 
ranking criteria. An applicant has the option of offering and accepting 
less than the maximum program payments allowed, offering to apply more 
conservation practices to the land in order to increase the likelihood 
of being enrolled. In evaluating the applications, the designated 
conservationist will take into consideration the following factors:
    (1) Soil erosion;
    (2) Water quality;
    (3) Wildlife benefits;
    (4) Soil productivity;
    (5) Conservation compliance considerations;
    (6) Likelihood to remain in conserving uses beyond the contract 
period, including tree planting and permanent wildlife habitat;
    (7) State water quality priority areas;
    (8) The environmental benefits per dollar expended; and
    (9) The degree to which application is consistent with the pilot 
project proposal.
    (e) If two or more applications have an equal rank, the application 
that will result in the least cost to the program will be given greater 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.21  Contract requirements.

    (a) In order for an applicant to receive annual payments, the 
applicant must enter into a contract agreeing to implement a 
conservation farm plan. The FSA county committee, with NRCS concurrence, 
will use the NRCS ranking consistent with the provisions of Sec. 
1468.20 and grant final approval of the contract.
    (b) A CFO contract will:
    (1) Incorporate by reference all portions of a conservation farm 
plan applicable to CFO;
    (2) Be for a duration of 10 years, and may be renewed, subject to 
the availability of funds, for a period not to exceed 5 years upon 
mutual agreement of CCC and the participant;
    (3) Provide that the participant will:
    (i) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch unit of concern 
consistent with the goals of the contract that would tend to defeat the 
purposes of the contract, or reduce net environmental and societal 
benefits;
    (ii) Refund with interest any program payments received and forfeit 
any future payments under the program, on the violation of a term or 
condition of the contract, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
1468.25 of this part;
    (iii) Refund all program payments received on the transfer of the 
right and interest of the producer in land subject

to the contract, unless the transferee of the right and interest agrees 
to assume all obligations of the contract, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1468.24 of this part;
    (iv) Agree to forego participation in CRP, EQIP, and the cost-share 
agreements under WRP, along with future payments associated with these 
programs, with regard to the land under the CFO contract;
    (v) Supply information as required by CCC to determine compliance 
with the contract and requirements of the program;
    (4) Specify the participant's requirements for operation and 
maintenance of the applied conservation practices in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1468.22 of this part, and
    (5) Include any other provision determined necessary or appropriate 
by CCC.
    (c) There is a limit of one CFO contract at any one time for each 
farm, as constituted by FSA.
    (d) The contract will incorporate the operation and maintenance of 
conservation practices applied under the contract, including those 
practices transferred from terminated CRP and EQIP contracts and WRP 
cost-share agreements. For persons wishing to transfer from CRP, EQIP, 
or WRP to CFO, practices included in CRP or EQIP contracts or WRP cost-
share agreements must be included in a CFO contract if an owner or 
producer wishes to participate, unless otherwise stated in the 
conservation farm plan.
    (e) Acreage that is subject to a WRP easement will not be included 
in the CFO contract.
    (f) Upon completion, the participant must certify that a 
conservation practice is completed in accordance with the conservation 
farm plan to establish compliance with the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.22  Conservation practice operation and maintenance.

    (a) The participant will operate and maintain the conservation 
practice for its intended purpose for the life span of the conservation 
practice, as identified in the conservation farm plan. Conservation 
practices installed before the execution of a CFO contract, but needed 
in the contract to obtain the environmental benefits agreed upon, are to 
be operated and maintained as specified in the contract. NRCS may 
periodically inspect the conservation practice during the lifespan of 
the practice as specified in the contract to ensure that the operation 
and maintenance is occurring.
    (b) For those persons who are signatories to existing CRP or EQIP 
contracts, or WRP cost-share agreements, practices will be transferred 
from EQIP and CRP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements, as agreed upon 
in the CFO conservation farm plan and CFO contract. Remaining rights and 
obligations under CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be incorporated into the new 
CFO contract. Practices included in CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be 
incorporated into the new CFO contract. Practices included in CRP or 
EQIP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements must be included in a CFO 
contract if an owner or producer wishes to participate. Participants in 
CFO with CRP, EQIP, or WRP practices incorporated into CFO contracts are 
responsible for operating and maintaining these practices for the 
balance of the period specified in the original program contract, unless 
otherwise stated in the conservation farm plan and CFO contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.23  Annual payments.

    (a) CCC will determine annual payments, subject to the availability 
of funds, based on the value of the expected payments that would have 
been paid to the participant for that practice as specified in:
    (1) Part 1410 of this chapter, if the practice is a land retirement 
rental payment or cost-share practice which would have qualified for 
payment under CRP in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(a);
    (2) Part 1467 of this chapter, if the practice is a wetland 
restoration or protection practice which would have qualified for 
payment under WRP which was determined eligible in accordance with Sec. 
1468.6(b);
    (3) Part 1466 of this chapter, if the practice was a conservation 
practice which would have qualified for payment under EQIP which was 
determined eligible in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(c);

[[Page 677]]

    (b) The maximum amount of annual payments which a person may receive 
under the CFO for any fiscal year shall not exceed the total of the 
amounts calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section 
after being limited as follows:
    (1) The payment calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section is limited in accordance with CRP payment limitation 
provisions set forth in part 1410 of this chapter.
    (2) The payment calculated in accordance with Sec. 1467.9(a)(2) of 
this chapter is not limited.
    (3) The payment calculated in accordance with Sec. 1466.23(a)(3) of 
this chapter is limited in accordance with EQIP payment limitation 
provisions in Sec. 1466.23(b) of this chapter.
    (c) The regulations set forth at part 1400 of this chapter will be 
applicable in making payment eligibility determinations for CFO and in

determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The CCC cost-share payments to a participant shall be reduced so 
that total financial contributions for a structural or vegetative 
practice from all public and private entity sources do not exceed the 
cost of the practice.
    (e) A landowner or producer that enrolls in CFO and terminates a CRP 
or EQIP contract or WRP cost-share agreement will be eligible to receive 
payments for practices which have been determined, established, or 
completed by the technical agency under those contracts or agreements. 
Once the CFO contract is effective, all payments for practices, 
including any practice transferred from the terminated contract 
agreement will be made under the CFO contract, except for payments 
already earned under prior contracts or cost-share agreements.
    (f) Payments will not be made to a participant who has applied or 
initiated the application of a conservation practice for the purposes of 
CFO prior to approval of the CFO contract.
    (g) When requested by the State Conservationist on a case-by-case 
basis, the Chief may approve, based upon availability of funding, cost 
share on the reapplication of a practice to replace or repair practice 
destroyed by unusual circumstances beyond the control of the landowner.
    (h) The participant and NRCS must certify that a conservation 
practice is completed in accordance with the conservation farm plan to 
establish compliance with the contract before the CCC will approve the 
payment of any cost-share, incentive, or land retirement payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.24  Contract modifications and transfers of land.

    (a) The participant and CCC may modify a contract if the participant 
and CCC agree to the contract modification and the conservation farm 
plan is revised in accordance with CCC requirements and is approved by 
the conservation district.
    (b) The participant may agree to transfer a contract to another 
eligible owner or operator with the agreement of CCC. The transferee 
shall assume full responsibility under the contract, including operation 
and maintenance of those conservation practices already installed and to 
be installed as a condition of the contract. By agreeing to participate 
in CFO, CCC may require operation and maintenance of those conservation 
practices installed under CRP, EQIP, or WRP.
    (c) CCC may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any 
assistance earned under a CRP or EQIP contract, or WRP cost-share 
agreement that was terminated as a condition of participation in CFO, if 
the participant sells or loses control of the land under a CFO contract 
and the new owner or controller does not assume responsibility under the 
contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.25  Contract violations and termination.

    (a)(1) If it is determined that a participant is in violation of the 
provisions of this part, or the terms of the contract including portions 
of the contract that incorporate transferred obligations from CRP or 
EQIP contracts, or WRP cost-share agreements, CCC will give the 
participant written notice of a reasonable time to correct the violation 
and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto,

[[Page 678]]

as determined by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS. If 
a participant continues in violation after the time to comply has 
elapsed, the FSA county committee may, in consultation with NRCS, 
terminate the CFO contract.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a contract termination shall be effective immediately upon a 
determination by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS, 
that the participant has submitted false information, filed a false 
claim, or engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for 
payments is permitted under the provisions of Sec. 1468.35 of this 
part, or in a case in which the actions of the party involved are deemed 
to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination 
without delay.
    (b)(1) If CCC terminates a contract, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for future payments under the contract and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received, plus interest, determined in 
accordance with part 1403 of this chapter. CCC has the option of 
requiring only partial refund of the payments received if a previously 
installed conservation practice can function independently, is not 
affected by the violation or other conservation practices that would 
have been installed under the contract, and the participant agrees to 
operate and maintain the installed conservation practice for the life 
span of the practice.
    (2) If CCC terminates a contract for any reason stated above, before 
any contractual payments have been made, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for further payments under the contract and shall pay such 
liquidated damages as are prescribed in the contract.
    (3) When making all contract termination decisions, CCC may reduce 
the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which 
reflects the good-faith effort of the participant to comply with the 
contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have 
prevented compliance with the contract.
    (4) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract without 
penalty, if CCC determines that such termination would be in the public 
interest.

<R05>
Sec. 1469.3  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this part and all documents 
issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:
    Activity means an action other than a conservation practice that is 
included as a part of a conservation stewardship contract; such as a 
measure, incremental movement on a conservation index or scale, or an

    Agricultural land means cropland, rangeland, pastureland, hayland, 
private non-industrial forest land if it is an incidental part of the 
agricultural operation, and other land on which food, fiber, and other 
agricultural products are produced. Areas used for strip-cropping or 
alley-cropping and silvopasture practices will be included as 
agricultural land.
    Agricultural operation means all agricultural land and other lands 
determined by the Chief, whether contiguous or noncontiguous, under the 
control of the participant and constituting a cohesive management unit, 
that is operated with equipment, labor, accounting system, and 
management that is substantially separate from any other. The minimum 
size of an agricultural operation is a field.
    Applicant means a producer as defined in this rule who has requested 
in writing to participate in CSP.
    Beginning farmer or rancher means an individual or entity who:
    (1) Has not operated a farm or ranch, or who has operated a farm or

1991(a)). This requirement applies to all members of an entity; and
    (2) Will materially and substantially participate in the operation 
of the farm or ranch.
    (i) In the case of a contract with an individual, solely, or with 
the immediate family, material and substantial participation requires 
that the individual provide substantial day-to-day labor and management 
of the farm or ranch, consistent with the practices in the county or 
State where the farm is located.
    (ii) In the case of a contract with an entity, all members must 
materially

[[Page 681]]

and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or ranch. 
Material and substantial participation requires that each of the members 
provide some amount of the management, or labor and management necessary 
for day-to-day activities, such that if each of the members did not 
provide these inputs, operation of the farm or ranch would be seriously 
impaired.
    Benchmark condition inventory means the documentation of the 
resource condition or situation pursuant to Sec. 1469.7(a) that NRCS 
uses to measure an applicant's existing level of conservation activities 
in order to determine program eligibility, to design a conservation 
stewardship contract, and to measure the change in resource conditions 
resulting from conservation treatment.
    Certified Conservation Planner means an individual certified by NRCS 
who possesses the necessary skills, training, and experience to 
implement the NRCS nine-step planning process to meet client objectives 
in solving natural resource problems. The certified conservation planner 
has demonstrated skill in assisting producers to identify resource 
problems, to express the client's objectives, to propose feasible 
solutions to resource problems, and assists the producers select and 
implement an effective alternative that treats resource concerns and 
consistent with client's objectives.
    Chief means the Chief of NRCS, USDA or designee.
    Conservation district means any district or unit of State or local 
government formed under State, territorial, or tribal law for the 
express purpose of developing and carrying out a local soil and water 
conservation program. Such a district or unit of government may be 
referred to as a ``conservation district,'' ``soil conservation 
district,'' ``soil and water conservation district,'' ``resource 
conservation district,'' ``land conservation committee,'' or similar 
name.

    Conservation stewardship contract means a legal document that 
specifies the rights and obligations of any participant who has been 
accepted to receive assistance through participation in CSP.
    Conservation stewardship plan means the conservation planning 
document that builds on the inventory of the benchmark condition 
documenting the conservation practices currently being applied; those 
practices needing to be maintained; and those practices, treatments, or 
activities to be supported under the provisions of the conservation 
stewardship contract.
    Conservation system means a combination of conservation practices, 
measures and treatments for the treatment of soil, water, air, plant, or 
animal resource concerns.
    Conservation treatment means any and all conservation practices, 
measures, and works of improvement that have the purpose of alleviating 
resource concerns, solving or reducing the severity of natural resource 
use problems, or taking advantage of resource opportunities.
    Considered to be planted means a long term rotation of alfalfa or 
multi-year grasses and legumes; summer fallow; typically cropped wet 
areas, such as rice fields, rotated to wildlife habitat; or crops 
planted to provide an adequate seedbed for re-seeding.
    Cropland means a land cover/use category that includes areas used 
for the production of adapted crops for harvest, including but not 
limited to land in row crops or close-grown crops, forage crops that are 
in a rotation with row or close-grown crops, permanent hayland, 
horticultural cropland, orchards, and vineyards.
    Designated conservationist means an NRCS employee whom the State 
Conservationist has designated as responsible for administration of CSP 
in a specific area.
    Enhancement payment means CSP payments available to all tiers as 
described in Sec. 1469.23(d).

[[Page 682]]

category mechanism will create distinct classes for funding defined by 
resource concerns, levels of treatment, and willingness to achieve 
additional environmental performance.
    Existing practice component of CSP payments means the component of a 
CSP payment as described in Sec. 1469.23(b).
    Field means a part of an agricultural operation which is separated 
from the balance of the agricultural operation by permanent boundaries, 
such as fences, permanent waterways, woodlands, and crop lines in cases 
where farming practices make it probable that such cropline is not 
subject to change, or other similar features.
    Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) means the official local NRCS 
source of resource information and the interpretations of guidelines, 
criteria, and standards for planning and applying conservation 
treatments and conservation management systems. It contains detailed 
information on the conservation of soil, water, air, plant, and animal 
resources applicable to the local area for which it is prepared. Guides 
can be reviewed at the local USDA Service Center or online at http://
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
    Forage and animal balance means that the total amount of available 
grazing forage and the addition of any roughage supply (hay, silage, or 
green chop) is balanced with the amount consumed by the total number of 
livestock and wildlife to meet their daily consumption needs.
    Forest land means a land cover/use category that is at least 10 
percent stocked by single-stemmed woody species of any size that will be 
at least 4 meters (13 feet) tall at maturity. Also included is land 
bearing evidence of natural regeneration of tree cover (cut over forest 
or abandoned farmland) that is not currently developed for nonforest 
use. Ten percent stocked, when viewed from a vertical direction, equates 
to an aerial canopy cover of leaves and branches of 25 percent or 
greater. The minimum area for classification as forest land is 1 acre, 
and the area must be at least 100 feet wide.
    Incidental forest land means forested land that includes all 
nonlinear forested riparian areas (i.e., bottomland forests), and small 
associated woodlots located within the bounds of working agricultural 
land or small adjacent areas and that are managed to maximize wildlife 
habitat values and are within the NRCS FOTG standards for a wildlife 
practice. However, silvopasture that meets NRCS practice standard will 
be considered as pasture or range land and not incidental forestland 
since silvopasture is one type of intense grazing system. Areas of 
incidental forest land that are not part of a linear conservation 
practice are limited individually in size to 10 acres or less and 
limited to 10 percent in congregate of the total offered acres.
    Indian tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, Nation, or other 
organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or

similar business arrangement as defined in 7 CFR 718.2.
    Land cover/use means a term that includes categories of land cover 
and categories of land use. Land cover is the vegetation or other kind 
of material that covers the land surface. Land use is the purpose of 
human activity on the land; it is usually, but not always, related to 
land cover. The National Resources Inventory uses the term land cover/
use to identify categories that account for all the surface area of the 
United States.
    Land management practice means conservation practices that primarily 
use site-specific management techniques and methods to conserve, protect 
from degradation, or improve soil, water, air, or related natural

not limited to, nutrient management, manure management, integrated pest 
management, integrated crop management, resource conserving crop 
rotations, irrigation water management, tillage or residue management, 
stripcropping, contour farming, grazing management, and wildlife habitat 
management.
    Limited resource producer means a producer:
    (1) With direct or indirect gross farm sales not more than $100,000

National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS); and
    (2) Who has a total household income at or below the national 
poverty level for a family of four, or less than 50 percent of county 
median household income in each of the previous 2 years (to be 
determined annually using Commerce Department Data).
    Liquidated damages means a sum of money stipulated in the CSP 
contract which the participant agrees to pay NRCS if the participant 
fails to adequately complete the contract. The sum represents an 
estimate of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the failure, and 
reflects the difficulties of proof of loss and the inconvenience or non-
feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.
    Local work group means representatives of local offices of FSA, the 
Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, the 
conservation district, and other Federal, State, and local government 
agencies, including Tribes, with expertise in natural resources who 
advise NRCS on decisions related to implementation of USDA conservation 
programs.
    Maintenance means work performed by the participant to keep the 
applied conservation practice functioning for the intended purpose 
during its life span. Maintenance includes work to prevent deterioration 
of the practice, repairing damage, or replacement of the practice to its 
original condition if one or more components fail.
    Management intensity means the degree and scope of practices or 
measures taken by a producer which are beyond the quality criteria for a 
given resource concern or beyond the minimum requirements of a 
management practice, and which may qualify as additional effort 
necessary to receive an enhancement payment.

conservation practice, but has the effect of alleviating problems or 
improving the treatment of the resources.
    Minimum level of treatment means the specific conservation treatment 
NRCS requires that addresses a resource concern to a level that meets or 
exceeds the quality criteria according to NRCS technical guides or the 
minimum tier requirements to address resource concerns as defined in 
1469.5(e).

a CSP contract.
    Pastured cropland means a land cover/use category that includes 
areas used for the production of pasture in grass-based livestock 
production systems that could support adapted crops for harvest, 
including but not limited to land in row crops or close-grown crops, and 
forage crops that are in a rotation with row or close-grown crops. 
Pastured cropland will receive the same stewardship payment as cropland.
    Pastureland means a land cover/use category of land managed 
primarily for the production of introduced forage plants for grazing 
animals and includes improved pasture. Pastureland cover may consist of 
a single species in a pure stand, a grass mixture, or a grass-legume 
mixture. Management usually consists of cultural treatments: 
fertilization, weed control, reseeding or renovation, and control of 
grazing.
    Practice life span means the time period in which the conservation 
practices are to be used and maintained for

[[Page 684]]

their intended purposes as defined by NRCS technical references.
    Priority resource concern means nationally significant resource 
concerns and local resource concerns, approved by the Chief, for which

a farm (or would have shared had the crop or livestock been produced).
    Quality criteria means the minimally acceptable level of treatment 
as defined in the technical guide of NRCS, required to achieve a 
resource management system for identified resource considerations for a 
particular land use.
    Rangeland means a land cover/use category on which the climax or 
potential plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, 
grasslike plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing, 
and introduced forage species that are managed like rangeland. This term 
would include areas where introduced hardy and persistent grasses, such 
as crested wheatgrass, are planted and such practices as deferred 
grazing, burning, chaining, and rotational grazing are used, with little 
or no chemicals or fertilizer being applied. Grasslands, savannas, 
prairie, many wetlands, some deserts, and tundra are considered to be 
rangeland. Certain communities of low forbs and shrubs, such as 
mesquite, chaparral, mountain shrub, and pinyon-juniper, are also 
included as rangeland.
    Resource concern means the condition of natural resources that may 
be sensitive to change by natural forces or human activity. Resource 
concerns include the resource considerations listed in Section III of 
the FOTG, such as soil erosion, soil condition, soil deposition, water 
quality, water quantity, animal habitat, air quality, air condition, 
plant suitability, plant condition, plant management, and animal habitat 
and management.
    Resource-conserving crop rotation means a crop rotation that reduces 
erosion, maintains or improves soil fertility and tilth, interrupts pest 
cycles, or conserves soil moisture and water and that includes at least 
one resource-conserving crop, such as a perennial grass, a legume grown 
for use as forage, seed for planting, or green manure, a legume-grass 
mixture, a small grain grown in combination with a grass or legume, 
whether inter-seeded or planted in rotation.
    Resource management system means a system of conservation practices

the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    Sharecropper means an individual who performs work in connection 
with the production of the crop under the supervision of the operator 
and who receives a share of such crop in return for the provision of 
such labor.

provides to describe the particular requirements for a specific CSP 
sign-up.
    Significant resource concerns means the list of resource concerns, 
identified by NRCS, associated with an agricultural operation that is 
subject to applicable requirements under CSP, such as the additional 
Tier II contract requirement.
    Soil quality means resource concerns and/or opportunities related to 
depletion of soil organic matter content through soil disturbance or by 
sheet, rill, and wind erosion, and the physical condition of the soil 
relative to ease of tillage, fitness as a seedbed, the impedance to 
seedling emergence or root penetration, salinity, and overall soil 
productivity.
    State Conservationist means the NRCS employee authorized to direct 
and supervise NRCS activities within a specified State, the Pacific 
Basin, or the Caribbean Area.
    State Technical Committee means a committee established by the

of treatment as specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section 
on part of the agricultural operation. Only the acreage meeting such 
requirements is eligible for stewardship and existing practice payments 
in CSP.

[[Page 687]]

    (ii) An applicant is eligible to participate in CSP Tier II only if 
the benchmark condition inventory demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
NRCS that the applicant has addressed the nationally significant 
resource concerns of water quality and soil quality to the minimum level 
of treatment as specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section 
for all land uses on the entire agricultural operation. Under Tier II, 
the entire agricultural operation must be enrolled in CSP.
    (iii) An applicant is eligible to participate in CSP Tier III only 
if the benchmark condition inventory demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
NRCS that the applicant has addressed all of the applicable resource 
concerns to the minimum level of treatment as specified in paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section on the entire agricultural operation. Practices 
or activities shall not be required for participation in the program 
unless they would have an ultimate conservation benefit as demonstrated 
by the Conservation Practice Physical Effects matrix in the FOTG. Under 
Tier III, the entire agricultural operation is enrolled in CSP including 
other land as defined in Sec. 1469.5(d)(1)(v).
    (2) The minimum level of treatment on cropland for Tier I and Tier 
II:
    (i) The minimum level of treatment for soil quality on cropland is 
considered achieved when the Soil Conditioning Index value is positive;
    (ii) The minimum level of treatment for water quality on cropland is 
considered achieved if the benchmark inventory indicates that the 
current level of treatment meets or exceeds the quality criteria 
according to the NRCS technical guides for these specific resource 
considerations: nutrients, pesticides, salinity and sediment for surface 
waters and nutrients, pesticides, and salinity for groundwater.
    (3) The minimum level of treatment on pastureland and rangelands for 
Tier I and Tier II is vegetation and animal management accomplished by 
following a grazing management plan that provides a forage-animal 
balance, proper livestock distribution, and timing of use and managing 
livestock access to water courses.
    (4) The minimum level of treatment for Tier III.
    (i) The minimum level of treatment for Tier III is meeting the 
quality criteria for the local NRCS FOTG for all existing resource 
concerns and considerations with the following exceptions:
    (A) The minimum requirement for soil quality on cropland is 
considered achieved when the Soil Conditioning Index value is positive; 
and
    (B) The minimum requirement for water quantity--irrigation water 
management on cropland or pastureland is considered achieved when the 
current level of treatment and management for the system results in a 
water use efficiency value of at least 50%.
    (C) The minimum requirement for wildlife is considered achieved when 
the current level of treatment and management for the system results in 
a value of at least 0.5.
    (5) In the instance of a significant natural event, such as drought, 
wildfire, pestilence, or flooding which would prevent the participant or 
applicant from achieving the minimum requirements, those requirements 
will be considered met so long as the participant or applicant can 
provide documentation of their stewardship prior to such an event.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.6  Enrollment criteria and selection process.

    (a) Selection and funding of priority watersheds. (1) NRCS will 
prioritize watersheds based on a nationally consistent process using 
existing natural resource, environmental quality, and agricultural 
activity data along with other information that may be necessary to 
efficiently operate the program. The watershed prioritization and 
identification process will consider several factors, including but not 
limited to:
    (i) Potential of surface and ground water quality to degradation;
    (ii) Potential of soil to degradation;
    (iii) Potential of grazing land to degradation;
    (iv) State or national conservation and environmental issues e.g. 
location of air non-attainment zones or important wildlife/fisheries 
habitat; and
    (v) Local availability of management tools needed to more 
efficiently operate the program, such as digital soils information.

[[Page 688]]

    (2) Priority watersheds selected, in which producers would be 
potentially eligible for enrollment, will be announced in the sign-up 
notice.
    (b) Enrollment categories. The Chief may limit new program 
enrollments in any fiscal year to enrollment categories designed to 
focus on priority conservation concerns and enhancement measures. NRCS 
will utilize enrollment categories to determine which contracts will be 
funded in a given sign-up.
    (1) Enrollment categories will be defined by criteria related to 
resource concerns and levels of historic conservation treatment, and the 
producer's willingness to achieve additional environmental performance 
or conduct enhancement activities.
    (2) All applications which meet the sign-up criteria within the 
priority watersheds will be placed in an enrollment category regardless 
of available funding.
    (3) NRCS will develop subcategories within each enrollment category 
and include them in the sign-up notice. The development of subcategories 
may consider several factors, including:
    (i) Willingness of the applicant to participate in local 
conservation enhancement activities;
    (ii) Targeting program participation for Limited Resource Producers;
    (iii) Targeting program participation to water quality priority 
areas for nutrient or pest management;
    (iv) Targeting program participation for locally important wildlife/
fisheries habitat creation and protection; and
    (v) Other priorities as determined by the Secretary.
    (4) At the beginning of each sign-up, the Chief will announce the 
order in which categories and subcategories are eligible to be funded.
    (5) All eligible applications will be placed in the highest priority 
enrollment category and sub-category for which the application 
qualifies.
    (6) Enrollment categories and subcategories will be funded in 
priority order until the available funds specified in the CSP sign-up 
notice are exhausted.
    (c) Sign-up process. (1) NRCS will publish a CSP sign-up notice with 
sufficient time for producers to consider the benefits of participation 
prior to the opening of the sign-up period. In the public sign-up 
notice, the Chief will announce and explain the rationale for decisions 
for the following information:
    (i) Any additional program eligibility criteria that are not listed 
in Sec. 1469.5;
    (ii) Any additional nationally significant resource concerns that 
are not listed in Sec. 1469.4(a) that will apply;
    (iii) Any additional requirements that participants must include in 
their CSP applications and contracts that are not listed in Sec. 
1469.21;
    (iv) Information on the priority order of enrollment categories and 
subcategories for funding contracts;
    (v) Specific information on the level of funding that NRCS estimates 
will go toward stewardship, existing practice, and enhancement payments;
    (vi) An estimate of the total funds NRCS expects to obligate under 
new contracts during a given sign-up, and an estimate for the number of 
enrollment categories and contracts NRCS expects to be able to fund; and
    (vii) The schedule for the sign-up process, including the 
deadline(s) for applying.
    (2) NRCS will accept applications according to the timeframes 
specified in the sign-up notice.
    (d) Selection of contracts. (1) NRCS will determine whether the 
application meets the eligibility criteria, and will place applications 
into an enrollment category based on the criteria specified in the sign-
up notice. Enrollment categories will be funded in the order designated 
in the sign-up notice until the available funding is exhausted. NRCS 
will determine the number of categories that can be funded in accordance 
with the sign-up notice, and will inform the applicant of its 
determinations. NRCS will determine in which Tier the participant is 
eligible to participate, and will notify applicants of the 
determination.
    (2) NRCS will develop a conservation stewardship contract for the 
selected applications. If the contract falls within the group of 
contracts funded in the given sign-up, NRCS will make payments as 
described in the contract in return for their implementation and/or

[[Page 689]]

maintenance of a specified level of conservation treatment on all or 
part of the agricultural operation.

for the portion being enrolled.
    (3) Any other requirements specified in the sign-up notice;
    (4) For Tier I, clear indication of which acres the applicant wishes 
to enroll in the CSP;
    (5) A certification that the applicant will agree to meet the 
relevant contract requirements outlined in the sign-up notice;
    (b) Producers who are members of a joint operation, trust, estate, 
association, partnership or similar organization must file a single 
application for the joint operation or organization.
    (c) Producers can submit only one application per sign-up.
    (d) Producers can only have one active contract at any one time.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.21  Contract requirements.

    (a) To receive payments, each participant must enter into a 
conservation stewardship contract and comply with its provisions. Among 
other things, the participant agrees to maintain at least

[[Page 691]]

the level of stewardship identified in the benchmark inventory for the 
portion being enrolled for the entire contract period, as appropriate, 
and implement and maintain any new practices or activities required in 
the contract.
    (b) Program participants will only receive payments from one 
conservation stewardship contract per agricultural operation.
    (c) CSP participants must address the following requirements or 
additional resource concerns to the minimum level of treatment by the 
end of their CSP contract:
    (1) Tier I contract requirement: additional practices and activities 
as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and 
approved by NRCS, over the part of the agricultural operation enrolled 
in CSP.
    (2) Tier II contract requirement: additional practices and 
activities including the treatment of an additional locally significant 
resource concern as described in Section III of the NRCS FOTG other than 
the nationally significant resource concerns, as included by the 
applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and approved by NRCS, 
over the entire agricultural operation, where applicable.
    (3) Tier III contract requirement: additional practices and 
activities as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship 
plan and approved by NRCS, over the entire agricultural operation, where 
applicable.
    (d) Transition to a higher tier of participation.
    (1) Upon agreement by NRCS and the participant, a conservation 
stewardship contract may include provisions that lead to a higher tier 
of participation during the contract period. Such a transition does not 
require a contract modification if that transition is laid out in the 
schedule of contract activities. In the event that such a transition 
begins with Tier I, only the land area in the agricultural operation 
that meets the requirements for enrollment in Tier I can be enrolled in 
the contract until the transition occurs. Upon transition from Tier I to 
a higher tier of participation, the entire agricultural operation must 
be incorporated into the contract. All requirements applicable to the 
higher tier of participation would then apply. NRCS will calculate all 
stewardship, existing practice, new practice payments, and enhancement 
payments using the applicable enrolled acreage at the time of the 
payment.
    (2) A contract in which a participant transitions to higher tier(s) 
of participation must include:
    (i) A schedule for the activities associated with the transition(s);
    (ii) A date certain by which time the transition(s) must occur; and,
    (iii) A specification that the CSP payment will be based on the 
current Tier of participation, which may change over the life of the 
contract.
    (3) A contract in which a participant transitions from Tier I to a 
higher tier will not authorize higher payments for that transition until 
the participant has demonstrated that they have achieved that tier level 
for a period of at least 12 months.
    (4) A contract in which a participant transitions from Tier II to 
Tier III must include a participation period of no less than 12 months 
at Tier II.
    (5) The transition contract will retain the original contract 
length.
    (e) A conservation stewardship contract must:
    (1) Incorporate by reference the conservation stewardship plan;
    (2) Be for 5 years for Tier I, and 5 to 10 years for Tier II or Tier 
III;
    (3) Incorporate all provisions as required by law or statute, 
including participant requirements to:
    (i) Implement and maintain the practices as identified and scheduled 
in the conservation stewardship plan, including those needed to be 
eligible for the specified tier of participation and comply with any 
additional sign-up requirements;
    (ii) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch that tend to 
defeat the purposes of the contract;
    (iii) Refund any CSP payments received with interest and liquidated 
damages, and forfeit any future payments under CSP, if the participant 
fails to correct a violation of a term or contract within 30 days of 
written notice of such by the NRCS, or upon a second violation of a term 
or condition of the contract;

[[Page 692]]

    (iv) Supply records and information as required by CCC to determine 
compliance with the contract and requirements of CSP.
    (4) Specify the participant's requirements for operation and 
maintenance of the applied conservation practices;
    (5) Specify the schedule of payments under the life of the contract, 
including how those payments:
    (i) Relate to the schedule for implementing additional conservation 
measures as described in the security plan;
    (ii) Relate to the participant's actual implementation of additional 
conservation measures as described in the security plan; and,
    (iii) May be adjusted by NRCS if the participant's management 
decisions change the appropriate set or schedule of conservation 
measures on the operation.
    (6) Incorporate any other provisions determined necessary or 
appropriate by NRCS, or included as a requirement for the sign-up.
    (f) The participant must apply and maintain the practice(s) within 
the timelines specified in the contract.
    (g) Contracts expire on September 30 in the last year of the 
contract. A participant may apply for a new conservation stewardship 
contract in a subsequent sign-up.
    (h) Participants must:
    (1) Implement the conservation stewardship contract approved by 
NRCS;
    (2) Make available to NRCS, appropriate records showing the timely 
implementation of the contract;
    (3) Comply with the regulations of this part; and
    (4) Not engage in any activity that interferes with the purposes of 
the program, as determined by NRCS.
    (i) NRCS will determine the payments under the contract as described 
in Sec. 1469.23.
    (j) NRCS will not pay participants for: practices within their 
conservation stewardship plan that are required to meet conservation 
compliance requirements found in 7 CFR part 12; practices that are 
included in maintenance agreements (with financial reimbursements for 
maintenance) that existed prior to the participant's conservation 
stewardship contract approval; or the maintenance of equipment.
    (k) For contracts encompassing the participant's entire agricultural 
operation, the geographic boundaries of the acreage enrolled in the 
contract must include all fields and facilities under the participant's 
direct control, as determined by NRCS.
    (l) An applicant will be awarded only one contract per sign-up 
period.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.22  Conservation practice operation and maintenance.

    (a) The contract will incorporate the operation and maintenance of 
the conservation practice(s) applied under the contract.
    (b) The participant must operate and maintain any new conservation 
practice(s) for which the participant has received a new practice or 
enhancement payment its intended purpose for the life span of the 
conservation practice(s), as identified in the contract or conservation 
stewardship plan, as determined by NRCS.
    (c) Conservation practices that are installed before the execution 
of a contract, but are needed in the contract to obtain the intended 
environmental benefits, must be operated and maintained as specified in 
the contract whether or not an existing practice payment is made.
    (d) NRCS may periodically inspect the conservation practices during 
the practice lifespan as specified in the contract to ensure that 
operation and maintenance are being carried out, and that the practice 
is fulfilling its intended objectives. When NRCS finds that a 
participant is not operating and maintaining practices installed through 
the CSP in an appropriate manner, NRCS will request a refund of any 
associated payments that NRCS made for that practice under the contract. 
If an existing practice is part of a system that meets the quality 
criteria, but does not technically meet NRCS minimum practice standards, 
the practice must be modified or updated to meet the standard according 
the FOTG as specified in Sec. 1469.25(a) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.23  Program payments.

    (a) Stewardship component of CSP payments.

[[Page 693]]

    (1) The conservation stewardship plan, as applicable, divides the 
land area to be enrolled in the CSP into land use categories, such as 
irrigated and non-irrigated cropland, irrigated and non-irrigated 
pasture, pastured cropland and range land, among other categories.
    (2) NRCS will determine an appropriate stewardship payment rate for 
each land use category using the following methodology:
    (i) NRCS will initially calculate the average 2001 rates using the 
Agriculture Foreign Investment Disclosure Act (AFIDA) Land Value Survey, 
the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) land rental data, and 
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) rental rates.
    (ii) Where typical rental rates for a given land use vary widely 
within a State or between adjacent States, NRCS will adjust the county-
level rates to ensure local and regional consistency and equity.
    (iii) The State Conservationists can also contribute additional 
local data, with advice from the State Technical Committee.
    (iv) The final stewardship payment rate will be the adjusted 
regional rates described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section multiplied by a reduction factor of 0.25 for Tier I, 0.50 for 
Tier II, and 0.75 for Tier III.
    (v) Pastured cropland will receive the same stewardship payment as 
cropland.
    (3) NRCS will compute the stewardship component of a participant's 
CSP payment as the product of: the number of acres in each land use 
category (not including ``other'' or land not in the applicant's 
control); the corresponding stewardship payment rate for the applicable 
acreage; and a tier-specific percentage. The tier-specific percentage is 
5 percent for Tier I payments, 10 percent for Tier II payments, and 15 
percent for Tier III payments.
    (4) Other incidental parcels as defined in Sec. 1469.5(d)(1)(iv) 
including incidental forest land may be given a stewardship rate as 
though they were the land use to which they are contiguous if they are 
serving a conservation purpose, such as wildlife habitat. Minimum 
treatment requirements for the contract tier apply.
    (5) Other land, as defined in Sec. 1469.5(d)(1)(v), is not included 
in the stewardship payment computation.
    (6) NRCS will publish the stewardship payment rates at the 
announcement of each program sign-up.
    (b) Existing practice component of CSP payments.
    (1) The Chief will determine and announce which practices will be 
eligible for existing practice payments in accordance with Sec. 
1469.8(a).
    (2) With exceptions including, but not limited to, paragraph (b)(3) 
and (4)of this section, NRCS may pay the participant a percentage of the 
average 2001 county cost of maintaining a land management, and 
structural practice that is documented in the benchmark condition 
inventory as existing upon enrollment in CSP. The Chief may offer 
alternative payment methods such as paying a percentage of the 
stewardship payment as long as the payment will not exceed 75 percent 
(or, in the case of a beginning farmer or rancher, 90 percent) of the 
average 2001 county costs of installing the practice in the 2001 crop 
year. NRCS will post the rates for for payment at the time of the sign-
up notices on the NRCS website and in USDA Service Centers.
    (3) NRCS will not pay participants for maintenance of equipment.
    (4) NRCS will not pay an existing practice component of CSP payments 
for any practice that is required to meet conservation compliance 
requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.
    (5) Existing practice payments are not intended to pay for routine 
maintenance activities related to production practices or practices 
considered typical in farm and ranch operations for a specific location.
    (6) Existing practice payments will be made only on practices that 
meet or exceed the practice standards described in the FOTG.
    (7) The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.
    (c) New practice payments. (1) The Chief will determine and announce 
which practices will be eligible for new practice payments in accordance 
with Sec. 1469.8(a).
    (2) If a participant's CSP contract requires the participant to 
implement a

[[Page 694]]

new structural, vegetative, or management practice, NRCS may pay the 
participant a percentage of the cost of installing the new practice. In 
no case will the payment exceed 50 percent of the average county costs 
of installing the practice (or a similar practice, if new) in the 2001 
crop year. NRCS will provide the list of approved practices and the 
percentage cost-share rate for each practice at the time of each CSP 
sign-up notice.
    (3) NRCS may not make new practice payments to participants for:
    (i) Construction or maintenance of animal waste storage or treatment 
facilities or associated waste transport or transfer devices for animal 
feeding operations;
    (ii) The purchase or maintenance of equipment; or
    (iii) A non-land based structure that is not integral to a land 
based practice, as determined by the Chief.
    (4) Participants may contribute to their share of the cost of 
installing a new practice through in-kind sources, such as personal 
labor, use of personal equipment, or donated materials. Contributions 
for a participant's share of the practice may also be provided from non-
Federal sources, as determined by the Chief.
    (5) Cost-share payments may be provided by other USDA programs; 
except that payments may not be provided through CSP and another program 
for the same practice on the same land area.
    (6) If additional practices are installed or implemented to advance 
a participant from one tier of participation to a higher tier, the 
practice must be certified by NRCS and be maintained prior to advancing 
to a higher tier as described in Sec. 1469.24(b).
    (7) In no instance will the total financial contributions for 
installing a practice from all public and private entity sources exceed 
100 percent of the actual cost of installing the practice.
    (8) NRCS will not pay a new practice payment for any practice that 
is required to meet a participant's conservation compliance plan 
requirements found in 7 CFR part 12.
    (9) The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.
    (d) Enhancement component of CSP payments. (1) The Chief will 
establish a list of conservation practices and activities that are 
eligible for enhancement payments for a given sign-up. State 
Conservationists, with advice from the State Technical Committees, will 
tailor the list to meet the needs of the selected watersheds and submit 
to the Chief for concurrence.
    (2) NRCS may pay an enhancement component of a CSP payment if a 
conservation stewardship plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of NRCS 
that the plan's activities will increase conservation performance 
including activities related to energy management as a result of 
additional effort by the participant and result in:
    (i) The improvement of a resource concern by implementing or 
maintaining multiple conservation practices or measures that exceed the 
minimum eligibility requirements for the participant's Tier of 
participation as outlined in the sign-up notice and as described in 
Sec. 1469.5(e) and the contract requirements in Sec. 1469.21; or
    (ii) An improvement in a local resource concern based on local 
priorities and in addition to the national significant resource 
concerns, as determined by NRCS.
    (3) NRCS may also pay an enhancement component of a CSP payment if a 
participant:
    (i) Participates in an on-farm conservation research, demonstration, 
or pilot project as outlined in the sign-up notice; or
    (ii) Cooperates with other producers to implement watershed or 
regional resource conservation plans that involve at least 75 percent of 
the producers in the targeted area; or
    (iii) Carries out assessment and evaluation activities relating to 
practices included in the conservation stewardship plan as outlined in 
the sign-up notice.
    (4) NRCS will not pay the enhancement component of a CSP payment for 
any practice that is required to meet a participant's conservation 
compliance plan requirements found in 7 CFR part 12.
    (5) Eligible enhancement payments. (i) State Conservationists, with 
advice from the State Technical Committees,

[[Page 695]]

will develop proposed enhancement payment amounts for each practice and 
activity.
    (ii) Enhancement payments will be determined based on a given 
activity's cost or expected net conservation benefits above the minimum 
criteria, and the payment amount will be an amount and at a rate 
necessary to encourage a participant to perform or continue a management 
practice or measure, resource assessment and evaluation project, or 
field-test a research, demonstration, or pilot project, that would not 
otherwise be initiated without government assistance.
    (iii) NRCS will provide the list of approved enhancement activities 
and payment amounts for each activity with the CSP sign-up notice.
    (6) The Chief may set a not-to-exceed limit for the enhancement 
payment in any given sign-up notice.
    (7) Enhancements above the minimum criteria for the resource concern 
that are included in the benchmark inventory may be included in the 
first CSP payment.
    (e) Contracts will be limited as follows:
    (1) $20,000 per year for a Tier I conservation stewardship contract, 
(2) $35,000 per year for a Tier II conservation stewardship contract, or
    (3) $45,000 per year for a Tier III conservation stewardship 
contract.
    (4) Stewardship components of CSP payments cannot exceed $5,000 per 
year for Tier I, $10,500 per year for Tier II, or $13,500 per year for 
Tier III.
    (5) The total of the stewardship, existing and enhancement payment 
cannot exceed a percentage of the unadjusted stewardship payment rate 
described in (a)(2)(i) through (iii). The tier-specific percentage is 15 
percent for Tier I contracts, 25 percent for Tier II contracts, and 40 
percent for Tier III contracts.
    (f) The new practice and enhancement components of the CSP contract 
payment may increase once the participant applies and maintains 
additional conservation practices and activities as described in the 
conservation stewardship plan
    (g) The Chief of NRCS may limit the stewardship, practice, and 
enhancement components of CSP payments in order to focus funding toward 
targeted activities and conservation benefits the Chief identifies in 
the sign-up notice and any subsequent addenda.
    (h) In the event that annual funding is insufficient to fund 
existing contract commitments, the existing contracts will be pro-rated 
in that contract year.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.24  Contract modifications and transfers of land.

    (a) Contracts may be modified:
    (1) At the request of the participant, if the modification is 
consistent with the purposes of the conservation security program, or;
    (2) As required by the State Conservationist due to changes to the 
type size, management, or other aspect of the agricultural operation 
that would interfere with achieving the purposes of the program. In lieu 
of modifying the contract--
    (i) The producer may terminate the contract; and,
    (ii) Retain payments received under the contract, if the participant 
has fully complied with the terms and conditions of the contract before 
the termination.
    (b) Participants may request a modification to their contract to 
change their tier of participation under a CSP contract once the 
measures determined necessary by NRCS to meet the next tier level have 
been established and maintained for a period of 12 months.
    (c) Contract transfers are permitted when there is agreement among 
all parties to the contract.
    (1) NRCS must be notified within 60 days of the transfer of interest 
or the contract will be terminated.
    (2) The transferee must be determined by NRCS to be eligible and 
must assume full responsibility under the contract, including operation 
and maintenance of those conservation practices and activities already 
undertaken and to be undertaken as a condition of the contract.
    (d) The Chief may require a participant to refund all or a portion 
of any assistance earned under CSP if the participant sells or loses 
control of the land under a CSP contract, and the new owner or 
controller is not eligible to participate in CSP, or refuses to assume 
responsibility under the contract

[[Page 696]]

within 60 days after the date of the transfer or change in the interest 
of the land and the participant has not fully complied with the terms 
and conditions of the contract to the extent that the purposes of the 
program have not been achieved.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.25  Contract violations and termination.

    (a) If the NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the 
terms of a contract, or documents incorporated by reference into the 
contract, NRCS will give the participant a reasonable time, as 
determined by the State Conservationist, to correct the violation and 
comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto. If a 
participant continues in violation, the State Conservationist may 
terminate the CSP contract.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
a contract termination is effective immediately upon a determination by 
the State Conservationist that the participant has: Submitted false 
information; filed a false claim; engaged in any act for which a finding 
of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part; or taken 
actions NRCS deems to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant 
a termination without delay.
    (c) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, the 
participant will forfeit all rights for future payments under the 
contract, and must refund all or part of the payments received, plus 
interest, and liquidated damages as determined in accordance with part 
1403 of this chapter. The State Conservationist may require only partial 
refund of the payments received if a previously installed conservation 
practice can function independently, is not affected by the violation or 
other conservation practices that would have been installed under the 
contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain the 
installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.
    (d) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, or the 
participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual 
payments have been made, the participant will forfeit all rights for 
further payments under the contract, and must pay such liquidated 
damages as are prescribed in the contract. The State Conservationist has 
the option to waive the liquidated damages, depending upon the 
circumstances of the case.
    (e) When making any contract termination decisions, the State 
Conservationist may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant 
by a proportion which reflects the good faith effort of the participant 
to comply with the contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's 
control that have prevented compliance with the contract including 
natural disasters or events.
    (f) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract, without 
penalty or repayment, if the State Conservationist determines that the 
producer has fully complied with the terms and conditions of the 
contract before termination of the contract.
    (g) In carrying out the role in this section, the State 
Conservationist may consult with the local conservation district.

of NRCS.

    If a participant relied upon the advice or action of any authorized 
representative of CCC, and did not know or have reason to know that the 
action or advice was improper or erroneous, the State Conservationist 
may accept the advice or action as meeting the requirements of CSP. In 
addition, the State Conservationist may grant relief, to the extent it 
is deemed desirable by CCC, to provide a fair and equitable treatment 
because of the good faith reliance on the part of the participant.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.35  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, NRCS will 
make any payment or portion thereof to any participant without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found at 7 CFR part 1403 are 
applicable to contract payments.
    (b) Any producer entitled to any payment may assign any payments in 
accordance with regulations governing assignment of payment found at 7 
CFR part 1404.


<R05>
Sec. 1469.36  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

with this part, are not entitled to contract payments and must refund to 
CCC all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with Sec. 
1469.25.
    (b) A producer who is determined to have knowingly:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
CSP;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a CSP determination, must 
refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1469.25 received by such producer with respect to all contracts.

Sec. 1480.4  Producer eligibility.

    (a) Producers in the United States will be eligible to receive 
disaster benefits under this part only if they have suffered losses of 
eligible crops in 2001 or 2002 as a result of a disaster or related 
condition, or as further specified in this part. Producers may not 
receive benefits with respect to volunteer stands of crops.
    (b) Payments may be made for losses suffered by an eligible producer 
who is now deceased or is a dissolved entity if a representative who 
currently has authority to enter into a contract for the producer signs 
the application for payment. Proof of authority to sign for the deceased 
producer or dissolved entity must be provided. If a producer is now a 
dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the 
general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their 
duly authorized representatives must sign the application for payment.
    (c) As a condition to receive benefits under this part, a producer 
must have been in compliance with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation 
and Wetland Conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12, for the 2001 or 
2002 crop year, as applicable, and must not otherwise be barred from 
receiving benefits under 7 CFR part 12 or any other law.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.5  Time for filing application.

    Applications for benefits under the 2001 or 2002-Crop Disaster 
Program must be filed in the county FSA office serving the county where 
the producer's farm is located for administrative purposes before the 
close of business on August 25, 2003, or such other later date that may 
be announced by the Deputy Administrator.

Sec. 1480.6  Limitations on payments and other benefits.

    (a) A producer may receive disaster benefits on either 2001 or 2002 
crop losses as specified under this part.
    (b) Payments will not be made under this part for grazing losses.
    (c) CCC may divide and classify crops based on loss susceptibility, 
yield, and other factors.
    (d) No person shall receive more than a total of $80,000 in disaster 
benefits under this part, unless otherwise specified.
    (e) No person shall receive disaster benefits under this part in an 
amount that exceeds 95 percent of the value of the expected production 
for the relevant period as determined by CCC. The sum of the value of 
the crop not lost if any; the disaster payment; and the net crop 
insurance indemnity, cannot exceed 95 percent of what the crop's value 
would have been if there had been no loss.
    (f) A person whose gross revenue is in excess of $2.5 million for 
the preceding tax year shall not be eligible to receive disaster 
benefits under this part. Gross revenue includes the total income and 
total gross receipts of the person, before any reductions. Gross revenue 
shall not be adjusted, amended, discounted, netted or modified for any 
reason. No deductions for costs, expenses, or pass through funds will be 
deducted from any calculation of gross revenue. For purposes of making 
this determination, gross revenue means the total gross receipts 
received from farming, ranching and forestry operations if the person 
receives more than 50 percent of such person's gross income from farming 
or ranching; or the total gross receipts received from all sources if 
the person receives 50 percent or less of such person's gross receipts 
from farming, ranching and forestry.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.7  Requirement to purchase crop insurance and non-insurable 
coverage.

    (a) Except as provided further in this section, any producer who 
elected not to purchase crop insurance on an insurable 2001 or 2002 crop 
for which the producer receives crop loss assistance or for non-
insurable crops, elected not to participate in NAP for the year for 
which benefits are received must:
    (1) Purchase crop insurance with additional coverage on that crop 
for the 2003 and 2004 crop years for the insurable crops.
    (2) NAP coverage by paying the administrative fee by the applicable 
State filing deadline and complete all required program requirements 
including yearly acreage reports, for the non-insurable crop for both 
2003 and 2004 crop years
    (b) If, at the time the producer applies for the 2001 or 2002 CDP 
the sales closing date for 2003 insurable crops, or for 2003 non-
insurable crops for which the producer sought benefits under the 2001 or 
2002 CDP has passed, the producer must purchase crop insurance policy or 
obtain NAP coverage, as applicable, for the next available 2 crops 
years.
    (c) If any producer fails to purchase crop insurance and/or NAP, as 
required in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the producer shall 
reimburse CCC for the full amount of the assistance, plus interest, 
provided to the producer under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.8  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) A person shall be ineligible to receive disaster assistance 
under this part if it is determined by the State or county committee or 
an official of FSA that such person has:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the 
purpose of a program operated under this part;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation with respect to such program; 
or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (b) All persons with a financial interest in the operation receiving 
benefits under this part shall be jointly and severally liable for any 
refund, including related charges, which is determined to be due CCC for 
any reason under this part.
    (c) In the event that any request for assistance or payment under 
this part was established as result of erroneous information or a 
miscalculation, the assistance or payment shall be recalculated and any 
excess refunded with applicable interest.

[[Page 717]]

    (d) The liability of any person for any penalty under this part or 
for any refund to CCC or related charge arising in connection therewith 
shall be in addition to any other liability of such person under any 
civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law including, 
but not limited to: 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001 and 1014; 15 
U.S.C. 714m; and 31 U.S.C. 3729.
    (e) Any person who is dissatisfied with a determination made with 
respect to this part may make a request for reconsideration or appeal of 
such determination in accordance with the regulations set forth in parts 
11 and 780 of this title.
    (f) Any payment or portion thereof to any person shall be made 
without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard 
to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof.
    (g) For the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 3201(e), CCC waives the 
restriction on receipt of funds or benefits under this program but only 
as to beneficiaries who as a condition of such waiver agree to apply the 
2001 or 2002 CDP benefits to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.9  Matters of general applicability.

    (a) For calculations of loss made with respect to insured crops, the 
producer's existing unit structure will be used as the basis for the 
calculation and may include optional units established in accordance 
with part 457 of this title. Insured crops may have basic units 
established if the existing unit structure is based on enterprise units 
or whole county units or written agreements. For uninsured and non-
insurable crops, basic units will be established for these purposes.
    (b) County average yield for loss calculations will be the average 
of the 1996 through 2000 official county yields established by CCC, 
excluding the years with the highest and lowest yields, respectively.
    (c) County committees will assign production when the county 
committee determines:
    (1) An acceptable appraisal or record of harvested production does 
not exist;
    (2) The loss is due to an ineligible cause of loss or practices, 
soil type, climate, or other environmental factors, that cause lower 
yields than those upon which the historic yield is based;
    (3) The producer has a contract providing a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop; or
    (4) The crop is planted beyond the normal planting period for the 
crop.
    (d) The county committee shall establish a maximum loss level that 
should reflect the amount of production producers should have produced 
considering the eligible disaster conditions in the area or county for 
the same crop. The maximum loss level for the county shall be expressed 
as either a percent of loss or yield per acre. The maximum loss level 
will apply when:
    (1) Unharvested acreage has not been appraised by FSA, or a company 
reinsured by FCIC; or
    (2) Acceptable production records for harvested acres are not 
available from any source.
    (e) Assigned production or reduced yield for practices that result 
in lower yields than those for which the historic yield is based shall 
be established based on the acres found to have been subjected to those 
practices.
    (f) Assigned production for crops planted beyond the normal planting 
period for the crop shall be calculated according to the lateness of 
planting the crop. With the exception of replanted crops, if the crop is 
planted after the final planting date by:
    (1) Through 10 calendar days, the assigned production reduction will 
be based on one percent of the payment yield for each day involved;
    (2) Eleven (11) through 24 calendar days, the assigned production 
reduction will be based on 10 percent of the payment yield plus an 
additional two percent reduction of the payment yield for each day of 
days 11 through 24 that are involved; and
    (3) Twenty-five (25) or more calendar days or a date from which the 
crop would not reasonably be expected to mature by harvest, the assigned 
production reduction will be based on 50 percent of the payment yield or 
such greater amount determined by the county committee to be 
appropriate.

[[Page 718]]

    (4) CCC may adjust items 1 through 3 to make a comparable assignment 
for short rotation crops such as vegetables which may have a 30-day 
growing period.
    (g) Assigned production for producers with contracts to receive a 
guaranteed payment for production of an eligible crop will be 
established by the county committee by:
    (1) Determining the total amount of guaranteed payment for the unit;
    (2) Converting the guaranteed payment to guaranteed production by 
dividing the total amount of guaranteed payment by the approved county 
price for the crop or variety or such other factor deemed appropriate if 
otherwise the production would appear to be too high; and
    (3) Establishing the production for the unit as the greater of the 
actual net production for the unit or the guaranteed payment, or 
combination thereof if greater.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.10  Eligible disaster conditions.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part 
applies to losses where the crop could not be planted or crop 
production, both in quantity and quality, was adversely affected by 
disasters as defined in 1480.3 or:
    (1) Insect infestation as a related condition to damaging weather if 
documented by COC with published data;
    (2) Disease as a related condition to damaging weather;
    (3) Plum pox virus;

was compensated by the Government entity or water district);
    (9) Grasshoppers;
    (10) Lack of water supply due to drought conditions for irrigated 
crops;
    (11) Mormon crickets; or
    (12) Other causes or factors as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (b) Disaster benefits will not be available under this part if the 
crop could not be planted or crop production, both in quantity and 
quality, was adversely affected by:
    (1) Poor farming practices;
    (2) Poor management decisions; or
    (3) Drifting herbicides.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.11  Qualifying 2001 or 2002-crop losses.

    (a) To receive disaster benefits under this part, the county 
committee must determine that because of a disaster, the producer with 
respect to the 2001 or 2002 crop year:
    (1) Was prevented from planting a crop;
    (2) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the expected 
production of a crop; or
    (3) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the value for value 
loss crops.
    (b) Calculation of benefits under this part shall not include 
losses:
    (1) That are the result of poor management decisions or poor farming 
practices as determined by the county committee on a case-by-case basis;
    (2) That are the result of the failure of the producer to re-seed or 
replant to the same crop in the county where it is customary to re-seed 
or replant after a loss;
    (3) That are not as a result of a natural disaster, unless otherwise 
specified in Sec. 1480.10;
    (4) To crops not intended for harvest in crop year 2002;
    (5) To losses of by-products resulting from processing or harvesting 
a crop, such as cotton seed, peanut shells, wheat or oat straw;
    (6) To home gardens;
    (7) That are a result of water contained or released by any 
governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project if an easement 
exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of the 
water; or
    (8) If losses could be attributed to conditions occurring outside of 
the applicable crop year growing season.
    (c) Calculation of benefits under this part for ornamental nursery 
stock shall not include losses:
    (1) Caused by a failure of power supply or brownouts;

[[Page 719]]

    (2) Caused by the inability to market nursery stock as a result of 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;
    (3) Caused by fire;
    (4) Affecting crops where weeds and other forms of undergrowth in 
the vicinity of the nursery stock that have not been controlled; or
    (5) Caused by the collapse or failure of buildings or structures.
    (d) Calculation of benefits under this part for honey where the 
honey production by colonies or bees was diminished, shall not include 
losses:
    (1) Where the inability to extract was due to the unavailability of 
equipment; the collapse or failure of equipment or apparatus used in the 
honey operation;
    (2) Resulting from improper storage of honey;
    (3) To honey production because of bee feeding;
    (4) Caused by the application of chemicals;
    (5) Caused by theft, fire, or vandalism;
    (6) Caused by the movement of bees by the producer or any other 
person;
    (7) Due to disease or pest infestation of the colonies; or
    (8) Loss calculations shall take into account other conditions and 
adjustments provided for in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.12  Rates and yields; calculating payments.

    (a)(1) Payments made under this part to a producer for a loss on a 
unit with respect to yield based crops are determined by multiplying the 
payment rate established for the crop by CCC, times the loss of 
production which exceeds 35 percent of the expected production, as 
determined by CCC, of the unit.
    (2) Payments made under this part to a producer for a loss on a unit 
with respect to value based crops are determined by multiplying: the 
payment rate established for the crop by CCC, times the loss of value 
which exceeds 35 percent of the expected production value, as determined 
by CCC, of the unit.
    (3) Payments made under this part may be adjusted by CCC to reflect 
losses due to quality factors adversely affected by a disaster. For FSA 
loan commodities, production to count may be reduced using the schedule 
of premiums and discounts for FSA commodity loans. Additional quality 
loss adjustments may be made for single market crops, using a 20 percent 
quality loss threshold. The quality loss threshold may be determined by 
multiplying: 65 percent of the affected quantity, times 65 percent of 
the result of subtracting: the value of the crop due to the effects of 
the disaster, as determined by CCC, from the value of the crop if it had 
not been affected by the disaster, as determined by CCC. Quality 
adjustments for multiple market crops sold to a lower priced market as a 
result of poor quality will be determined by using the difference 
between the average market price for the intended use and the average 
market price for the actual use, as determined by CCC.
    (b) Payment rates for 2001 or 2002 year crop losses shall be:
    (1) 50 percent of the maximum established RMA price for insured 
crops;
    (2) 50 percent of the State average price for non-insurable crops; 
and
    (3) 45 percent of the maximum established RMA price for uninsured 
crops.
    (c) Except as provided elsewhere in this part, disaster benefits 
under this part for losses to crops shall be paid in an amount 
determined by multiplying the loss of production in excess of 35 percent 
of the expected production by the applicable payment rate established 
according to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Up to three separate payment rates and yields for the same crop 
may be established by the county committee as authorized by the Deputy 
Administrator, when there is supporting data from NASS or other sources 
approved by CCC that show there is a significant difference in yield or 
value based on a distinct and separate end use of the crop. In spite of 
differences in yield or values, separate rates or yields shall not be 
established for crops with different cultural practices, such as 
organically or hydroponically grown.
    (e) Production from all end uses of a multi-use crop or all 
secondary uses for

[[Page 720]]

multiple market crops will be calculated separately and summarized 
together.
    (f) Each eligible producer's share of a disaster payment shall be 
based on the producer's share of the crop or crop proceeds, or, if no 
crop was produced, the share the producer would have received if the 
crop had been produced.
    (g) When calculating a payment for a unit loss:
    (1) An unharvested payment factor shall be applied to crop acreage 
planted but not harvested;
    (2) A prevented planting factor shall be applied to any prevented 
planted acreage eligible for payment; and
    (3) Unharvested payment factors may be adjusted if costs normally 
associated with growing the crop are not incurred.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.13  Production losses, producer responsibility.

    (a) Where available and determined accurate, RMA loss records will 
be used for insured crops.
    (b) If RMA loss records are not available, or if the FSA county 
committee determines the RMA loss records are inaccurate or incomplete, 
or if the FSA county committee makes inquiry, producers are responsible 
for:
    (1) Retaining or providing, when required, the best verifiable or 
reliable production records available for the crop;
    (2) Summarizing all the production evidence;
    (3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, 
whether or not records reflect this production;
    (4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily 
understood by the county committee; and
    (5) Providing supporting documentation if the county committee has 
reason to question the disaster event or that all production has been 
accounted for.
    (c) In determining production under this section the producer must 
supply verifiable or reliable production records to substantiate 
production to the county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or 
otherwise disposed of through commercial channels, production records 
include: commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger 
sheets; or load summaries; appraisal information from a loss adjuster 
acceptable to CCC. If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to 
livestock, or disposed of in means other than commercial channels, 
production records for these purposes include: truck scale tickets; 
appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to CCC; 
contemporaneous diaries; or other documentary evidence, such as 
contemporaneous measurements.
    (d) Producers must provide all records for any production of a crop 
that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed 
payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.14  Determination of production.

    (a) Production under this part shall include all harvested 
production, unharvested appraised production and assigned production for 
the total planted acreage of the crop on the unit.
    (b) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more 
than once in a crop year shall include the total harvested production 
from all these harvests.
    (c) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested as the 
intended use, the actual harvested production shall be used to determine 
benefits.
    (d) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing 
assistance loans with an intended use of grain but harvested as silage, 
ensilage, cobbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be 
adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent as established by CCC.
    (e) For crops with an established yield and market price for 
multiple intended uses, a value will be calculated for each use with:
    (1) The intended use or uses for disaster purposes based on 
historical production and acreage evidence provided by the producer; and
    (2) The eligible acres for each use and the calculation of the 
disaster payment will be determined by the county committee according to 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (f) For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for 
the crop with no established county average yield and market price, 45 
percent of

[[Page 721]]

the salvage value received will be deducted from the disaster payment.
    (g) If a producer does not receive compensation based upon the 
quantity of the commodity delivered to a purchaser, but has an agreement 
or contract for guaranteed payment for production, for purposes of 
determination the production shall be the greater of the actual 
production or the guaranteed payment converted to production as 
determined by CCC.
    (h) Production that is commingled between units before it was a 
matter or combination of record and cannot be separated by using records 
or other means acceptable to CCC shall be prorated to each respective 
unit by CCC. Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable 
unit, if the producer made the unit production of a commodity a matter 
of record before commingling and does any of the following, as 
applicable:
    (1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production 
of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from 
beyond the unit;
    (2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the county 
committee; or
    (3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner 
acceptable to the county committee.
    (i) The county committee shall assign production for the unit when 
the county committee determines that:
    (1) The producer has failed to provide adequate and acceptable 
production records;
    (2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not 
covered by this part, or circumstances other than natural disaster, and 
there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause of 
loss;
    (3) The producer carries out a practice, such as multiple cropping, 
that generally results in lower yields than the established historic 
yields;
    (4) The producer has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment for 
all or a portion of the crop.
    (5) A crop is late-planted;
    (6) Unharvested acreage was not timely appraised; or
    (7) Other appropriate causes exist for such assignment as determined 
by the Deputy Administrator.
    (j) For peanuts, the actual production shall be all peanuts 
harvested for nuts regardless of their disposition or use as adjusted 
for low quality.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.15  Calculation of acreage for crop losses other than prevented 
planted.

    (a) Acreage shall be calculated using the number of acres shown to 
have been planted to a crop.
    (b) In cases where there is a repeat crop or a multiple planted crop 
in more than one planting period, or if there is multiple cropped 
acreage meeting criteria established in paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section, each of these crops may be considered separate crops for 2001 
or 2002 CDP if the county committee determines that all of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted with 
an intent to harvest;
    (2) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted 
within the normal planting period for that crop;
    (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other 
eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices; 
and
    (4) Each planting could reach maturity if each planting was 
harvested or would have been harvested.
    (c) In cases where there is multiple cropped acreage, each crop may 
be eligible for disaster assistance separately if both of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The specific crops are approved by the State Committee as 
eligible multiple-cropping practices in accordance with procedures 
approved by the Deputy Administrator; and
    (2) The farm containing the multiple cropped acreage has a history 
of multiple cropping based on timely filed crop acreage reports.
    (d) Producers with multiple cropped acreage not meeting the criteria 
in paragraph (c) of this section may be eligible for disaster assistance 
on more than one crop if the producer has verifiable records 
establishing a history of carrying out a successful multiple cropping 
practice on the specific

[[Page 722]]

crops for which assistance is requested. All required records acceptable 
to CCC as determined by the Deputy Administrator must be provided before 
payments are issued.
    (e) Producers with multiple cropped acreage not meeting the criteria 
in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section must select the crop for which 
assistance will be requested. If more than one producer has an interest 
in the multiple cropped acreage, all producers must agree to the crop 
designated for payment by the end of the application period or no 
payment will be approved for any crop on the multiple cropped acreage.
    (f) Benefits under this part shall apply to irrigated crops where 
the acreage was affected by a lack of water or contamination by 
saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought 
conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.16  Calculation of prevented planted acreage.

    (a) When determining losses under this part, prevented-planted 
acreage will be considered separately from planted acreage of the same 
crop.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for insured 
crops, disaster payments under this part for prevented-planted acreage 
shall not be made unless RMA documentation indicates that the eligible 
producer received a prevented planting payment under the RMA-
administered program.
    (c) For insured crops, disaster payments under this part for 
prevented-planted acreage will be made available for the following crops 
for which prevented planting coverage was not available and for which 
the county committee will make an eligibility determination according to 
paragraph (d) of this section: peppers; sweet corn (fresh market); 
tomatoes (fresh market); tomatoes (processing).
    (d) The producer must prove, to the satisfaction of the county 
committee, an intent to plant the crop and that such crop could not be 
planted because of an eligible disaster. The county committee must be 
able to determine the producer was prevented from planting the crop by 
an eligible disaster that:
    (1) Prevented other producers from planting on acreage with similar 
characteristics in the surrounding area; and
    (2) Occurred after the previous planting period for the crop.
    (3) Unless otherwise approved by the Deputy Administrator, began no 
earlier than the planting season for that crop.
    (e) Prevented planted disaster benefits under this part shall not 
apply to:
    (1) Aquaculture, including ornamental fish; perennial forage crops 
grown for hay, seed, or grazing; honey; maple sap; millet; mint; nursery 
crops; cultivated wild rice; fresh market beans; cabbage, pumpkins, 
sweet potatoes; winter squash, turfgrass sod, and vine crops;
    (2) Uninsured crop acreage that is unclassified for insurance 
purposes;
    (3) Acreage that is used for conservation purposes or intended to be 
left unplanted under any CCC or USDA program;
    (4) Any acreage on which a crop other than a cover crop was 
harvested, hayed, or grazed during the crop year;
    (5) Any acreage for which a cash lease payment is received for the 
use of the acreage the same crop year unless the county committee 
determines the lease was for haying and grazing rights only and was not 
a lease for use of the land;
    (6) Acreage for which planting history or conservation plans 
indicate that the acreage would have remained fallow for crop rotation 
purposes;
    (7) Acreage for which the producer or any other person received a 
prevented planted payment for any crop for the same acreage, excluding 
share arrangements;
    (8) Acreage for which the producer cannot provide proof to the 
county committee that inputs such as seed, chemicals, and fertilizer 
were available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of at 
least producing a normal yield; and
    (9) Any other acreage for which, for whatever reason, there is cause 
to question whether the crop could have been planted for a successful 
and timely harvest, or for which prevented planting credit is not 
allowed under the provisions of this part.

[[Page 723]]

    (f) Prevented planting payments are not provided on acreage that had 
either a previous or subsequent crop planted on the acreage, unless the 
county committee determines that all of the following conditions are 
met:
    (1) There is an established practice of planting two or more crops 
for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year;
    (2) Both crops could have reached maturity if each planting was 
harvested or would have been harvested;
    (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted or 
prevented-planting within the normal planting period for that crop;
    (4) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other 
eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices; 
and
    (5) The specific crops meet the eligibility criteria for a separate 
crop designation as a repeat or approved multiple cropping practice set 
out in Sec. 1480.15.
    (g)(1) Disaster benefits under this part shall not apply to crops 
where the prevented-planted acreage was affected by a disaster that was 
caused by drought unless on the final planting date or the late planting 
period for non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being 
planted has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed and 
progress toward crop maturity because of a prolonged period of dry 
weather;
    (2) Prolonged precipitation deficiencies must be at the D2 level or 
higher as determined by using the U.S. Drought Monitor; and
    (3) Verifiable information collected by sources whose business or 
purpose to record weather conditions, including but not limited to the 
local weather reporting stations of the U.S. National Weather Service.
    (h) Prevented planting benefits under this part shall apply to 
irrigated crops where the acreage was prevented from being planted due 
to a lack of water resulting from drought conditions or contamination by 
saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought 
conditions.
    (i) For uninsured or non-insurable crops and the insured crops 
listed in paragraph (c) of this section, for prevented planting 
purposes:
    (1) The maximum prevented-planted acreage for all crops cannot 
exceed the number of acres of cropland in the unit for the crop year and 
will be reduced by the number of acres planted in the unit;
    (2) The maximum prevented planted acreage for a crop cannot exceed 
the number of acres planted by the producer, or that was prevented from 
being planted, to the crop in any 1 of the 4 crop years previous to the 
disaster year as determined by the county committee;
    (3) For crops grown under a contract specifying the number of acres 
contracted, the prevented-planted acreage is limited to the result of 
the number of acres specified in the contract minus planted acreage;
    (4) For each crop type or variety for which separate prices or 
yields are sought for prevented-planted acreage, the producer must 
provide evidence that the claimed prevented-planted acres were 
successfully planted in at least 1 of the most recent 4 crop years; and
    (5) The prevented planted acreage must be at least 20 acres or 20

Sec. 1480.17  Quantity adjustments for diminished quality for certain 
crops.

    (a) For the crops identified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
subject to this part, the quantity of production of crops of the 
producer shall be adjusted to reflect diminished quality resulting from 
the disaster.
    (b) Crops eligible for quality adjustments to production are limited 
to:
    (1) Barley; canola; corn; cotton; crambe, flaxseed; grain sorghum; 
mustard seed; oats; peanuts; rapeseed; rice; safflower; soybeans; 
sunflower-oil; sunflower-seed; wheat; and
    (2) Crops with multiple market uses such as fresh, processed or 
juice, as supported by NASS data or other data as CCC determines 
acceptable.

[[Page 724]]

    (3) Single market crops if the COC determines there is sufficient 
data to establish 5 quality loss levels.
    (c) The producer must submit documentation for determining the grade 
and other discount factors that were applied to the crop.
    (d) Quality adjustments will be applied to crops experiencing at 
least a 20 percent loss after production has been adjusted to standard 
moisture, when applicable.
    (e) For all crops listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except 
for cotton, if a quality adjustment has been made for multi-peril crop 
insurance purposes, an additional adjustment will not be made.
    (f) Quality adjustments for crops, other than cotton and peanuts 
listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be made by applying an 
adjustment factor based on dividing the CCC marketing assistance loan 
rate applicable to the crop and producer determined according to part 
1421 of this chapter by the unadjusted county marketing assistance loan 
rate for the crop. For crops that receive a grade of ``sample'' and are 
marketed through normal channels, production will be adjusted as 
determined by CCC. County committees may, with state committee 
concurrence, establish county average quality adjustment factors.
    (g) Quality adjustments for cotton shall be based on the difference 
between:
    (1) The loan rate applicable to the crop and producer determined 
according to part 1427 of this chapter; and
    (2) The adjusted county loan rate. The adjusted county rate is the 
county loan rate adjusted for the 5-year county average historical 
quality premium or discount, as determined by CCC.
    (h) For 2001 quota and non-quota peanuts and 2002 peanuts, quality 
adjustments shall be based on the difference between the actual sales 
price, or other proceeds, received and the National average support 
price by type of peanut for the applicable crop year.
    (i) Quality adjustments for crops with multiple market uses such as 
fresh, processed and juice, shall be applied based on the difference 
between the producer's historical marketing percentage of each market 
use compared to the actual percentage for the 2001 or 2002 crop year. 
These quality adjustments are built into the production loss 
determination. Production determinations from Federal crop insurance 
will not be used.
    (j) Except as determined by the Deputy Administrator, quality 
adjustments for aflatoxin shall be based on the aflatoxin level. The 
producer must provide the county committee with proof of a price 
reduction because of aflatoxin. The aflatoxin level must be 20 parts per 
billion or more before a quality adjustment will be made. The quality 
adjustment factor applied to affected production is .50 if the 
production is marketable. If the production is unmarketable due to 
aflatoxin levels of at least 20 parts per billion, production will be 
adjusted to zero. Any value received will be considered salvage.
    (k) Any quantity of the crop determined to be salvage will not be 
considered production. Salvage values shall be factored by 0.45 times 
the producer's share. This amount will be deducted from the disaster 
payment.
    (l) Quantity adjustments for diminished quality under this section 
will not be applied to crops that are, under Sec. 1480.18, value loss 
crops.
    (m) Quantity adjustments for diminished quality shall also not apply 
under this section to: honey, maple sap, turfgrass sod, crops marketed 
for a use other than an intended use for which there is not an 
established county price or yield, or any other crop that the Deputy 
Administrator deems it appropriate to exclude.

<R05>
Sec. 1480.18  Value loss crops.

    (a) Irrespective of any inconsistent provisions in other sections, 
this section shall apply to the following crops, which are considered 
``value loss crops'': ornamental nursery; Christmas trees; vegetable and 
root stock including ginseng root; aquaculture, including ornamental 
fish, and such other crops as may be determined appropriate for 
treatment as ``value loss crops''.
    (b) For crops specified in paragraph (a) of this section, disaster 
benefits under this part are calculated based on

[[Page 725]]

the loss of value at the time of disaster, as determined by CCC.
    (c) For aquaculture, disaster benefits under this part for 
aquacultural species are limited to those aquacultural species that were 
placed in the aquacultural facility by the producer. CDP benefits shall 
not be available for aquacultural species that are growing naturally in 
the aquaculture facility. Benefits under this part are limited to 
aquacultural species that were planted or seeded on property owned or 
leased by the producer where that land has readily identifiable 
boundaries, and over which the producer has total control of the 
waterbed and the ground under the waterbed. Producers who only have 
control of the waterbed or the ground under the waterbed but not both 
will not be eligible for disaster benefits under this part.
    (d) For ornamental nursery crops, disaster benefits under this part 
are limited to ornamental nursery crops that were grown in a container 
or controlled environment for commercial sale on property owned or 
leased by the producer, and cared for and managed using good nursery 
growing practices. Indigenous crops are not eligible for benefits under 
this part. Producers who participated in the previous Florida Nursery 
Program are eligible for either of the following:
    (1) 2001 losses that occurred between January 1, 2001 and September 
30, 2001.
    (2) 2002 losses that occurred between October 1, 2001 and September 
30, 2002.
    (e) For vegetable and root stock, disaster benefits under this part 
are limited to plants grown in a container or controlled environment for 
use as transplants or root stock by the producer for commercial sale on 
property owned or leased by the producer and managed using good 
rootstock or fruit and vegetable plant growing practices.
    (f) For ginseng, only ginseng that meets all the requirements of 
cultivated ginseng shall be considered as eligible for benefits under 
this part. Ginseng is defined as cultivated ginseng roots and seeds that 
meet the following requirements:
    (1) Grown in raised beds above and away from wet and low areas 
protected from flood;
    (2) Grown under man-made canopies that provide 75 to 80 percent 
shade coverage;
    (3) Grown in well drained media with a pH adjustment of at least 5.5 
and which protects plants from disease; and
    (4) Grown with sufficient fertility and weed control to obtain 
expected production results of ginseng root and seed.
    (g) Evidence of the above ginseng practice requirements must be 
provided by the producer if requested by the county committee. Any 
ginseng that is grown under cultivated practices or simulated wild or 
woodland conditions that do not meet these requirements are not eligible 
for disaster assistance under this part.
    (h) Because ginseng is a perennial crop, the producer must provide 
annual crop history to establish when the loss occurred and the extent 
of such loss. If the producer does not or is unable to provide annual 
records to establish the beginning inventory, before the loss, and 
ending inventory, after the loss, production shall be assigned by the 
county committee.
    (i) Aside from differences provided for in this section, all other 
conditions for eligibility contained in this part shall be applied to 
value loss crops.


<R05>
Sec. 1480.19  Other provisions for specialty crops.

    (a) For turfgrass sod, disaster benefits under this part are limited 
to turfgrass sod that would have matured and been harvested during 2001 
or 2002, when a disaster caused in excess of 35 percent of the expected 
production to die.
    (b) For honey, disaster benefits under this part are limited to 
table and non-table honey produced commercially for human consumption. 
For calculating benefits, all honey is considered a single crop, 
regardless of type or variety of floral source or intended use.
    (c) For maple sap, disaster benefits under this part are limited to 
maple sap produced on private property in a controlled environment by a 
commercial operator for sale as sap or syrup. The maple sap must be 
produced from trees that are: located on land the producer controls by 
ownership or lease; managed for production of maple sap;

shall not be entitled to disaster payments and must refund all such 
payments received, plus interest as determined in accordance with part 
1403 of this chapter.
    (b) A producer shall refund to CCC all disaster payments, plus 
interest as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, 
received by such producer with respect to all contracts if the producer 
is determined to have knowingly done any of the following.
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

or portion thereof to any person shall be made without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found at part 1403 of this chapter 
apply to payments.
    (b) Any producer entitled to any payment may assign any payments in 
accordance with regulations governing the assignment of payments found 
at part 1404 of this chapter.
    (c) A debt or claim may be settled according to part 1403 of this 
chapter.

[[Page 734]]


<R05>
Sec. 1484.12  What is the Cooperator program?

    (a) Under the Foreign Market Development Cooperator (Cooperator) 
Program, FAS enters into project agreements with eligible nonprofit U.S. 
trade organizations to share the costs of certain overseas marketing and 
promotion activities that are intended to create, expand, or maintain 
foreign markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and products. FAS does 
not provide brand promotion assistance to Cooperators under this 
program.
    (b) FAS enters into project agreements with those eligible nonprofit 
U.S. trade organizations that have the broadest possible producer 
representation of the commodity being promoted and gives priority to 
those organizations that are nationwide in membership and scope. Project 
agreements involve the promotion of agricultural commodities on a 
generic basis. Project agreements do not involve activities targeted 
directly toward consumers purchasing as individuals. Activities must 
contribute to the maintenance or growth of demand for the agricultural 
commodities and generally address long-term foreign import constraints 
and export growth opportunities by focusing on matters such as reducing 
infra-structural or historical market impediments; improving processing 
capabilities; modifying codes and standards; and identifying new markets 
or new applications or uses for the agricultural commodity or product in 
the foreign market.
    (c) The Cooperator program generally operates on a reimbursement 
basis.
    (d) FAS policy is to ensure that benefits generated by Cooperator 
agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural 
sector and no one entity gains an undue advantage or sole benefit from 
program activities.

conducted under the project agreement.
    (b) FAS may require that a project agreement include a contribution 
level greater than that specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In 
requiring a higher contribution level, FAS will take into account such 
factors as past Cooperator contributions, previous Cooperator program 
funding levels, the length of time an entity participates in the 
program, and the entity's ability to increase its contribution.
    (c) FAS will enter into Cooperator agreements only for the promotion 
of eligible commodities.


<R04>
                Subpart B_Application and Fund Allocation


<R05>
Sec. 1484.20  How can my organization apply to the Cooperator program?

    (14) A certification statement, and, if requested by the Deputy 
Administrator, a written explanation supporting the certification, that 
any funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or 
industry funds or other contributions to program activities. The written 
explanation, if necessary, shall indicate why the Cooperator is unlikely 
to carry out the activities without Federal financial assistance. The 
certification shall also state that information contained in the 
application is true and accurate and that all records supporting the 
claim that project funds do not supplant other funds will be made 
available to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
    (b) Strategic plan and performance measures. All Cooperator program 
applications shall also contain:
    (1) A description of the U.S. and world market situation for the

request for approval of salaries above the Foreign Service National 
(FSN) salary plan. To request approval of a salary above the FSN salary 
plan, the Cooperator shall include a detailed description of both the 
duties and responsibilities of the position, and of the qualifications 
and background of the individual concerned. The Cooperator shall also 
justify, based on a verifiable local salary survey or other documented 
local salary information, why the highest FSN salary level is 
inappropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.21  How does FAS determine which Cooperator program applications 
are approved?

    (a) General. FAS allocates funds in a manner that effectively 
supports the strategic decision-making initiatives of the Government 
Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. In deciding whether a 
proposed project will contribute to the effective creation, expansion, 
or maintenance of foreign markets, FAS seeks to identify those projects 
that would demonstrate a clear, long-term agricultural trade strategy by 
market or product and a

[[Page 737]]

program effectiveness time line against which results can be measured at 
specific intervals using quantifiable product or country or region 
goals. These performance indicators are part of FAS' resource allocation 
strategy to fund applicants which can demonstrate performance based on a 
long-term strategic plan and address the performance measurement 
objectives of the GPRA.
    (b) Approval criteria. FAS will consider a number of factors when 
reviewing proposed projects, including:
    (1) The ability of the organization to provide an experienced U.S.-
based staff with technical and international trade expertise to ensure 
adequate development, supervision, and execution of the proposed 
project;
    (2) The organization's willingness to contribute resources, 
including cash and goods and services of the U.S. industry and foreign 
third parties;
    (3) The conditions or constraints affecting the level of U.S. 
exports and market share for the agricultural commodities and products;
    (4) The degree to which the proposed project is likely to contribute 
to the creation, expansion, or maintenance of foreign markets;
    (5) The degree to which the strategic plan is coordinated with other 
private or U.S. government-funded market development projects;
    (6) Past program results and evaluations, if applicable; and
    (7) Previous Cooperator program funding.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.22  How are Cooperator program funds allocated?

    After determining which applications to recommend for approval, the 
Commodity Divisions recommend funding levels for the approved applicants 
within their respective divisions. Applications then compete for funds 
on the basis of the following allocation criteria (the number in 
parentheses represents a percentage weight factor). Data used in the 
calculations for contribution levels, past export performance and past 
demand expansion performance will cover not more than a 6-year period, 
to the extent such data is available. The method for applying the 
following criteria will be described in the Cooperator program 
announcement in the Federal Register:
    (a) Contribution Level (40%).
    (b) Past Export Performance (20%).
    (c) Past Demand Expansion Performance (20%).
    (d) Future Demand Expansion Goals (10%).
    (e) Accuracy of Past Demand Expansion Projections (10%).

                      Subpart C_Program Operations


<R05>
Sec. 1484.30  How does FAS formalize its working relationship with 
approved Cooperators?

    FAS will notify each applicant in writing of the final disposition 
of its application. FAS will send a program agreement, allocation 
approval letter, and a signature card to each approved applicant. The 
allocation approval letter will specify any special terms and conditions 
applicable to a Cooperator's program, including the required level of 
Cooperator contribution. An applicant that accepts the terms and 
conditions contained in the program agreement and allocation approval 
letter should so indicate by having its Chief Executive Officer sign the 
program agreement and submit the signed agreement to the Director, 
Marketing Operations Staff, FAS, USDA. Final agreement shall occur when 
the Administrator signs the agreement on behalf of FAS. The application, 
the program agreement, the allocation approval letter, and this part 
shall establish the terms and conditions of a Cooperator agreement 
between FAS and the approved applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.31  Who acts on behalf of each Cooperator?

    The Cooperator shall designate at least two individuals in its 
organization to sign program agreements, reimbursement claims, and 
requests. The Cooperator shall submit the signature card signed by those 
designated individuals and by the Cooperator's Chief Executive Officer 
to the Director, Marketing Operations Staff, FAS, USDA, prior to the 
start of the marketing plan year. The Cooperator shall immediately 
notify the Director of any changes in signatories (e.g., removal or 
addition of individuals, name changes,

[[Page 738]]

etc.), and shall submit a revised signature card accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.32  Must Cooperators follow specific employment practices?

    (a) A Cooperator shall enter into written contracts with all 
overseas employees and shall ensure that all terms, conditions, and 
related formalities of such contracts conform to governing local law.
    (b) A Cooperator shall, in its overseas offices, conform its office 
hours, work week, and holidays to local law and to the custom generally 
observed by U.S. commercial entities in the local business community.
    (c) A Cooperator may pay salaries or fees in any currency (U.S. or 
foreign) in conformance with contract specifications. Cooperators are 
cautioned to consult local laws regarding currency restrictions.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.33  Must Cooperators follow certain financial management 
guidelines?

    (a) A Cooperator shall implement and maintain a financial management 
system that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles.
    (b) A Cooperator shall institute internal controls and provide 
written guidance to commercial entities participating in its activities 
to ensure their compliance with these provisions. Each Cooperator shall 
maintain all original records and documents relating to program 
activities for 5 calendar years following the end of the applicable 
marketing plan year and shall make such records and documents available 
upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government. A

[[Page 745]]

FAS only to Cooperators with foreign offices supported with project 
funds. The second is a special advance payment used to pay an impending

provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, 7 CFR 
part 1, Subpart A--Official Records, and, specifically, 7 CFR 1.11--
Handling Information from a Private Business.
    (b) If requested by a person located in the United States, a 
Cooperator shall provide to such person a copy of any document in its 
possession or control containing market information developed and 
produced under the terms of its agreement. The Cooperator may charge a 
fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and 
distributing the materials.
    (c) The results of any research conducted by a Cooperator under an 
agreement shall be the property of the U.S. Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.72  How is program effectiveness measured?

    (a) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 
U.S.C.

[[Page 746]]

306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance 
measurement of Federal programs, including the Cooperator program. 
Evaluation of the Cooperator program's effectiveness will depend on a 
clear statement by each Cooperator of the constraints and opportunities 
facing U.S. exports, goals to be met within a specified time, a schedule 
of measurable milestones for gauging success, a plan for achievement, 
and reports of activity results.
    (b) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and 
implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The 
evaluation results guide the development and scope of a Cooperator's 
program, contribute to program accountability, and provide evidence of 
program effectiveness.
    (c) A Cooperator shall conduct periodic evaluations of its program 
and activities and may contract with an independent evaluator to satisfy 
this requirement. FAS reserves the right to have direct input and 
control over design, scope, and methodology of any such evaluation, 
including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the 
independent evaluator.
    (d) A Cooperator shall complete at least one program evaluation each 
year. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be 
determined by the Cooperator and the Division Director and specified in 
the Cooperator's application approval letter. A program evaluation shall 
contain:
    (1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
    (2) The activities covered by the evaluation;
    (3) A concise statement of the constraint(s) and opportunities and 
the goals specified in the application;
    (4) A description of the evaluation methodology;
    (5) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the 
ratio of additional export sales in relation to Cooperator program 
funding received;
    (6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
    (7) Recommendations for future programs.
    (e) A Cooperator shall submit, via a cover letter to the Division 
Director, an executive summary which assesses the program evaluation's 
findings and recommendations and proposes changes in program strategy or 
design as a result of the evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 1484.73  Are Cooperators penalized for failing to make required 
contributions?

    A Cooperator's contribution requirement is specified in the 
Cooperator program allocation letter. If a Cooperator fails to 
contribute the amount specified in its allocation approval letter, the 
Cooperator shall pay to Commodity Credit Corporation in U.S. dollars the 
difference between the amount it has contributed and the amount 
specified in the allocation approval letter. A Cooperator shall remit 
such payment by December 31 following the end of the marketing plan 
year.

<R05>
Sec. 1484.74  How is Cooperator program compliance monitored?

    (a) The Compliance Review Staff (CRS), FAS, performs periodic on-
site reviews of Cooperators to ensure compliance with this part.
    (b) In order to verify that federal funds received by a Cooperator 
do not supplant private or U.S. industry funds or contributions pursuant 
to Sec. 1550.20(a)(14), FAS will consider the Cooperator's overall 
marketing budget from year to year, variations in promotional strategies 
within a country or region, and new markets.
    (c) The Director, CRS, will notify a Cooperator through a compliance 
report when it appears that Commodity Credit Corporation may be entitled 
to recover funds from that Cooperator. The compliance report will state 
the basis for this action.

9996, Feb. 25, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1484.75  How does a Cooperator respond to a compliance report?

    (a) A Cooperator shall, within 60 days of the date of the compliance 
report, submit a written response to the Director, CRS. This response 
shall include any money owed to Commodity Credit Corporation if the 
Cooperator does not wish to contest the compliance report. The Director, 
CRS, at the Director's

[[Page 747]]

discretion, may extend the period for response up to an additional 30 
days. If the Cooperator does not respond to the compliance report within 
the required time period or, if after review of the Cooperator's 
response, the Director, CRS, determines that Commodity Credit 
Corporation may be entitled to recover funds from the Cooperator, the 
Director, CRS, will refer the compliance report to the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (b) If, after review of the compliance report and response, the 
Deputy Administrator determines that the Cooperator owes money to FAS, 
the Deputy Administrator will so inform the Cooperator. The Deputy 
Administrator may initiate action to collect such amount pursuant to 7 
CFR Part 1403, Debt Settlement Policies and Procedures. Determinations 
of the Deputy Administrator will be in writing and in sufficient detail 
to inform the Cooperator of the basis for the determination. The 
Cooperator has 30 days from the date of the Deputy Administrator's 
initial determination to submit any money owed to Commodity Credit 
Corporation or to request reconsideration.

9996, Feb. 25, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1484.76  Can a Cooperator appeal the determinations of the Deputy 
Administrator?

    (a) The Cooperator may appeal the determinations of the Deputy 
Administrator to the Administrator. An appeal must be in writing and be 
submitted to the Office of the Administrator within 30 days following 
the date of the initial determination by the Deputy Administrator or the 
determination on reconsideration. The Cooperator may request a hearing.
    (b) If the Cooperator submits its appeal and requests a hearing, the 
Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, will set a date and 
time, generally within 60 days. The hearing will be an informal 
proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the 
Cooperator bears the cost of a transcript; however, the Administrator 
may have a transcript prepared at FAS's expense.
    (c) The Administrator will base the determination on appeal upon 
information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to 
make a determination within 60 days after submission of the appeal, 
hearing, or receipt of any transcript, whichever is later. The 
determination of the Administrator will be the final determination of 
FAS. The Cooperator must exhaust all administrative remedies contained 
in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by 
the Administrator.

                     Subpart B_Market Access Program


<R05>
Sec. 1485.10  General purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the policies underlying the Commodity 
Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Market Access Program (MAP), 
and a

[[Page 748]]

subcomponent of that program, the Export Incentive Program/Market Access 
Program (EIP/MAP). It also establishes the general terms and conditions 
applicable to MAP and EIP/MAP agreements.
    (b) Under the MAP, CCC enters into agreements with nonprofit trade 
organizations to share the costs of certain overseas marketing and 
promotion activities that are intended to develop, maintain or expand 
commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and 
products. MAP participants may receive assistance for either generic or 
brand promotion activities. EIP/MAP participants are U.S. commercial 
entities that receive assistance for brand promotion activities.
    (c) The MAP and EIP/MAP generally operate on a reimbursement basis, 
and CCC may, at its option, provide such reimbursement either in cash or 
in CCC commodity certificates.
    (d) CCC's policy is to ensure that benefits generated by MAP and 
EIP/MAP agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant 
agricultural sector and no one entity gains an undue advantage. The MAP 
and EIP/MAP are administered by personnel of the Foreign Agricultural 
Service.

FR 29940, June 2, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1485.14  Application approval and formation of agreements.

    (a) General. CCC will, consistent with available resources, approve 
those applications which it considers to present the best opportunity 
for developing, maintaining or expanding export markets for U.S. 
agricultural commodities. The selection process, by its nature, involves 
the exercise of judgment. CCC's choice of participants and proposed 
promotion projects requires that it consider and weigh a number of 
factors that cannot be mathematically measured--i.e., market 
opportunity, market strategy and management capability.
    (b) Approval criteria. In assessing the applications it receives and 
determining which it will approve, CCC considers the following criteria:
    (1) The effectiveness of program management;
    (2) Soundness of accounting procedures;
    (3) The nature of the applicant organization, with greater weight 
given to those organizations with the broadest base of producer 
representation;
    (4) Prior export promotion or direct export experience;
    (5) Previous MAP funding;
    (6) Adequacy of the applicant's strategic plan in the following 
categories:
    (i) Description of market conditions;
    (ii) Description of, and plan for addressing, market constraints;
    (iii) Reasonable likelihood of plan success;
    (iv) Export volume and value and market share goals in each country;
    (v) Description of evaluation plan and suitability of the plan for 
performance measurement; and
    (vi) Past program results and evaluations, if applicable.
    (c) Allocation factors. After determining which applications to 
approve, CCC determines how it will allocate resources among 
participants based on the following factors, in addition to those in 
paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Size of the budget request in relation to projected value of 
exports;

[[Page 753]]

    (2) Where applicable, size of the budget request in relation to 
actual value of exports in prior years;
    (3) Where applicable, participant's past projections of exports 
compared with actual exports;
    (4) Level of participant's, State's, and industry's contributions;
    (5) Market share goals in target country(ies);
    (6) The degree to which the product to be exported consists of U.S. 
grown agricultural commodities;
    (7) The degree of value-added processing in the U.S.; and
    (8) General administrative and overhead costs compared to direct 
promotional costs.
    (9) In the case of a brand promotion program, the percentage of the 
budget that will be made available to small-sized entities as a means of 
providing priority assistance to such entities.
    (d) Approval decision. (1) CCC will approve those applications which 
it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified above. In 
addition, CCC will only approve applications for EIP/MAP when there is 
sufficient U.S. industry need for a brand promotion and there is no 
eligible MAP participant interested in or capable of undertaking the 
brand promotion.
    (2) CCC will not provide assistance to a single company for brand 
promotion in a single country for more than five years. This five year 
period shall not begin prior to the 1994 program or the participant's 
first activity plan year, whichever is later. In limited circumstances, 
the five year limitation may be waived if the Deputy Administrator 
determines that further assistance is necessary in order to meet the 
objectives of the program.
    (e) Formation of agreements. CCC will notify each applicant in 
writing of the final disposition of its application. CCC will send a 
program agreement, allocation approval letter and a signature card to 
each approved applicant. The allocation approval letter will specify any 
special terms and conditions applicable to a participant's program, 
including the required level of participant contribution. An applicant 
that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the program 
agreement and allocation approval letter should so indicate by having 
its Chief Executive Officer sign the program agreement and by submitting 
the signed agreement to the Director, Marketing Operations Staff, FAS, 
USDA. Final agreement shall occur when the Administrator signs the 
agreement on behalf of CCC. The application, the program agreement, the 
allocation approval letter and these regulations shall establish the 
terms and conditions of an MAP or EIP/MAP agreement between CCC and the 
approved applicant.
    (f) Signature cards. The participant shall designate at least two 
individuals in its organization to sign program agreements, 
reimbursement claims and advance requests. The participant shall submit 
the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the 
participant's Chief Executive Officer to the Director, Marketing 
Operations Staff, FAS, USDA, and shall immediately notify the Director 
of any changes in signatories and shall submit a revised signature card 
accordingly.

<R05>
Sec. 1485.15  Activity plan.

    (a) General. A participant shall develop a specific activity plan(s) 
based on its strategic plan and the allocation approval letter and shall 
submit an activity plan for each year in which it engages in program 
activities. An activity plan handbook, available from the Division 
Director, provides suggested formats and codes for activity plans and 
amendments.
    (b) An activity plan shall contain:
    (1) A written presentation of all proposed activities including:
    (i) A short description of the relevant constraint;
    (ii) A description of any changes in strategy from the strategic 
plan;
    (iii) A budget for each proposed activity, identifying the source of 
funds;
    (iv) Specific goals and benchmarks to be used to measure the 
effectiveness of each activity. This will assist CCC in carrying out its 
responsibilities under the Government Performance and Results Act of 
1993 that requires performance measurement of Federal programs, 
including the MAP. Evaluation of MAP's effectiveness will depend on a

[[Page 754]]

clear statement by participants of goals, method of achievement, and 
results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of the MAP 
and of individual participants' activities is to achieve additional 
exports of U.S. agricultural products, that is, sales that would not 
have occurred in the absence of MAP funding.
    (2) A staffing plan for any overseas office, including a listing of 
job titles, position descriptions, salary ranges and any request for 
approval of supergrade salaries; and
    (3) An itemized administrative budget for any overseas office.
    (c) Activity plans for small-sized entities operating through an 
SRTG shall contain a certification that it is a small-sized entity 
within the standards established by 13 CFR part 121.
    (d) Requests for approval of ``supergrades''. (1) Ordinarily, CCC 
will not reimburse any portion of a non-U.S. citizen employees 
compensation that exceeds the highest salary level in the Foreign 
Service National (FSN) salary plan applicable to the country in which 
the employee works. However, a participant may seek a higher level of 
reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen who will be employed as a country 
director or regional director by requesting that CCC approve that 
employee as a ``supergrade''.
    (2) To request approval of a ``supergrade'', the participant shall 
include in its activity plan a detailed description of both the duties 
and responsibilities of the position, and of the qualifications and 
background of the employee concerned. The participant shall also justify 
why the highest FSN salary level is insufficient.
    (3) Where a non-U.S. citizen will be employed as a country director, 
the MAP participant may request approval for a ``Supergrade I'' salary 
level, equivalent to a grade increase over the existing top grade of the 
FSN salary plan. The ``supergrade'' and its step increases are 
calculated as the percentage difference between the second highest and 
the highest grade in the FSN salary plan with that percentage applied to 
each of the steps in the top grade. Where the non-U.S. citizen will be 
employed as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/
or offices in more than one country, the MAP participant may request 
approval for a ``Supergrade II'' salary level which is calculated 
relative to a ``Supergrade I'' in the same way the latter is calculated 
relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary plan.
    (e) Submission of the activity plan. A participant shall submit 
three copies of an activity plan to the Division Director and a copy of 
the relevant country section(s) to the Attach[eacute]/Counselor(s) 
concerned.
    (f) Activity plan approval. CCC shall indicate in an activity plan 
approval letter which activities and budgets are approved or 
disapproved, and shall indicate any special terms and conditions that 
apply to the participant including any requirements with respect to 
contributions and program evaluations. A participant may undertake 
promotional activities directly or through a foreign third party; 
however, the participant shall be responsible and accountable to CCC for 
all such promotional activities and related expenditures.
    (g) Activity plan changes. (1) A participant may request changes to 
an activity plan by submitting one copy of an APAR to each of the 
Division Director and the Attach[eacute]/Counselor(s) concerned.
    (2) An APAR for a new activity shall contain the information 
required in paragraph (b) of this section. All other APAR's shall 
contain the activity description, the proposed budget and a 
justification for transfer of funds, if applicable.

CCC resources accounts;

[[Page 759]]

    (vi) Documentation with accompanying English translation supporting

months after the end of its activity plan year, a participant shall 
submit two copies of a report which identifies, by activity and cost 
category and in U.S. dollar equivalent, contributions made by the 
participant, the U.S. industry and foreign third parties during that 
activity plan year. A suggested format of a contribution report is

upon request any audit reports by independent public accountants.
    (c) Evaluation--(1) Policy. (i) The Government Performance and

3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, 
including MAP. Evaluation of MAP's effectiveness will depend on a clear 
statement by participants of goals to be met within a specified time, 
schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, plan for 
achievement, and results of activities at regular intervals. The overall 
goal of the MAP and of individual participants' activities is to achieve 
additional exports of U.S. agricultural products, that is, sales that 
would not have occurred in the absence of MAP funding. A participant 
that can demonstrate additional sales compared to a representative base 
period, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the participant's 
control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need 
for evaluation.
    (ii) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and 
implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan and activity 
plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a 
participant's program, contributing to program accountability and 
providing evidence of program effectiveness.
    (iii) An MAP participant shall conduct periodic evaluations of its 
program and activities and may contract with an independent evaluator to 
satisfy this requirement. CCC reserves the right to have direct input 
and control over design, scope and methodology of any such evaluation, 
including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the 
independent evaluator.
    (2) Types of evaluation. (i) An activity evaluation is a review of 
an activity to determine whether such activity achieved the goals 
specified in the activity plan. Unless specifically exempted in the 
activity plan, all activity

[[Page 760]]

evaluations shall be completed within 90 days following the end of the 
MAP participant's activity plan year.
    (ii) A brand promotion evaluation is a review of the U.S. and 
foreign commercial entities' export sales to determine whether the 
activity achieved the goals specified in the activity plan. These 
evaluations shall be completed within 90 days following the end of the 
participant's activity plan year.
    (iii) A program evaluation is a review of the MAP participant's 
entire program or any appropriate portion of the program to determine 
the effectiveness of the participant's strategy in meeting specified 
goals. An MAP participant shall complete at least one program evaluation 
each year. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be 
determined by the MAP participant and the Division Director and 
specified in the MAP participant's activity plan approval letter.
    (3) Contents of program evaluation. A program evaluation shall 
contain:
    (i) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
    (ii) The activities covered by the evaluation (including the 
activity numbers);
    (iii) A concise statement of the constraint(s) and the goals 
specified in the activity plan;
    (iv) A description of the evaluation methodology;
    (v) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the 
ratio of additional export sales in relation to MAP funding received;
    (vi) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
    (vii) Recommendations for future programs.
    (4) An MAP participant shall submit via a cover letter to the 
Division Director, an executive summary which provides assessment of the 
program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposed changes 
in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation.
    (5) If as a result of an evaluation or audit of activities of a 
participant under the program, CCC determines that further review is 
needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 
program, CCC may require the participant to contract for an independent 
audit of the program activities,
    (d) Appeals. (1) The Director, Compliance Review Staff (Director, 
CRS) will notify a participant through a compliance report when it 
appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from that participant. 
The compliance report will state the basis for this action.
    (2) A participant may, within 60 days of the date of the compliance 
report, submit a response to the Director, CRS. The Director, CRS, at 
the Director's discretion, may extend the period for response up to an 
additional 30 days. If the participant does not respond to the 
compliance report within the required time period or, if after review of 
the participant's response, the Director, CRS, determines that CCC may 
be entitled to recover funds from the participant, the Director, CRS, 
will refer the compliance report to the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) If after review of the compliance report and response, the 
Deputy Administrator determines that the participant owes any money to 
CCC he will so inform the participant and provide the basis for the 
decision. The Deputy Administrator may initiate action to collect such 
amount pursuant to 7 C.F.R. Part 1403, Debt Settlement Policies and 
Procedures. Determinations of the Deputy Administrator will be in 
writing and in sufficient detail to inform the participant of the basis 
for the determination. The participant may request reconsideration 
within 30 days of the date of the Deputy Administrator's initial 
determination.
    (4) The Participant may appeal determinations of the Deputy 
Administrator to the Administrator. An appeal must be in writing and be 
submitted to the office of the Deputy Administrator within 30 days 
following the date of the initial determination by the Deputy 
Administrator or the determination on reconsideration. The participant 
may request a hearing.
    (5) If the participant submits its appeal and requests a hearing, 
the Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, will set a date and 
time, generally within 60 days. The hearing will be an informal 
proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless

[[Page 761]]

the participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, the 
Administrator may have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.
    (6) The Administrator will base the determination on appeal upon 
information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to 
make a determination within 60 days after submission of the appeal, 
hearing or receipt of any transcript, whichever is later. The 
determination of the Administrator will be the final determination of 
CCC. The participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained 
in this subsection before pursuing judicial review of a determination by 
the Administrator.

Corporation (CCC) nor any other agency of the United States Government 
or any official or employee of the CCC or the United States Government 
has any obligation or responsibility with respect to participant

    (2) A participant shall:
    (i) Ensure that all expenditures for goods and services reimbursed, 
in excess of $25.00, by CCC are documented by a purchase order, invoice, 
or contract and that such documentation demonstrates competition in 
acquiring the goods or services;
    (ii) Ensure that no employee or officer participates in the 
selection or award of a contract in which such employee or official, or 
the employee's or officer's family or partners has a financial interest;

Attach[eacute]/Counselor, along with an itemized inventory list and any 
documents of title.
    (2) A participant shall maintain an inventory of all capital goods 
with a value of $100 acquired in furtherance of program activities. The 
inventory shall list and number each item and include the date of 
purchase or acquisition, cost of purchase, replacement value, serial 
number, make, model, and electrical requirements.
    (3) The participant shall insure all capital goods acquired in 
furtherance of program activities and safeguard such goods against 
theft, damage and unauthorized use. The participant shall promptly 
report any loss, theft, or damage of property to the insurance company.
    (e) Contracts between MAP participants and brand participants. Where 
CCC approves an application for brand promotion, the MAP participant 
shall enter into an agreement with each approved brand participant which

    (6) Require that all product labels, promotional material and 
advertising will identify the origin of the agricultural commodity as 
``Product of the U.S.'', ``Product of the U.S.A.'', ``Grown in the 
U.S.'', ``Grown in the U.S.A.'', ``Made in America'' or other U.S. 
regional designation if approved in advance by CCC; that such origin 
identification will be conspicuously displayed, in a manner that is 
easily observed; and that such origin identification will conform, to 
the extent possible, to the U.S. standard of 1/6<gr-thn-eq> (.42 
centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter ``o''. A 
participant may request an exemption from this requirement. All such 
requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory to 
the Deputy Administrator that this labelling requirement would hinder a 
participant's promotional efforts. The Deputy Administrator will 
determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification 
exists to grant an exemption from the labelling requirement;
    (7) Specify documentation requirements for a U.S. brand applicant 
seeking priority consideration for assistance based on eligibility as a 
small-sized entity;
    (8) Require that the U.S. brand participant submit to the MAP

supplement, but not supplant, any private or third party funds or other 
contributions to program activities; and
    (9) The participant shall require the brand participant to maintain 
all original records and documents relating to program activities for 
five calendar years following the end of the applicable activity plan 
year and shall make such records and documents available upon request to 
authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
    (f) EIP/MAP participants shall ensure that all product labels, 
promotional material and advertising will identify the origin of the 
agricultural commodity as ``Product of the U.S.'', ``Product of the 
U.S.A.'', ``Grown in the U.S.'', ``Grown in the U.S.A.'', ``Made in 
America'' or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance by 
CCC; such origin identification is conspicuously displayed in a manner 
that is easily observed, and that, to the fullest extent possible, the 
origin identification conforms to the U.S. standard of 1/6<gr-thn-eq> 
(.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter ``o''. An 
EIP/ MAP participant may request an exemption from this requirement. All 
such requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory 
to the Deputy Administrator that this labelling requirement would hinder 
a participant's promotional efforts. The Deputy Administrator will 
determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification 
exists to grant an exemption from the labelling requirement;
    (g) Travel shall conform to U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR 
parts 301 through 304) and air travel shall conform to the requirements 
of the ``Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 1517).'' The MAP participant shall 
notify the Attach[eacute]/Counselor in the destination countries in 
writing in advance of any proposed travel.
    (h) Proceeds. Any income or refunds generated from an activity, 
i.e., participation fees, proceeds of sales, refunds of value added 
taxes (VAT), the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially 
reimbursed, shall be repaid by submitting a check payable to CCC or 
offsetting the participant's next reimbursement claim. However, where 
CCC reimburses a participant with CCC commodity certificates, such 
participant may retain any income generated by the sale of such 
certificates.

[67 FR 57327, Sept. 10, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 42564, July 18, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1487.2  What is the TASC program?

    Under the TASC program, CCC, an agency and instrumentality of the 
United States within the Department of Agriculture, provides funds to 
eligible organizations, on a grant basis, to implement activities that 
are intended to address a sanitary, phytosanitary, or related technical 
barrier that prohibit or threaten the export of U.S. specialty crops 
that are currently available on a commercial basis. The TASC program is 
intended to benefit the represented industry rather than a specific 
company or brand. This program is administered by FAS.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.3  What activities are eligible?

    (a) General. In order to be eligible for funding under the TASC 
program, activities must address sanitary, phytosanitary, or technical 
barriers to export of specialty crops. Examples of expenses that CCC may 
agree to cover under the TASC program include, but are not limited to: 
initial pre-clearance programs, export protocol and work plan support, 
seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest 
lists, pest and disease research, database development, reasonable 
logistical and administrative support, and travel and per diem expenses.
    (b) Location of activities. Eligible projects may take place in the 
United States or abroad.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.4  Are there any limits on the scope of proposals?

    (a) Funding cap. TASC proposals which request more than $250,000 of 
CCC funding in a given year will not be considered.
    (b) Length of activities. TASC proposals to fund activities that 
exceed three years will not be considered.
    (c) Target countries. Proposals may target all export markets, 
including single countries or reasonable regional groupings of 
countries.
    (d) Multiple proposals. Applicants may submit multiple proposals, 
but no TASC participant may have more than three approved projects 
underway at any given time.


<R05>
Sec. 1487.5  What is the process for submitting proposals?

    (a) General. Periodically the CCC will inform the public of the 
process by which interested eligible organizations

[[Page 765]]

may submit proposals for TASC program funding. This announcement will, 
among other things, include information on any deadlines for submitting 
proposals and the address of the office to which the proposals should be 
sent. The CCC also may announce the availability of a Quick Response 
Fund within the TASC program. Proposals submitted under any form of 
quick response process may be submitted at any time during the year but 
must meet the basic requirements of the program and any specific 
requirements of that particular process. Organizations interested in 
participating in the TASC program may submit their proposals 
electronically or in paper copy. Although no specific format is 
required, a sample format for proposals is available from the address 
provided in this rule.
    (b) Contents of proposals. TASC proposals must contain complete 
information about the proposed projects, including, at a minimum, the 
following:
    (1) Organizational information, including:
    (i) Organization's name, address, Chief Executive Officer (or 
designee), and Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN);
    (ii) Type of organization;
    (iii) Name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the 
primary contact person;
    (iv) A description of the organization and its membership; and
    (v) A description of the organization's experience in technical 
assistance projects, including activities involved and project results.
    (2) Project information, including:
    (i) A brief project title;
    (ii) The amount of funding requested and a justification for why 
federal funding is needed;
    (iii) Beginning and ending dates for the proposed project;
    (iv) A market assessment, including a brief description of the 
specific export barrier to be addressed by the project;
    (v) The goals of the project, and the expected benefits to the 
represented industry;
    (vi) A description of the activities planned to address the export 
barrier;
    (vii) An itemized list of all estimated costs associated with the 
project for which reimbursement will be sought; and
    (viii) Information indicating all financial and in-kind support to 
the proposed project, and the resources to be contributed by each entity 
that will contribute to the project's implementation. This may include 
the organization that submitted the proposal, private industry entities, 
host governments, foreign third parties, CCC, FAS, or other Federal 
agencies. Support may include cash, goods, and services. Although highly 
encouraged, financial support from the participant is not required.
    (3) Export information, including:
    (i) Performance measures for three years, beginning with the year 
that the project would begin, which will be used to measure the 
effectiveness of the project;
    (ii) A benchmark performance measure for the year prior to the year 
that the project would begin; and
    (iii) The viability of long-term sales to this market.

[67 FR 57327, Sept. 10, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 44564, July 18, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1487.6  What are the criteria for evaluating proposals?

    (a) Evaluation criteria. FAS will use the following criteria in 
evaluating proposals:
    (1) The nature of the specific export barrier and the extent to 
which the proposal is likely to successfully remove, resolve, or 
mitigate that barrier;
    (2) The potential trade impact of the proposed project on market 
retention, market access, and market expansion, including the potential 
for expanding commercial sales in the targeted market;
    (3) The completeness and viability of the proposal;
    (4) The ability of the organization to provide an experienced staff 
with the requisite technical and trade experience to execute the 
proposal;
    (5) The extent to which the proposal is targeted to a market in 
which the United States is generally competitive;
    (6) The cost of the project and the amount of other resources 
dedicated to the project, including cash and goods

[[Page 766]]

and services of the U.S. industry and foreign third parties;
    (7) The degree to which time is essential to addressing specific 
export barriers;
    (8) In cases where the CCC receives multiple proposals from 
different applicants which address essentially the same barrier, the 
nature of the applicant organization will be taken into consideration, 
with a greater weight given to those organizations with the broadest 
base of producer representation.
    (b) Evaluation process. FAS will review proposals for eligibility 
and will evaluate each proposal against the factors described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The purpose of this review is to identify 
meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each 
proposal based upon these factors, and submit the proposals and funding 
recommendations to the Deputy Administrator, Commodity and Marketing 
Programs. FAS may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the 
proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. government experts in 
evaluating the merits of a proposal.

[67 FR 57327, Sept. 10, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 42564, July 18, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1487.7  How are agreements formalized?

    Following the approval of a proposal, the CCC will enter into a 
written agreement with the organization that submitted the proposal. 
This program agreement will incorporate the proposal as approved by the 
FAS, include a maximum dollar amount that may be reimbursed (the funding 
level), and identify terms and conditions under which the CCC will 
reimburse certain costs of the project. Program agreements also will 
outline any specific responsibilities of the participant, including, but 
not limited to, the timely and effective implementation of program 
activities and the submission of a written report(s), on no less than an 
annual basis, which evaluates the TASC project using the performance 
measures presented in the approved proposal.

[68 FR 42564, July 18, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1487.8  How are payments made?

    (a) Reimbursement. (1) Following the implementation of a project for 
which the CCC has agreed to provide funding, a participant may submit 
claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses to the extent that the CCC 
has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must 
be approved in writing by the FAS before any reimbursable expenses 
associated with the change can be incurred. A participant will be 
reimbursed after the CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is 
complete.
    (2) All claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90 
calendar days following the expiration or termination date of the 
program agreement. For program agreements which extend beyond twelve 
months, all claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90 
calendar days following the next anniversary of the effective date of 
the agreement.
    (3) Participants shall maintain complete records of all program 
expenditures, identified by TASC agreement number, program year, country 
or region, activity number and cost category. Such records shall be 
accompanied by original documentation which supports the expenditure and 
shall be made available to the FAS upon request.
    (4) Participants shall maintain all records and documents relating 
to TASC projects, including the original documentation which supports 
reimbursement claims, for a period of three calendar years following the 
expiration or termination date of the program agreement. Such records 
and documents will be subject to verification by the FAS Compliance 
Review Staff and shall be made available upon request to authorized 
officials of the U.S. Government. The FAS may deny a claim for 
reimbursement if the claim is not supported by acceptable documentation.
    (5) In the event that a reimbursement claim is overpaid or is 
disallowed after payment already has been made, the participant shall 
return the overpayment amount or the disallowed amount to the CCC within 
30 days after realizing the overpayment or receiving notification of the 
overpayment or disallowed amount.

[[Page 767]]

    (b) Advances. Participants may request advances of funds, not to 
exceed 85 percent of the funding approved in any given program year. All 
advanced funds must be either fully expended or the balance returned by 
check made payable to the CCC no later than the 90th calendar day 
following the date of disbursement of the advance to the participant. 
Upon the expenditure of advance funds, participants must submit 
reimbursement claims to offset the advance charged to them.
    (c) Interest. Participants shall deposit and maintain advanced funds 
in insured, interest-bearing accounts. Interest earned on outstanding 
advances must be returned by check made payable to the CCC at the time 
the advance is either fully expended or itself returned.

financing

[[Page 774]]

agreement, the exporter shall furnish to the office specified in Sec. 
1488.22, documentary evidence verifying entry of the commodity into the 
country of destination specified in the financing agreement. The 
documentary evidence must:
    (1) Identify the agricultural commodity (or permit identification

<R05>
Sec. 1488.11  Liquidated damages.

    Failure of the exporter to export or cause to be exported, within 
the period provided therefor, any agricultural commodity financed, when 
delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing 
agreement, or failure of the exporter to enter or cause the entry of, 
such commodity into the country of destination, shall constitute a 
breach of the financing agreement which will result in serious and 
substantial damage to CCC and to its program. Since it will be 
difficult, if not impossible, to prove the exact amount of such damage, 
the exporter shall pay to CCC promptly on demand, as reasonable 
compensation and not as a penalty, liquidated damages in lieu of 
probable actual damages, as follows:
    (a) For each day of delay in exportation after the final date for 
exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the 
financing agreement, .15 percent of the amount financed under the 
financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (b) for failure to 
export or cause exportation, when delivery is made before export under 
the terms of the financing agreement, 5 percent of the amount financed 
under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (c) for 
failure, after exportation, to enter or cause the entry of the commodity 
into the country of destination, at the rate of 5 percent a year of the 
amount financed under the financing agreement for such commodity from 
the start of the financing period until payment to CCC of the amount 
financed; Provided however, That the aggregate of all amounts assessed 
under this Sec. 1488.11 with respect to the same commodity shall not 
exceed 5 percent of the amount financed for such commodity. Liquidated 
damages shall not be assessed: Under paragraph (a) of this section if 
the Assistant Sales manager determines that the delay was due to such 
causes as acts of God or government or public enemy, fires, floods, 
epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, or 
unusually severe weather; under paragraph (b) of this section if the 
Assistant Sales

Manager determines that failure to export was due to loss, damage, 
destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of God or 
government or public enemy; and under paragraph (c) of this section if 
the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to enter or cause 
the entry of the commodity into the country of destination was due to 
loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of 
God or government or public enemy.

                     Bank Obligations and Repayment


<R05>
Sec. 1488.12  Coverage of bank obligations.

    (a) U.S. banks and branch banks shall be liable without regard to 
risk (1) for payment of bank obligations issued by them or (2) for 
payment of bank obligations confirmed by them without regard to risk if 
a requirement for such confirmation is included in the financing 
agreement or (3) as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (b) An obligation issued by a foreign bank must be confirmed and 
advised, as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this 
section, by a U.S. bank or a branch bank, or may be confirmed by an 
agency bank when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC 
after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of 
CCC.
    (c) A U.S. bank must confirm the full amount of an obligation issued 
by its foreign branch. CCC will hold the U.S. bank liable for payment 
without regard to risks.
    (d) If a branch bank confirms an obligation issued by its home 
office, or by another branch of its home office, it must confirm the 
full amount thereof. CCC will hold the branch bank liable for payment 
without regard to risks.
    (e) If CCC accepts an agency bank confirmation of a foreign bank 
obligation, it must be for the full amount thereof without regard to 
risks and will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be 
contained in the financing agreement. CCC will not accept an agency bank 
confirmation of an obligation issued by its home office, or by a branch 
of its home office.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this 
section, if a U.S. bank or a branch bank confirms an obligation issued 
by a foreign bank, it must confirm at least 10 percent pro rata and must 
advise the remainder of the foreign bank obligation. The percentage of 
confirmation shall be the same for both the account receivable and the 
interest portions of the obligation. For the confirmed amount, except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, CCC will hold the U.S. 
bank or branch bank liable for commercial risks but not for non-
commercial risks. For the advised amount, CCC will not hold the U.S. 
bank or branch bank liable for commercial or non-commercial risks. CCC 
will hold the foreign bank liable without regard to risks for all 
amounts not recovered from the U.S. or branch bank.
    (g) Under special circumstances, on application in writing, the Vice 
President, CCC, may reduce or waive requirements for 10 percent 
confirmation by a U.S. or branch bank, but a bank will not be relieved 
of any obligation it undertakes.
    (h) Any bank obligation which provides for a bank acceptance of a 
time draft by CCC (banker's acceptance) shall not be acceptable to CCC.
    (i) CCC will consent to cancellation or reduction of a bank 
obligation to the extent of any payment it receives from other sources 
or amounts otherwise payable under such bank obligation.
    (j) Collection of accounts receivable purchased under GSM-5 will be 
effected through the issuance by CCC of sight drafts against the bank 
obligations, but this method of collection shall not be exclusive of any 
other collection procedures or rights available to CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1488.13  CCC drafts.

    CCC will draw one draft for each payment due under bank obligations. 
If any portion of a CCC draft is dishonored, the U.S. bank or branch 
bank shall return the dishonored draft together with its statement of 
the reason for nonpayment. If a draft which is drawn under a partially 
confirmed bank obligation is dishonored, CCC will replace the draft with 
separate drafts

[[Page 776]]

for the confirmed and unconfirmed portions at the request of the 
confirming bank. Such replacement shall not alter the confirming bank's 
obligation for timely payment to CCC of the confirmed portion of the 
credit. For confirmed amounts, except as provided in Sec. 1488.12(a), 
(c) and (d), a U.S. or branch bank may request refund from CCC of the 
amount paid if it certifies to CCC that it is unable to recover funds 
from the foreign bank due to a stipulated non-commercial risk which 
existed on the date payment was made to CCC under the draft. If CCC 
finds that inability to recover funds was due to such a non-commercial 
risk, the refund shall be promptly made together with interest at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York discount rate from and including the 
date payment was originally made to CCC but not include the date of 
refund by CCC. For unconfirmed amounts, remittance to CCC shall be 
considered final, and the U.S. bank or branch bank shall not thereafter 
have recourse to CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1488.14  Interest charges.

    The account receivable assigned to CCC and the related bank 
obligation(s) shall bear interest as specified in this section. Rates of 
interest applicable to financing agreements shall be published in USDA 
announcement. The interest rate applicable to that portion of an account 
receivable for which payment is assured by a bank obligation issued or 
confirmed for all risks according to Sec. 1488.12(a)(ii) or pro rata 
confirmed by a U.S. bank shall be lower than the interest rate 
applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest 
rate applicable to that portion of an account receivable the payment of 
which is assured by a bank obligation issued or pro rata confirmed by a 
branch bank shall, when determined by the President or Vice President, 
CCC after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest 
of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of 
the account receivable. The interest rates applicable to accounts 
receivable the payment of which is assured by an agency bank 
confirmation may, when determined by the President or Vice President, 
CCC, after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest 
of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of 
the account receivable. The interest rate applicable will be the rate in 
effect on the date CCC receives the sale registration request under 
Sec. 1488.4. Interest shall accrue on the account receivable from the 
date of delivery or the weighted average delivery date of the 
agricultural commodities delivered under the financing agreement to the 
date of payment, or to the date of expiration of the financing period, 
or to the date of expiration of the bank obligation, whichever occurs 
first, and shall be payable as specified in the financing agreement. 
Thereafter, interest shall accrue on any unpaid part of both the 
principal and interest due as of such expiration date.

[42 FR 10999, Feb. 25, 1977, as amended at 42 FR 27569, May 31, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.15  Advance payment.

    If, before expiration of the financing period, the exporter or the 
U.S. bank or the agency or branch bank accepts payment from or on behalf 
of the foreign importer of any part of the account receivable, it shall 
be remitted promptly to CCC. Such prepayment shall be applied first to 
interest on the unpaid balance of the account receivable to the date CCC 
receives such prepayment and then to the principal.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.16  Liability for payment.

    If delivery is made within the coverage of the bank obligation(s) 
submitted in accordance with Sec. 1488.8, CCC will look to the 
obligating bank or banks and the foreign importer, rather than to the 
exporter or intervening purchaser, for payment of all amounts due at 
maturity of the account receivable and of the bank obligation(s), but 
the exporter and the intervening purchaser shall remain liable for any 
loss arising from breach of any contractual obligation, certification or 
warranty made by them pursuant to the financing agreement, and the 
exporter shall remain liable for any amounts not covered by the bank 
obligation which are owing to CCC, and any remittance or

[[Page 777]]

refund required by Sec. 1488.15 and Sec. 1488.18, together with 
interest thereon at the rate specified in the documents evidencing the 
account receivable, as well as for any liquidated damages provided for 
in Sec. 1488.11. The liability of the bank and the importer under their 
respective obligations shall be several.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1488.17  Assignment.

    The exporter shall not assign any claim or rights or any amounts 
payable under the financing agreement, in whole or in part, without 
written approval of the Vice President, CCC, or the Controller, CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.18  Covenant against contingent fees.

    The exporter warrants that no person or selling agency has been 
employed or retained to solicit or secure the financing agreement on an 
agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or 
contingent fee, except bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty, 
CCC shall have the right, without limitation on any other rights it may 
have, to annul the financing agreement without liability to CCC. Should 
the financing agreement be annulled, CCC will promptly consent to the 
reduction or cancellation or related bank obligations except for amounts 
outstanding under a financing agreement. Such amounts shall, on demand, 
be refunded to CCC by the exporter.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.19  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.20  Officials not to benefit.

    No member of or delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, 
shall be admitted to any share or part of the financing agreement or to 
any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this provision shall not be 
construed to extend to the financing agreement if made with a 
corporation for its general benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.21  Exporter's records and accounts.

    CCC shall have access to and the right to examine any directly 
pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the exporter involving 
transactions related to the financed export credit sale until the 
expiration of three years after the end of the financing period.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.22  Communications.

    (a) Unless otherwise provided, written requests, notifications, or 
communications by the applicant pertaining to the financing agreement 
shall be addressed to the Assistant Sales Manager, Commercial Export 
Programs, Office of the General Sales Manager, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

    (10) Provide leadership for establishing, implementing, and 
overseeing administrative processes for easements, easement payments, 
and administrative and financial performance reporting.
    (c) NRCS may enter into cooperative agreements with eligible 
entities to assist NRCS with implementation of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.3  Definitions.

    The following definitions may be applicable to this part:
    Agricultural uses are defined by the State's Purchase of Development 
Rights (PDR) program, or where no PDR program exists, agricultural uses 
should be defined by the State agricultural use assessment program. (If 
the Agency finds that a State definition of agriculture is so broad that 
an included use could lead to the degradation of soils, NRCS reserves 
the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property than 
allowable under that State definition of agriculture in order to protect 
topsoil.)
    Chief means the Chief of NRCS, USDA.
    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a Government-owned and 
operated entity that was created to stabilize, support, and protect farm 
income and prices. CCC is managed by a Board of Directors, subject to 
the general supervision and direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, 
who is an ex-officio director and chairperson of the Board. CCC provides 
the funding for FRPP, and NRCS administers FRPP on its behalf.
    Conservation Easement means a voluntary, legally recorded 
restriction, in the form of a deed, on the use of property, in order to 
protect resources such as agricultural lands, historic structures, open 
space, and wildlife habitat.
    Conservation Plan is the document that--
    (1) Applies to highly erodible cropland;

[[Page 779]]

    (2) Describes the conservation system applicable to the highly 
erodible cropland and describes the decisions of the person with respect 
to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment 
measures and schedules;
    (3) Is approved by the local soil conservation district in 
consultation with the local committees established under Section 8(b)(5) 
of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 
5909h(b)(5)) and the Secretary, or by the Secretary.
    Contingent right is an interest in land held by the United States, 
which the United States may exercise under specific circumstances in 
order to enforce the terms of the conservation easement or hold title to 
the easement.
    Eligible entities means Federally recognized Indian Tribes, States, 
units of local government, and certain non-governmental organizations, 
which have a farmland protection program that purchases agricultural 
conservation easements for the purpose of protecting topsoil by limiting 
conversion to non-agricultural uses of the land.
    Additionally, to be eligible for FRPP, the entity must have pending 
offers, for acquiring conservation easements for the purpose of 
protecting agricultural land from conversion to non-agricultural uses.
    Eligible land is privately owned land on a farm or ranch that has 
prime, unique, Statewide, or locally important soil, or contains 
historical or archaeological resources, and is subject to a pending 
offer by an eligible entity. Eligible land includes cropland, rangeland, 
grassland, and pasture land, as well as forest land that is an 
incidental part of an agricultural operation. Other incidental land that 
would not otherwise be eligible, but when considered as part of a 
pending offer, may be considered eligible, if inclusion of such land 
would significantly augment protection of the associated farm or ranch 
land.
    Fair market value is ascertained through standard real property 
appraisal methods. Fair market value is the amount in cash, for which in 
all probability the property would have sold on the effective date of 
the appraisal, after a reasonable exposure of time on the open 
competitive market, from a willing and reasonably knowledgeable seller 
to a willing and reasonably knowledgeable buyer. Neither the seller nor 
the buyer act under any compulsion to buy or sell, giving due 
consideration to all available economic uses of the property at the time 
of the appraisal. In valuing conservation easements, the appraiser 
estimates both the fair market value of the whole property before the 
easement acquisition and the fair market value of the remainder property 
after the conservation easement has been imposed. The difference between 
these two values is deemed the value of the conservation easement.
    Farm or Ranch Succession Plan is a general plan to address the 
continuation of some type of agricultural business on the conserved 
land; the farm or ranch succession plan may include specific intra-
family succession agreements or strategies to address business asset 
transfer planning to create opportunities for beginning farmers and 
ranchers.
    Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) is the official document for 
NRCS guidelines, criteria, and standards for planning and applying 
conservation treatments and conservation management systems. The FOTG 
contains detailed information on the conservation of soil, water, air, 
plant, and animal resources applicable to the local area for which it is 
prepared.
    Historical and archaeological resources must be:
    (1) Listed in the National Register of Historic Places (established 
under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 16 U.S.C. 470, et 
seq.), or
    (2) Formally determined eligible for listing in the National 
Register of Historic Places (by the State Historic Preservation Officer 
(SHPO) or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) and the Keeper of 
the National Register in accordance with section 106 of the NHPA), or
    (3) Formally listed in the State or Tribal Register of Historic 
Places of the SHPO (designated under section 101 (b)(1)(B) of the NHPA) 
or the THPO (designated under section 101(d)(1)(C) of the NHPA).
    Land Evaluation and Site Assessment System (LESA) is the land 
evaluation

[[Page 780]]

system approved by the NRCS State Conservationist used to rank land for 
farm and ranch land protection purposes, based on soil potential for 
agriculture, as well as social and economic factors, such as location, 
access to markets, and adjacent land use. (For additional information 
see the Farmland Protection Policy Act rule at 7 CFR part 658.)
    Landowner means a person, persons, estate, corporation, or other 
business or nonprofit entity having fee title ownership of farm or ranch 
land.
    Natural Resources Conservation Service is an agency of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.
    Non-governmental organization is defined as any organization that:
    (1) Is organized for, and at all times since the formation of the 
organization, has been operated principally for one or more of the 
conservation purposes specified in clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of 
section 170(h)(4)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
    (2) Is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of that Code 
that is exempt from taxation under 501(a) of that Code;
    (3) Is described in section 509(a)(2) of that Code; or
    (4) Is described in section 509(a)(3) of that Code and is controlled 
by an organization described in section 509(a)(2) of that Code.
    Other interests in land include any right in real property 
recognized by State law, including fee title. FRPP funds will only be 
used to purchase other interests in land with prior approval from the 
Chief.
    Other productive soils are soils that are contained on farm or ranch 
land that is identified as farmland of Statewide or local importance and 
is used for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, or oilseed 
crops. The appropriate State or local government agency determines 
Statewide or locally important farmland with concurrence from the State 
Conservationist. Generally, these farmlands produce high yields of crops 
when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. In 
some States and localities, farmlands of Statewide and local importance 
may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by 
State law or local ordinance. 7 CFR part 657 sets forth the process for 
designating soils as Statewide or locally important.
    Pending offer is a written bid, contract, or option extended to a 
landowner by an eligible entity to acquire a conservation easement 
before the legal title to these rights has been conveyed for the purpose 
of limiting non-agricultural uses of the land.
    Prime and unique farmland are defined separately, as follows:
    (1) Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical 
and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, fiber, forage, 
oilseed, and other agricultural crops with minimum inputs of fuel, 
fertilizer, pesticides, and labor, without intolerable soil erosion, as 
determined by the Secretary.
    (2) Unique farmland is land other than prime farmland that is used 
for the production of specific high-value food and fiber crops, as 
determined by the Secretary. It has the special combination of soil 
quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to 
economically produce sustained high quality or high yields of specific 
crops when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. 
Examples of such crops include citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries, 
fruits, and vegetables. Additional information on the definition of 
prime, unique, or other productive soil can be found in 7 CFR part 657 
and 7 CFR part 658.
    Secretary is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    State Technical Committee means a committee established by the 
Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in a State pursuant to 
16 U.S.C. 3861 and 7 CFR part 610, subpart C.
    State Conservationist means the NRCS employee authorized to direct 
and supervise NRCS activities in a State, the Caribbean Area (Puerto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands), or the Pacific Basin Area (Guam, American 
Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands).


<R05>
Sec. 1491.4  Program requirements.

    (a) Under the FRPP, the Secretary, on behalf of CCC, shall purchase 
conservation easements, in partnership

[[Page 781]]

with eligible entities, from landowners who voluntarily wish to protect 
their farm and ranch lands from conversion to nonagricultural uses. 
Eligible entities submit applications to NRCS State Offices to partner 
with NRCS to acquire conservation easements on farm and ranch land. NRCS 
enters into cooperative agreements with selected entities and provides 
funds for up to 50 percent of the appraised market value for the 
easement purchase. In return, the entity agrees to acquire, hold, 
manage, and enforce the easement. A Federal contingent right interest in 
the property must be included in each easement deed for the protection 
of the Federal investment.
    (b) The term of all easements will be in perpetuity unless 
prohibited by State law.
    (c) To be eligible to receive FRPP funding, an entity must meet the 
definition of ``eligible entity'' as listed in Sec. 1491.3. In 
addition, eligible entities wishing to receive FRPP funds must also 
demonstrate:
    (1) A commitment to long-term conservation of agricultural lands;
    (2) A capability to acquire, manage, and enforce easements;
    (3) Sufficient number of staff dedicated to monitoring and easement 
stewardship; and
    (4) The availability of funds.
    (d) Eligible land must meet the definition of ``eligible land'' as 
provided in Sec. 1491.3. In addition:
    (1) Entire farms or ranches may be enrolled in FRPP.
    (2) Farms must contain at least 50 percent of prime, unique, 
Statewide, or locally important soil, unless otherwise determined by the 
State Conservationist, or contain historical or archaeological 
resources.
    (3) Eligible lands are farm and ranch lands subject to a pending 
offer, as defined in Sec. 1491.3, for purchase of a conservation 
easement.
    (4) Eligible land must be privately owned. NRCS will not enroll land 
in FRPP that is owned in fee title by an agency of the United States or 
State or local government, or land that is already subject to an 
easement or deed restriction that limits the conversion of the land to 
nonagricultural use, unless otherwise determined by the Secretary.
    (5) Eligible land must be owned by landowners who certify that they 
do not exceed the adjusted gross income limitation eligibility 
requirements set forth in Section 1604 of the Farm Security and Rural 
Investment Act of 2002.
    (e) Prior to FRPP fund disbursement, the value of the conservation 
easement must be appraised. Appraisals shall be completed and signed by 
a State-certified or licensed general appraiser and shall contain a 
disclosure statement by the appraiser. The appraisal shall conform to 
either the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices or the 
Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions.
    (f) At the discretion of the Chief, a standard easement or 
equivalent legal form, which meets the intent of the 2002 Act, will be 
required as a condition for program participation.
    (g) The landowner shall be responsible for complying with the Highly 
Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation provisions of the Food Security 
Act of 1985, as amended, and 7 CFR part 12.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.5  Application procedures.

    (a) When funds are available, NRCS publishes a Request for Proposals 
in the Federal Register or, at the discretion of the Chief, uses another 
process to solicit applications from eligible entities to cooperate in 
the acquisition of conservation easements on farms and ranches. 
Information required in the application will be set forth in the Request 
for Proposals.
    (b) To participate, an eligible entity submits a proposal to NRCS 
for the acquisition of conservation easements on eligible farm or ranch 
land, on which the entity already has pending offers. An entity's 
application contains a request to fund one or more parcels. All 
applications must be submitted to the appropriate NRCS State 
Conservationist by the specified date, as indicated in the Request for 
Proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.6  Ranking considerations and proposal selection.

    (a) Once the NRCS State Conservationist has assessed entity 
eligibility

[[Page 782]]

and land eligibility, the State Conservationist shall use National and 
State criteria to evaluate the land and rank parcels. Entities and 
parcels will be selected for participation based on the entities' 
responses to the Request for Proposals. Selection will be based on 
national ranking criteria set forth by the Chief in the Request for 
Proposals and State criteria as determined by the State Conservationist, 
with advice from the State Technical Committee.
    (1) Examples of national criteria may include:
    (i) Acreage of prime, unique, and important farm and ranch land to 
be protected;

<R05>
Sec. 1491.7  Funding priorities.

    (a) NRCS will only consider funding the acquisition of eligible land 
in the Program if the agricultural viability of the land can be 
demonstrated. For example, the land must be of sufficient size and have 
boundaries that allow for efficient management of the area. The land 
must also have access to markets for its products and a support 
infrastructure appropriate for agricultural production.
    (b) NRCS may not fund the acquisition of eligible lands if NRCS 
determines that the protection provided by the FRPP would not be 
effective because of on-site or off-site conditions.
    (c) NRCS will place a higher priority on easements acquired by 
entities that

[[Page 783]]

have extensive experience in managing and enforcing easements.
    (d) During the application period, pending offers having appraisals 
completed and signed by State-certified general appraisers within the 
preceding one year shall receive higher funding priority by the NRCS 
State Conservationist. Before funding is released for easement 
acquisition, the cooperating entity must provide NRCS with a copy of the 
certified appraisal.
    (e) NRCS may place a higher priority on lands and locations that 
help create a large tract of protected area for viable agricultural 
production and that are under increasing urban development pressure(s).
    (f) NRCS may place a higher priority on lands and locations that 
link to other Federal, Tribal, or State governments or non-governmental 
organization efforts with complementary farmland protection objectives 
(e.g. open space, watershed and wildlife habitat protection).
    (g) NRCS may place a higher priority on lands that provide 
multifunctional benefits including social, economic, historical and 
archaeological, and environmental benefits.
    (h) NRCS may place a higher priority on certain geographic regions 
where the enrollment of particular lands may help achieve National, 
State, and regional goals and objectives, or enhance existing government 
or private conservation projects.
    (i) NRCS may place a higher priority on farms or ranches that have 
or will have a greater variety of natural resources protected.
    (j) NRCS may place a higher priority on farms or ranches that have a 
farm succession plan or similar plan established to encourage farm 
viability for future generations.
    (k) NRCS may place a higher priority on the national ranking 
criteria listed in Sec. 1491.6(a)(1) than State criteria, if the NRCS 
Chief deems appropriate.


<R04>
    Subpart B_Cooperative Agreements and Conservation Easement Deeds


<R05>
Sec. 1491.20  Cooperative agreements.

    (a) NRCS, on behalf of CCC, enters into a cooperative agreement with 
those entities selected for funding awards. Once a proposal is selected 
by the State Conservationist, the entity must work with the appropriate 
State Conservationist to finalize and sign the cooperative agreement 
incorporating all necessary FRPP requirements. The cooperative agreement 
addresses:
    (1) The interests in land to be acquired, including the form of the 
easements to be used and terms and conditions;
    (2) The management and enforcement of the rights acquired;
    (3) The role of NRCS;
    (4) The responsibilities of the easement manager on lands acquired 
with the assistance of FRPP; and
    (5) Other requirements deemed necessary by NRCS to protect the 
interests of the United States.
    (b) The cooperative agreement will also include an attachment 
listing the parcels accepted by the State Conservationist, landowners' 
names, addresses, location map(s), and other relevant information. An 
example of a cooperative agreement may be obtained from the State 
Conservationist.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.21  Funding.

    (a) The State Conservationist, in coordination with the cooperating 
entity, shall determine the NRCS share of the cost of purchasing a 
conservation easement.
    (b) Under the FRPP, NRCS may provide up to 50 percent of the 
appraised fair market value of the conservation easement. Entities are 
required to supplement the NRCS share of the cost of the conservation 
easement.
    (c) Landowner donations up to 25 percent of the appraised fair 
market value of the conservation easement may be considered part of the 
entity's matching offer.
    (d) For the entity, two cost-share options are available when 
providing its matching offer.
    (1) The entity may provide in cash at least 25 percent of the 
appraised fair market value of the conservation easement, or
    (2) The entity may provide at least 50 percent of the purchase price 
in cash, of the conservation easement. This second option may be 
preferable to an entity in the case of a large bargain sale

[[Page 784]]

by the landowner. If this option is selected, the NRCS share cannot 
exceed the entity's contribution.
    (e) FRPP funds may not be used for expenditures such as appraisals, 
surveys, title insurance, legal fees, costs of easement monitoring, and 
other related administrative and transaction costs incurred by the 
entity.
    (f) If the State Conservationist determines that the purchase of two 
or more conservation easements are comparable in achieving FRPP goals, 
the State Conservationist shall not assign a higher priority to any one 
of these conservation easements based on lesser cost to FRPP.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.22  Conservation easement deeds.

    (a) Under FRPP, a landowner grants an easement to an eligible entity 
with which NRCS has entered into an FRPP cooperative agreement. The 
easement shall require that the easement area be maintained in 
accordance with FRPP goals and objectives for the term of the easement.
    (b) Pending offers by an eligible entity must be for acquiring an 
easement in perpetuity, except where State law prohibits a permanent 
easement.
    (c) The conveyance document or conservation easement deed used by 
the eligible entity may be reviewed and approved by the NRCS National 
Office and Office of the General Counsel (OGC) before being recorded.
    (d) Since title to the easement is held by an entity other than the 
United States, the conveyance document must contain a ``contingent 
right'' clause that provides that all rights conveyed by the landowner 
under the document will become vested in the United States should the 
eligible entity (i.e., the grantee[s]) abandon or attempt to terminate 
the conservation easement. In addition, the contingent right also 
provides, in part, that the Secretary takes title to the easement, if 
the eligible entity fails to uphold the easement or attempts to transfer 
the easement without first securing the consent of the Secretary.
    (e) As a condition for participation, a conservation plan will be 
developed by NRCS in consultation with the landowner and implemented 
according to the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide and approved by the 
local conservation district. The conservation plan will be developed and 
managed in accordance with the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 7 
CFR part 12 or subsequent regulations, and other requirements as 
determined by the State Conservationist. To ensure compliance with this 
conservation plan, the easement will grant to the United States, through 
NRCS, its successors or assigns, a right of access to the easement area.
    (f) The cooperating entity shall acquire, hold, manage and enforce 
the easement. The cooperating entity may have the option to enter into 
an agreement with governmental or private organizations to carry out 
easement stewardship responsibilities if approved by NRCS.
    (g) Prior to fund disbursement, NRCS must sign the conservation 
easement, concurring with the terms of the conservation easement and 
accepting its interest in the conservation easement deed.
    (h) All conservation easement deeds acquired with FRPP funds must be 
recorded. Proof of recordation shall be provided to NRCS by the 
cooperating entity.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.23  Easement modifications.

    (a) After an easement has been recorded, no amendments to the 
easement will be made without prior approval by NRCS State 
Conservationist and the USDA Office of General Counsel.
    (b) Easement modifications will be approved only when easement is 
duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real estate 
practices, including requirements for title approval, subordination of 
liens, and recordation, and when the amendment is consistent with the 
purposes of the conservation easement.


<R04>
                    Subpart C_General Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1491.30  Violations and remedies.

    (a) In the event of a violation of the terms of the easement, the 
cooperating entity shall notify the landowner. The

[[Page 785]]

landowner may be given reasonable notice and, where appropriate, an 
opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation in accordance with the 
terms of the conservation easement.
    (b) In the event that the cooperating entity fails to enforce any of 
the terms of the easement as determined in the sole discretion of the 
Secretary, the Secretary and his or her successors and assigns shall 
have the right to enforce the terms of the easement through any and all 
authorities available under Federal or State law. In the event that the 
cooperating entity attempts to terminate, transfer, or otherwise divest 
itself of any rights, title, or interests of the easement or extinguish 
the easement or without the prior consent of the Secretary and payment 
of consideration to the United States, then, at the option of the 
Secretary, all right, title, and interest in the conservation easement 
shall become vested in the United States of America.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, NRCS, upon 
notification to the landowner, reserves the right to enter upon the 
easement area at any time to monitor conservation plan implementation or 
remedy deficiencies or easement violations, as it relates to the 
conservation plan. The entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when 
the actions are deemed necessary to protect highly erodible soils and 
wetland resources. The landowner will be liable for any costs incurred 
by the United States as a result of the landowner's negligence or 
failure to comply with the easement requirements as it relates to 
conservation plan violations.
    (d) The United States shall be entitled to recover any and all 
administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, 
associated with any enforcement or remedial action as it relates to the 
enforcement of the FRPP easement.
    (e) The conservation easement shall include an indemnification 
clause requiring landowners to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the 
United States from any liability resulting from the negligent acts of 
the landowner.
    (f) In instances where an easement is terminated or extinguished, 
NRCS will collect CCC's share of the conservation easement based on the 
appraised fair market value of the conservation easement at the time the 
easement is extinguished or terminated. CCC's share shall be in 
proportion to its percentage of original investment.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.31  Appeals.

    (a) A person or cooperating entity which has submitted an FRPP 
proposal and is therefore participating in FRPP may obtain a review of 
any administrative determination concerning eligibility for 
participation utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided 
in 7 CFR part 614.
    (b) Before a person may seek judicial review of any action taken 
under this part, the person must exhaust all administrative appeal 
procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and for the 
purposes of judicial review, no decision shall be a final agency action 
except a decision of the U. S. Department of Agriculture under these 
provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 1491.32  Scheme or device.

    (a) If it is determined by the Secretary that a cooperating entity 
has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any 
part of any program payment otherwise due or paid such a cooperating 
entity during the applicable period may be withheld or be required to be 
refunded with interest thereon, as determined appropriate by CCC.
    (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, 
fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person or entity of 
payments for easements for the purpose of obtaining a payment to which a 
person would otherwise not be entitled.

<R04>
Subpart A_Restrictions and Criteria for Export Credit Guarantee Programs


<R05>
Sec. 1493.1  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the restrictions which apply to the use of 
credit guarantees under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export 
Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate Credit Guarantee 
Program (GSM-103) and the criteria considered by CCC in determining the 
annual allocations of credit guarantees to be made available with 
respect to each participating country. This subpart also sets forth the 
criteria considered by CCC in the review and approval of proposed 
allocation levels for GSM-102 and/or GSM-103 credit guarantees which may 
be made available in connection with export sales of specific U.S. 
agricultural commodities to these countries. These restrictions and 
criteria are interrelated and will be applied and considered together in 
the process of determining which sales opportunities under GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 will best meet the purposes of the programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.2  Purposes of programs.

    CCC may use export credit guarantees:
    (a) To increase exports of U.S. agricultural commodities;
    (b) To compete against foreign agricultural exports;
    (c) To assist countries, particularly developing countries, in 
meeting their food and fiber needs; and
    (d) For such other purposes as the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines appropriate, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 1493.6.

[[Page 787]]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.3  Restrictions on programs and cargo preference statement.

    (a) Restrictions on use of credit guarantees. (1) Export credit 
guarantees authorized under these regulations shall not be used for 
foreign aid, foreign policy, or debt rescheduling purposes.
    (2) CCC shall not make credit guarantees available in connection 
with sales of agricultural commodities to any country that the Secretary 
determines cannot adequately service the debt associated with such 
sales.
    (b) Cargo preference laws. The provisions of the cargo preference 
laws shall not apply to export sales with respect to which credit is 
guaranteed under these programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.4  Criteria for country allocations.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for country 
allocations under the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programs, will include, but not 
be limited to, the following:
    (a) Potential benefits that the extension of export credit 
guarantees would provide for the development, expansion or maintenance 
of the market for particular U.S. agricultural commodities in the 
importing country;
    (b) Financial and economic ability of the importing country to 
adequately service CCC guaranteed debt;
    (c) Financial status of participating banks in the importing country 
as it would affect their ability to adequately service CCC guaranteed 
debt;
    (d) Political stability of the importing country as it would affect 
its ability to adequately service CCC guaranteed debt; and
    (e) Current status of debt either owed by the importing country to 
CCC or to lenders protected by CCC's guarantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.5  Criteria for agricultural commodity allocations.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for specific 
U.S. commodity allocations within a specific country allocation will 
include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) Potential benefits that the extension of export credit 
guarantees would provide for the development, expansion or maintenance 
of the market in the importing country for the particular U.S. 
agricultural commodity under consideration;
    (b) The best use to be made of the export credit guarantees in 
assisting the importing country in meeting its particular needs for food 
and fiber, as may be determined through consultations with private 
buyers and/or representatives of the government of the importing 
country;
    (c) Evaluation, in terms of program purposes, of the relative 
benefits of providing payment guarantee coverage for sales of the U.S. 
agricultural commodity under consideration compared to providing 
coverage for sales of other U.S. agricultural commodities; and
    (d) Evaluation of the near and long term potential for sales on a 
cash basis of the U.S. commodity under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.6  Additional required determinations for GSM-103.

    Notwithstanding any other provision under this part, CCC shall not 
guarantee under the GSM-103 program the repayment of credit made 
available to finance an export sale unless the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines that such sale will:
    (a) Develop, expand or maintain the importing country as a foreign 
market, on a long-term basis, for the commercial sale and export of U.S. 
agricultural commodities, without displacing normal commercial sales;
    (b) Improve the capability of the importing country to purchase or 
use, on a long-term basis, U.S. agricultural commodities; or
    (c) Otherwise promote the export of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R04>
    Subpart B_CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and CCC 
    Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) Operations


<R05>
Sec. 1493.10  General statement.

    (a) Overview. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing 
the operations of the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the 
Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103). The GSM-102 and GSM-103 
programs of the Commodity Credit

[[Page 788]]

Corporation (CCC) were developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by 
making available export credit guarantees to encourage U.S. private 
sector financing of foreign purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities 
on credit terms. Under GSM-102, credit guarantees are issued for terms 
of up to three years. Under GSM-103, credit guarantees are issued for 
terms of from three to ten years.
    (2) The programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to 
increase or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private 
U.S. financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing 
without CCC's guarantee. The programs are operated in a manner intended 
not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs are targeted 
toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure 
financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial strength so 
that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In 
providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market 
opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term 
market development for U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (3) The credit facility created by these programs is the CCC payment 
guarantee. The payment guarantee is an agreement by CCC to pay the 
exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of 
the exporter's right to proceeds, specified amounts of principal and 
interest due from, but not paid by, the foreign bank issuing an 
irrevocable letter of credit in connection with the export sale to which 
CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, 
rather than governmental, financing and incurs a substantial portion of 
the risk of default by the foreign bank. CCC assumes this risk, in order 
to be able to operate the programs for the purposes specified in Sec. 
1493.2.
    (b) Credit facility mechanism. Typically, in export sales of U.S. 
agricultural commodities, payment by the importer is made under an 
irrevocable letter of credit. For the purpose of the GSM-102 and GSM-103 
programs, CCC will consider applications for payment guarantees only in 
connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the 
payment for the agricultural commodities will be made in one of the two 
following ways:
    (1) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of 
the exporter, specifically stating the deferred payment terms under 
which the foreign bank is obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as 
such payments become due; or
    (2) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of 
the exporter, that is supported by a related obligation specifically 
stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is 
obligated to make payment to the exporter, or the exporter's assignee, 
in U.S. dollars as such payments become due. The exporter may assign the 
right to proceeds under the letter of credit or related obligation to a 
U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the exporter may 
realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred payment date(s) 
as set forth in the irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit or its 
related obligation. The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs are designed to 
protect the exporter or the exporter's assignee against those losses 
specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults, whether for 
commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the foreign bank obligated under 
the letter of credit or related obligation.
    (c) Program administration. The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs will be 
administered pursuant to this part and any Program Announcements and 
Notices to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent 
with, this part. These programs are under the general administrative 
responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS/USDA). The review and payment of claims for loss will be 
administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding 
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, 
and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular USDA or CCC offices, 
will be announced by a public press release (see Sec. 1493.20(c), 
``Contacts P/R'').

[[Page 789]]

    (d) Country allocations and program announcements. From time to 
time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a GSM-102 and/or 
GSM-103 program allocation for a specific country. The Program 
Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific 
allocations for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof. 
Exporters may negotiate export sales to buyers in that country for one 
of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement and seek 
payment guarantee coverage within the dollar amounts of specified 
coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a 
requirement that the exporter's sales contract contain a shipping 
deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for a 
contractual shipping deadline will be stated in the Program 
Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified 
``undesignated'' or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that 
if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country 
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or 
``undesignated'' portion of the total country allocation may then be 
designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include 
an ``allocated'' or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain further 
information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion of the 
country allocation.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.20  Definition of terms.

    Terms set forth in this part, in CCC Program Announcements and 
Notices to Participants, and in any CCC-originated documents pertaining 
to the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs will have the following meanings:
    (a) Assignee. A financial institution in the United States which, 
for adequate consideration given, has obtained the legal rights to

supervision and direction of the Secretary of Agriculture.
    (c) Contacts P/R. A notice issued by FAS/USDA by public press 
release which contains specific names, addresses, and telephone and 
facsimile numbers of contacts within FAS/USDA and CCC for use by persons 
interested in obtaining information concerning the operations of the 
GSM-102 or GSM-103 program. The Contacts P/R also contains details about 
where to submit information required to qualify for program 
participation, to apply for payment guarantees, to request amendments of 
payment guarantees, to submit evidence of export reports, and to give 
notices of default and file claims for loss.
    (d) Date of export. One of the following dates, depending upon the 
method of shipment: the on-board date of an ocean bill of lading or the

qualify will be given an opportunity to provide additional information 
for consideration by CCC.
    (d) Ineligibility for program participation. An applicant may be 
ineligible to participate in the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programs if:
    (1) Such applicant is currently debarred, suspended, or proposed for 
debarment from contracting with or participating in any program 
administered by a U.S. Government agency; or
    (2) Such applicant is controlled or can be controlled, in whole or 
in part, by any individuals or entities currently debarred, suspended or 
proposed for debarment from contracting with or participating in 
programs administered by any U.S. Government agency.

guarantee may be submitted in writing or may be made by telephone, but, 
if made by telephone, it must be confirmed in writing to the office 
specified in the Contacts P/R. An application must identify the name and 
address of the exporter and include the following information:
    (1) Name of the destination country.
    (2) Name and address of the importer.
    (3) Name and address of the intervening purchaser, if any, and a

the price, as agreed between the exporter and the importer. If the 
commodity was sold on the basis of CFR or CIF, the actual (if known at 
the time of application) or estimated value of freight and, in the case 
of sales made on a CIF basis, the actual (if known at the time of 
application) or estimated value of marine and war risk insurance, must 
be specified.
    (10) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any.

for which the exporter is applying for a payment guarantee is also being 
used as the basis for an application for participation in any of the 
following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, Dairy 
Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or 
Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program. The number of the Agreement assigned 
by USDA under one of these programs should be included, as applicable.
    (17) Other information as specified in Notices to Participants, as 
applicable.
    (18) The exporter's statement, ``All Section 1493.50 Certifications 
Are Being Made In This Application'' which, when included in the

in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 1493.50.
    (b) An application for a payment guarantee may be approved as 
submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the exporter, or 
rejected by the GSM. In the event that the application is approved, the 
GSM will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time 
specified in Sec. 1493.60(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit 
sales price of the commodity does not fall

[[Page 794]]

within the prevailing commercial market level ranges, as determined by 
CCC, the application will not be approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.50  Certification requirements for obtaining payment guarantee.

    By providing the statement in Sec. 1493.40(a)(18), the exporter is 
certifying that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section 
have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide 
further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do 
not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application 
for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in Sec. 
1493.40(a)(18), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the 
payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by Sec. 
1493.20(z).
    (b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law;
    (c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable 
oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been 
or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, 
pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of 
any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity 
or product;
    (d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to 
solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement 
or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent 
fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.30 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.30, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications 
with respect to a GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, CCC will have 
the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, 
to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or 
to proceed against the exporter.

[59 FR 52876, Oct. 19, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 24561, May 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.60  Payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's obligation. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC 
agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to 
exceed the guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that 
the foreign bank fails to pay under the foreign bank letter of credit or 
the related obligation. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.
    (b) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to the period beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or on the 
date when interest begins to accrue, whichever is earlier, and will 
continue during the credit term specified in the payment guarantee or 
amendments thereto. However, the payment guarantee becomes effective on 
the date(s) of export(s) of the agricultural commodities or products 
thereof specified in the exporter's application for a payment guarantee.
    (c) Terms of the CCC payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's coverage 
will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the 
time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (d) Final date to export. The final date to export shown on the 
payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the 
contractual deadline for shipping.
    (e) Reserve coverage for loading tolerances. The exporter may apply 
for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee 
fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the 
export sales contract; however, the exporter may

[[Page 795]]

also request that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to 
accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified 
in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee coverage is 
available at the time of application and CCC determines to make such 
reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In the event that the 
exporter ships a quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee 
fee was paid (i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the 
additional coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading 
tolerance, by filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by 
paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the 
payment guarantee is not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days 
after the date of the last export against the sales contract, CCC may 
determine not to reserve the coverage originally set aside for the 
exporter.
    (f) Ineligible exports. Commodities with a date of export prior to 
the date of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written 
application for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after 
the final date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any 
amendments thereof, are ineligible for GSM-102 or GSM-103 guarantee 
coverage, except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best 
interests of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.
    (g) Foreign agricultural component. CCC may approve payment 
guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United 
States agricultural commodities as defined in Sec. 1493.20(z). CCC may 
not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for 
the value of any foreign agricultural component.
    (h) Additional requirements. The payment guarantee may contain such 
additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or 
desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (i) Amendments. A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee 
may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the 
assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the 
amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable 
Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may 
include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and 
an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, 
particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under 
the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. 
(Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be 
submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as 
amendments.)


<R05>
Sec. 1493.70  Guarantee rates and fees.

    (a) Guarantee fee rates. The payment guarantee fee rates will be 
based upon the length of the payment terms provided for in the export 
sale contract, the degree of risk that CCC assumes, as determined by 
CCC, and any other factors which CCC determines appropriate for 
consideration. A current schedule of the guarantee fee rates charged by 
CCC under GSM-102 and GSM-103 will be available upon request from the 
FAS/USDA office specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (b) Calculation of fee. The guarantee fee will be computed by 
multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.
    (c) Payment of fee. The exporter shall remit, with his written 
application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not 
be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The 
exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and 
mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts 
P/R.
    (d) Refunds of fee. Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved 
applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the 
application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be 
made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be 
in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee 
is not approved or is approved

[[Page 796]]

only for a part of the guarantee coverage requested, a full or pro rata 
refund of the fee remittance will be made.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.80  Evidence of export.

    (a) Report of export. The exporter is required to provide CCC an 
evidence of export report for each shipment made under the payment 
guarantee. This report must include the following:
    (1) Payment guarantee number
    (2) Date of export
    (3) Exporter's sale number
    (4) Exported value
    (5) Quantity
    (6) A full description of the commodity exported
    (7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the 
basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price at export 
differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, the exporter is also required to 
submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference.
    (8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any.
    (9) Number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under another program 
if any portion of the export sale was also approved for participation in 
the following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, 
Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or 
Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program.
    (10) The exporter's statement, ``All Sec. 1493.90 Certifications 
Are Being Made In This Evidence Of Export'' which, when included in the 
evidence of export by the exporter, will constitute a certification that 
it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 
1493.90.
    (b) Time limit for submission of evidence of export. The exporter 
must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/
R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 
calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period 
for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of 
the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of 
export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, 
the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the 
extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely 
to result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the 
program;
    (3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or
    (4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for 
submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such 
extension is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.
    (c) Export sales reporting. Exporters may have a mandatory reporting 
responsibility under Section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 
(7 U.S.C. 5712), as amended by Section 1531 of the Food, Agriculture, 
Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 for exports of wheat and wheat 
flour, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, and other agricultural commodities 
and products thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.90  Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

    By providing the statement contained in Sec. 1493.80(a)(10), the 
exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of 
export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements

required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to 
reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or 
violates these certifications with respect to a GSM-102 or GSM-103 
payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other 
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any 
commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The 
exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the 
statement set forth in Sec. 1493.80(a)(10), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment 
guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by Sec. 
1493.20(z).

the foreign bank shown in the payment guarantee to cover the port value 
of the commodity exported;
    (d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.30 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.30 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements.

Sec. 1493.100  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of commodities covered by a GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 payment guarantee to a country other than that shown on the 
payment guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.
    (b) Records of proof of entry. Exporters must obtain and maintain 
records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant 
authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be 
necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programs in the 
country that was the intended country of destination of such 
commodities. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be in English or 
be accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable to CCC. 
Records acceptable to meet this requirement include an original 
certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs or port 
official of the importing country, by the importer, by an agent or 
representative of the vessel or shipline which delivered the 
agricultural commodity to the importing country, or by a private 
surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation deemed 
acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (1) That the agricultural commodity entered the importing country;
    (2) The identification of the export carrier;
    (3) The quantity of the agricultural commodity;
    (4) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the agricultural 
commodity; and
    (5) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the agricultural 
commodity in the importing country. [Records of proof of entry need not 
be submitted with a claim for loss, except as may be provided in Sec. 
1493.110(b)(4)(ii).]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.110  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the foreign bank 
letter of credit or related obligation, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but 
not later than 10 calendar days after the date that payment was due from 
the foreign bank (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted 
in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the 
Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's assignee fails to 
promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with this paragraph, CCC 
may make the payment guarantee null and void with respect to any 
payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit may be extended 
only under extraordinary circumstances and if such extension is 
determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best interests of CCC. 
The notice of default must include:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the country;
    (3) Name of the defaulting bank;
    (4) Due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately 
the amounts for principal and interest;
    (6) Date of foreign bank's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for foreign bank's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due

[[Page 798]]

date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must be submitted in 
writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts 
P/R. The claim for loss must include the following information and 
documents:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the foreign 
bank obligation applicable to the claim;
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i)(A) The foreign bank letter of credit securing the export sale; 
and
    (B) If applicable, the document(s) evidencing the related obligation 
owed by the foreign bank to the assignee financial institution which is 
related to the foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such related obligation must be demonstrated in one of the 
following ways:
    (1) The related obligation, including a specific promise to pay on 
deferred payment terms, may be contained in the letter of credit as a 
special instruction from the issuing bank directly to the U.S. financial 
institution to refinance the amounts paid by the U.S. financial 
institution for obligations financed according to the tenor of the 
letter of credit; or
    (2) The related obligation may be memorialized in a separate 
document(s) specifically identified and referred to in the letter of 
credit as the agreement under which the foreign bank is obliged to repay 
the U.S. financial institution on deferred payment terms; or
    (3) The letter of credit payment obligations may be specifically 
identified in a separate document(s) setting forth the related 
obligation, or in a duly executed amendment thereto, as having been 
financed by the U.S. financial institution pursuant to, and subject to 
repayment in accordance with the terms of, such related obligation; or
    (4) The related obligation may be memorialized in the form of a 
promissory note executed by the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit in favor of the U.S. financial institution submitting the claim;
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the importing country;
    (iii)(A) The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, 
FOB, CFR or CIF values; or
    (B) If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's 
invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's 
invoice to the importer;
    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default 
under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the 
applicable foreign bank letter of credit and the related obligation, if 
applicable; and
    (v) A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the 
exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.80(a).
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. If the initial 
claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee 
need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial 
claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating 
to failure of the foreign bank to make scheduled installments on the 
same export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only 
submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated 
in paragraph (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of 
subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including 
the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.120  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.110, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which

[[Page 799]]

CCC is liable under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and 
any applicable supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to 
Participants. If CCC determines that it is liable to the exporter and/or 
the exporter's assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. CCC's maximum liability for any 
claims for loss submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not 
including any late interest payments due in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus 
eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export, 
plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the day of reciept of a claim found 
by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date 
that payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the 
guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section, and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the 
Department of Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the 
foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed by the foreign 
bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the 
foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the exporter, unless 
it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC by the Controller, 
CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the 
entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default 
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition 
to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a 
payment guarantee, CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take 
any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, 
omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has no 
knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Sec. 1493.80 and Sec. 1493.90, excluding post-export adjustments 
(i.e., corrections to evidence of export reports); and
    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.110.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.130  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights 
under the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer, the foreign bank, or any other source whatsoever, such 
monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies 
are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of 
recovery by the exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery 
to the date of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of 
payment by the exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest 
will be charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment 
guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the 
holder of the

[[Page 800]]

payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided that the 
required information necessary for determining pro rata distribution has 
been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 business days 
from the date of recovery or 15 business days from receiving the 
required information for determining pro rata distribution, whichever is 
later, CCC will pay interest calculated on the latest average investment 
rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by 
the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and such 
interest will accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The 
interest will apply only to the portion of the recovery payable to the 
holder of the payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the 
exporter, the exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will 
be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to 
CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such 
recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on 
a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest 
in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 payment guarantee, CCC prorates any collections it receives and 
shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the 
guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been 
reimbursed in full. Appendix A to Sec. 1493.130--Illustration of Pro 
Rata Allocation of Recoveries--provides an example of the methodology 
used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts 
paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by 
CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in 
material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee 
or for fulfilling obligations under GSM-102 or GSM-103. Further, the 
exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC 
under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the 
exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program 
requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Sec. 1493.50(b) and Sec. 1493.90(d) or the failure of an exporter 
to comply with the provisions of Sec. 1493.100 or Sec. 1493.140(e) 
will not affect the validity of any payment guarantee with respect to an 
assignee which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply 
at the time such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the 
time of assignment of the payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the foreign 
bank and/or the importer.

  Appendix A to Sec. 1493.130--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.130(c), regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for 
claims filed under the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs. A typical case 
might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit 
arrangement with the foreign bank calling for equal annual payments of 
principal and annual payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per 
annum and a penalty interest rate of 12 percent per annum on overdue 
amounts until the overdue amount is paid.
    2. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of 
$100,000 and an interest payment of $10,000, both due on January 31.
    3. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a claim in good order with 
CCC.
    4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
98 percent of the principal amount due ($98,000) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 98 percent of the principal 
($7,840).
    5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    6. The latest bond equivalent rate of the 52-week Treasury bill 
auction average which has been published by the Department of Treasury 
in effect on the date of nonpayment (January 31) is 9 percent. The 
latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury Bill auction average which 
has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect on the date 
of nonpayment by CCC (February 11) is 7 percent.

[[Page 801]]

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the payment 
guarantee would be computed as follows:
    1. CCC's Obligation under the Payment Guarantee:

 
 
 
(a).............................  Principal coverage-- $98,000.00
                                   (98% x $100,000).
(b).............................  Interest coverage--  $7,840.00
                                   (8% x $98,000).
                                                      ------------------
                                                       $105,840.00
(c).............................  Late interest due    $223.28
                                   from CCC (7% per
                                   annum for 11 days
                                   x $105,840).
                                                      ------------------
(d).............................  Amount paid by CCC   $106,063.28
                                   on February 22.
 

    2. Foreign Bank's Obligation under the Letter of Credit or the 
Related Obligation:

 
 
 
(a).............................  Principal due        $100,000.00
                                   January 31.
                                  Interest due         $10,000.00
                                   January 31 (10% x
                                   $100,000).
                                                      ------------------
 
                                  Amount owed by       $110,000.00
                                   foreign bank as of
                                   January 31.
(b).............................  Penalty interest     $795.62
                                   due (12% per annum
                                   for 22 days x
                                   $100,000).
                                                      ------------------
(c).............................  Amount owed by       $110,795.62
                                   foreign bank as of
                                   February 22.
 

    3. Amount of Foreign Bank's Obligation Not Covered by CCC's Payment 
Guarantee: $4,668.55

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the foreign bank obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the foreign bank is 
$110,000, CCC would be entitled to 95.75 percent ($106,063.07 divided by 
$110,765.62) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be entitled 
to 4.21 percent ($4,668.55 divided by $110,795.62) of any recoveries of 
losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this example, the losses 
were recovered after the claim has been paid by CCC, Sec. 1493.130(b) 
would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.140  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to 
such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment 
must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already 
paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless 
approved in advance by CCC, be:
    (i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties or
    (ii) Subject to further assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be 
ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, CCC will provide notice thereof, to the financial 
institution and to the exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of 
an acknowledgment of assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC; or
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial institution:

[[Page 802]]

    (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in 
sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees. CCC may, with 
the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under 
the payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the 
exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for 
the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other 
than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those 
alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in 
rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the 
payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the 
amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment 
guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, must 
maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and 
deliveries of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with a GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, 
including those records generated and maintained by agents, intervening 
purchasers, and related companies involved in special arrangements with 
the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General 
of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be 
given full and complete access to the premises of the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from 
the effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such 
five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the 
exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's or 
related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions 
relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, 
financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, 
processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and 
unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized 
representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside 
the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain 
directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in 
connection with the payment guarantee.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by Sec. 
1493.100(b), and must provide access to such documentation if requested 
by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the 
five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and Notices to 
Participants relating to the GSM-102 or GSM-103 program, as applicable. 
Applicants for payment guarantees under these programs are hereby on 
notice that they will be bound by any terms contained in applicable 
Program Announcements or Notices to Participants issued prior to the 
date of approval of a payment guarantee.
    (g) Submission of documents by principal officers. All required 
submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or 
requests (i.e., requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' 
assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of 
the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In 
cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal or the 
officer, the signature must be accompanied by: wording indicating the 
delegation of authority or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of 
the delegation of authority;

[[Page 803]]

and the name and title of the authorized person or officer. Further, the 
exporter or exporter's assignee must ensure that all information/reports 
required under these regulations are submitted within the required time 
limits. If requested in writing, CCC will acknowledge receipt of a 
submission by the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment 
of receipt is requested, the exporter or exporter's assignee must submit 
an extra copy of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope for 
return by U.S. mail. If courier services are desired for the return 
receipt, the exporter or exporter's assignee must also submit a self-
addressed courier service order which includes the recipient's billing 
code for such service.
    (h) Officials not to benefit. No member of or delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the 
payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this

announcements indicating the availability of facility payment guarantees 
in connection with sales of goods or services to emerging markets. The 
announcements will specify the emerging markets, the maximum amount, in 
U.S. dollars, of guarantee exposure that CCC will undertake, and may 
specify special terms or conditions that will be applicable.
    (b) Sale requirements. CCC will issue facility payment guarantees 
only in connection with projects that CCC determines will benefit 
primarily exports of U.S. agricultural commodities and products, and 
only where there is a firm contract for the sale of goods or services

services between the exporter and the importer shall oblige the importer 
to make an initial payment(s) to the exporter of at least 15 percent of 
the net contract value in Sec. 1493.260(b)(1). Such initial payment(s) 
shall be in U.S. dollars or instruments having a definite value in U.S. 
dollars, and shall be made prior to the export of the goods or services.
    (d) Required method of payment. CCC will issue a facility payment 
guarantee only in connection with a sale in which payment will be made 
under either:
    (1) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit specifically 
stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is 
obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as payments become due; or
    (2) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit supported by a 
related obligation specifically stating the deferred payment terms under 
which the foreign bank is obligated to make payment in U.S. dollars as 
such payments become due.

    (f) Form of related obligation. The related obligation referred to 
in paragraph (d) of this section shall be in one of the following forms:
    (1) A letter of credit including a specific promise to pay on 
deferred payment terms as a special instruction from the issuing bank 
directly to the U.S. financial institution to refinance the amounts paid 
by the U.S. financial institution for obligations financed according to 
the tenor of the letter of credit;

sector ownership of the project;
    (25) The exporter's signature.
    (b) Application fee. The exporter shall pay the application fee 
specified in the program announcement at the time the application is 
submitted. An application will not be considered without payment of the 
specified fee. The application fee is nonrefundable.
    (c) Letter of preliminary commitment. CCC will determine whether, in 
its judgment, the project in connection with which the exporter seeks a 
facility payment guarantee is likely to increase exports of U.S. 
agricultural commodities or products to an emerging market; and whether 
the project is likely to benefit primarily U.S. agricultural commodities 
or products as opposed to commodities or products originating in other 
countries. If necessary, CCC may seek additional information from an 
applicant prior to making its determination. If CCC determines that an 
application meets these standards and appears to represent, in CCC's 
judgment, the best use of available resources, CCC will respond to the 
applicant with a letter of preliminary commitment indicating CCC's 
interest in issuing a facility payment guarantee conditioned on its 
approval of the exporter's final application.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.250  Final application and issuance of a facility payment 
guarantee.

    (a) Final application. An exporter who has received a letter of 
preliminary commitment may, within six months of the date of such 
letter, submit a final application to CCC for a facility payment 
guarantee which shall include the following information:
    (1) A cover sheet with the title: ``Application for a Facility 
Payment Guarantee--Final Commitment.''
    (2) A letterhead statement from the importer's bank or other 
documentation confirming the importer has the financial ability to 
comply with the initial payment requirement in Sec. 1493.230(c);
    (3) Written evidence of a firm sale signed by the exporter and the 
importer, specifying at minimum, the following information: Goods or 
services to be exported, quantities of such items, delivery terms (e.g., 
FOB, CFR, CIF), delivery period(s), contract value, payment terms, and 
date of sale. A sales contract may be contingent upon obtaining a 
facility payment guarantee;
    (4) A description of any changes in the information submitted in the 
preliminary application; and
    (5) The exporter's signature;
    (b) Additional information. CCC shall have the right to request the 
exporter to furnish any other information and documentation it deems 
pertinent to the evaluation of the exporter's final application for a 
final commitment. CCC may request from the exporter an independent 
engineering study or economic feasibility study relating to the project.
    (c) Final commitment letter. After making a favorable determination 
on the exporter's submissions, CCC will issue a final commitment letter 
indicating the applicable exposure fee rate and stating that CCC is 
prepared to issue a facility payment guarantee upon receiving full 
payment of the exposure fee within an allotted time. The letter will 
also indicate the key terms and coverage of the guarantee to be issued. 
CCC will also inform exporters in writing when it denies their request 
for a facility payment guarantee.
    (d) Exposure fee. The exposure fee is calculated by multiplying the 
requested guaranteed value (up to the maximum established by CCC's final 
commitment letter) by the exposure fee rate. Once the facility payment 
guarantee is issued to the exporter, CCC will ordinarily not refund the 
exposure fee. If CCC does not issue a facility payment guarantee, or 
issues a guarantee for only part of the coverage requested, CCC will 
make a full or pro rata refund of the exposure fee, as appropriate.
    (e) Issuance of the facility payment guarantee. Upon receipt of the 
exposure

[[Page 808]]

fee, CCC will issue a facility payment guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.260  Facility payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's maximum obligation. CCC will agree to pay the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee an amount not to exceed the guaranteed value 
stipulated on the face of the facility payment guarantee, plus eligible 
interest, in the event that the foreign bank fails to pay under the 
foreign bank letter of credit or related obligation. The exact amount of 
CCC's liability in the event of default will be determined in accordance 
with Sec. 1493.310(b).
    (b) Calculation of maximum guarantee coverage. CCC will determine 
the maximum amount of its obligation under a facility payment guarantee 
by calculating a:
    (1) Net contract value equal to the contract value minus:
    (i) The value of goods that are not U.S. goods; and
    (ii) The cost of services that are not U.S. services (except those 
services the exporter requests CCC to determine are vital to the success 
of the project and approved to be included in the net contract value);
    (2) Facility base value equal to net contract value minus:
    (i) The amount to be paid in accordance with the initial payment 
requirement in Sec. 1493.230(c); and
    (ii) The amount of discounts and allowances; and
    (3) Maximum guaranteed value equal to:
    (i) A principal amount determined by multiplying the facility base 
value (as determined in Sec. 1493.260(b)(2)) by the guaranteed 
percentage specified in the program announcement; and
    (ii) Interest on such principal amount at the rate specified in the 
applicable program announcement, not to exceed the investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 52-week bill auction in effect at that time.
    (c) Value and cost. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Value means declared customs value of the goods; or, in the 
absence of specific information regarding declared customs value, the 
fair market wholesale value of the imported goods in the United States 
at the time they were acquired by the participant; and
    (2) Cost means actual amount paid by the exporter for the services 
in an arms-length transaction; or in the absence of an arms-length 
transaction, the fair market value of the services at the time the 
services were provided.
    (d) U.S. content test. (1) CCC will issue a guarantee only if the 
following items collectively represent less than 50 percent of the net 
contract value in Sec. 1493.260(b)(1):
    (i) The value of imported components (except for raw materials) that 
are assembled, processed, or manufactured into U.S. goods included in 
the net contract value;
    (ii) The cost of services that are not U.S. services (including 
freight on foreign flag carriers and transportation insurance registered 
with foreign agents) that, at the request of the exporter, CCC 
determines are vital to the success of the project and approves their 
inclusion in the net contract value;
    (2) For purpose of this subsection, minor or cosmetic procedures 
(e.g., affixing labels, cleaning, painting, polishing) do not qualify as 
assembling, processing or manufacturing;
    (3) For purpose of this subsection, local services which involve 
costs for hotels, meals, transportation, and other similar services 
incurred in the emerging market are not U.S. services.
    (e) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to the period beginning on the date(s) of export(s) and will continue 
during the credit term specified in the facility payment guarantee. For 
goods, the period of coverage will also apply from the date on which 
interest begins to accrue, if earlier than the date of export. The final 
payments of principal and interest by the foreign bank must come due 
within the period of guarantee coverage.
    (f) Terms of the CCC facility payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's 
coverage will be set forth in the facility payment guarantee and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
program announcement(s) or notice(s) to participants in effect at the 
time the facility

[[Page 809]]

payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (g) Final date to export. The final date to export will be stated in 
the facility payment guarantee.
    (h) Ineligible exports. Goods or services with a date of export 
prior to the date CCC issues the facility payment guarantee are 
ineligible for coverage unless approved by the GSM.
    (i) Additional requirements. The facility payment guarantee may 
contain such additional terms, conditions, and limitations as are deemed 
necessary or desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the facility payment guarantee, are binding 
on the exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (j) Amendments. Exporters must notify CCC of any amendments 
concerning contracts covered by a facility payment guarantee. CCC will 
determine if the contract amendments will require amendments to the 
facility payment guarantee. Amending the facility payment guarantee may 
result in an increase to the exposure fee. Requests made by the exporter 
to amend the facility payment guarantee so as to change the guaranteed 
value must have the concurrence of the assignee when an assignment has 
been made.
    (k) Effective date. The facility payment guarantee shall become 
effective on the date of export of the goods or services.

Appendix to Sec. 1493.260--Illustration of FGP Coverage of Imported Raw 
     Materials, Components, and Services That Are Not U.S. Services

    The following example illustrates CCC's regulations and policy 
options with regard to issuing a payment guarantee for a project which 
includes imported raw materials, imported components, and services that 
are not U.S. services:
    1. Ten grain trucks and one truck scale are to be exported from the 
U.S. to an emerging market. The trucks will provide the ability to 
purchase larger quantities of grain from the U.S. The contract value 
totals $2,025,000, cost, insurance and freight (CIF) basis.
    2. The fenders, hoods and doors of the trucks have been manufactured 
and assembled in the U.S. and contain some imported raw materials (sheet 
metal).
    3. Imported components consist of starters and alternators, with a 
U.S. customs valuation of $149,000. These items are installed into the 
trucks in the U.S.
    4. The truck scale was imported from Canada into the U.S. with a 
U.S. customs valuation of $20,000.
    5. A U.S. citizen, will travel on a foreign airline carrier to the 
emerging market (airfare is $1,000) to instruct mechanics in repair and 
maintenance of the trucks. He will be paid a salary for this service 
and, in addition, will be reimbursed separately for local costs in the 
emerging market (e.g., hotel, meals, transportation) which are estimated 
to be $5,000.
    6. The trucks are to be shipped on foreign flag vessels, and the 
marine insurance is to be placed with a foreign agent. The combined cost 
of these services that are not U.S. services for which the exporter 
seeks coverage is estimated to be $500,000.

          CCC's Approval of Services That Are Not U.S. Services

    CCC agrees to include in the net contract value the foreign flag 
freight and marine insurance ($500,000) and the airfare ($1,000) of the 
U.S. instructor (Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)).

                    Calculation of Net Contract Value

    CCC will calculate the net contract value by subtracting from the 
contract value ($2,025,000) the U.S. customs value of the truck scale 
($20,000) in accordance with Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)(I) and the local costs 
to be incurred by the U.S. instructor ($5,000) in accordance with Sec. 
1493.260(b)(1)(ii) to equal $2,000,000.

             CCC's Determination of U.S. Content Eligibility

    The imported components and services that are not U.S. services 
approved for coverage total $650,000 (i.e., $149,000 for starters and 
alternators, $1,000 for airfare, $500,000 for freight and insurance; or 
32.5 percent of the net contract value of $2,000,000 (Sec. 
1493.260(b)(1)). Since this is less than 50 percent of the net contract 
value the transaction meets the U.S. content test (Sec. 1493.260(d)).

payment schedule is unknown, the exporter must indicate in writing that: 
``The payment schedule will be provided in an amendment to the evidence 
of export report when the payment schedule has been determined;''
    (10) Written statements that:
    (i) The goods exported or services provided were included in the 
final application for a final commitment as approved by CCC for coverage 
under the facility payment guarantee and this subpart;
    (ii) The specifications and quantity of goods or services exported 
conform to the information contained in the exporter's application 
documents for a facility payment guarantee, or if different, that CCC 
has approved of such changes;
    (iii) A letter of credit has been opened in favor of the exporter by 
the foreign bank shown on the facility payment guarantee to cover the 
dollar amount of the sale of goods or services exported less the amount 
paid in accordance with the initial payment requirement and less 
discounts and allowances; and
    (11) The exporter's signature.
    (b) Final report of export. The final evidence of export report 
submitted under a facility payment guarantee must contain:
    (1) A written statement that exports under the facility payment 
guarantee have been completed;
    (2) The information requested in Sec. 1493.280(a) for the 
shipment(s) included in the final report; and
    (3) The combined total of all dollar amounts reported under Sec. 
1493.280 (a) and (b) for all reports.
    (c) Time limit for submission of evidence of export report. Unless 
extended by CCC for good cause, the exporter must submit to CCC an 
evidence of export report:
    (1) Within 60 days of the date goods are exported by rail or truck;
    (2) Within 30 days of the date goods are exported by any other 
carrier; or
    (3) Within 30 days of the date of export of services.
    (d) Late reports. If the evidence of export report is not received 
by CCC within the time period for filing, the facility payment guarantee 
will become null and void only if and only to the extent that failure to 
make timely filing resulted, or would likely result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the FGP;
    (3) The obstruction of the fair administration of the FGP; or

[[Page 811]]

    (4) A threat to the integrity of the FGP.

Sec. 1493.290  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of goods covered by a facility payment 
guarantee to a country other than that shown on the facility payment 
guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.
    (b) Records of proof of entry. Exporters must obtain and maintain 
records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant 
authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be 
necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the goods authorized by the 
facility payment guarantee. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be

<R05>
Sec. 1493.300  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the foreign bank 
letter of credit or related obligation, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but 
not later than ten days after the date that payment was due from the 
foreign bank (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in 
writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts 
P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's assignee fails to promptly notify 
CCC of defaults in accordance with this paragraph, CCC may make the 
facility payment guarantee null and void with respect to any payment(s) 
applicable to such default. This time limit may be extended only under 
extraordinary circumstances and if approved by the Controller, CCC. The 
notice of default must include:
    (1) Facility payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the emerging market;
    (3) Name of the defaulting bank;
    (4) Payment due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately 
the amounts for principal and interest;
    (6) Date of foreign bank's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for the foreign bank's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must 
be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified 
in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following 
information and documents:
    (1) Facility payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue and the interest rate on the foreign 
bank obligation applicable to the claim; and
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i)(A) The foreign bank's letter of credit securing the export sale, 
and;
    (B) If applicable, the document(s) evidencing the related obligation 
owed by the foreign bank to the assignee financial institution which is 
related to the foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the 
exporter.
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed

[[Page 812]]

by the shipping company with the onboard ocean carrier date for each 
shipment, the airway bill; or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry 
certificate or similar document signed by an official of the emerging 
market;
    (iii) The exporter's sales invoice(s) showing the value and basis of 
sale (e.g., FOB, CFR, or CIF) or, if services are billed separately, 
documents that the exporter or its assignee relied upon in extending the 
credit to the issuing foreign bank;
    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default. 
The instrument must reference the applicable foreign bank letter of 
credit and the related obligation, if applicable; and
    (v) A copy of the evidence of export report(s) previously submitted 
by the exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.280.
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. The exporter or 
an exporter's assignee need only provide one claim which meets full 
documentation requirements relating to a covered transaction. For 
subsequent claims relating to such failures of the foreign bank to make 
scheduled installments on the same export, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure 
containing the information stated in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (3) of 
this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) 
of this section, and the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.310  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.300, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the facility payment guarantee, this subpart, program 
announcement(s) and notice(s) to participants. If CCC determines that it 
is liable to the exporter or the exporter's assignee, CCC will pay the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee in accordance with paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. CCC's maximum liability for any 
claims for loss submitted with respect to any facility payment 
guarantee, not including any late interest payments due in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the facility payment 
guarantee, plus eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the facility payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export 
report (Sec. 1493.280(a)(7)), plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the claim was found by CCC to be in 
good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is 
made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as 
determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will be 
calculated based on the latest average investment rate of the most 
recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department of 
Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the 
foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed by the foreign 
bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the 
foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the exporter, unless 
it is determined to be in the best interest of CCC by the Controller, 
CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the 
entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default 
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition 
to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to the value of goods or 
services covered by a facility payment guarantee, CCC will not hold the 
assignee

[[Page 813]]

responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the assignee 
for any action, omission or statement by the exporter of which the 
assignee has no knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Sec. 1493.270 and Sec. 1493.280 excluding post-export adjustments 
(i.e., corrections of evidence of export reports); and
    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.300.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.320  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights 
under the subrogation agreement to recover all monies in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer, the foreign bank or any other source whatsoever, such 
monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies 
are not received by CCC within 15 days from the date of recovery by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date 
of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest 
average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day auction, as 
announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of 
recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be 
charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a facility 
payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay 
the holder of the facility payment guarantee its pro rata share 
immediately, provided that the required information necessary for 
determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not 
made by CCC within 15 days from the date of recovery or 15 days from 
receiving the required information for determining pro rata 
distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of 
payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the 
recovery payable to the holder of the facility payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the 
exporter, the exporter's assignee or any other source whatsoever, will 
be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to 
CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such 
recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on 
a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest 
in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a facility 
payment guarantee, CCC prorates any collections it receives and shares 
these collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until 
both CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. 
Appendix to Sec. 1493.320 provides an example of the methodology used 
by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
facility payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any 
amounts paid by CCC under the facility payment guarantee when and if it 
is determined by CCC that the exporter engaged in fraud, or has been or 
is in breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the facility payment 
guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under the FGP. Further, the 
exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC 
under the facility payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC 
that the exporter's assignee engaged in fraud or otherwise violated 
program requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Sec. 1493.270 or the failure of an exporter to comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 1493.290 or Sec. 1493.330(e) will not affect the 
validity

[[Page 814]]

of any facility payment guarantee with respect to an assignee which had 
no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the time such 
exporter applied for the facility payment guarantee or at the time of 
assignment of the facility payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the foreign 
bank or the importer.

   Appendix to Sec. 1493.320--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.320, regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for claims 
filed under the FGP. For the purpose of this example only, even though 
CCC interest coverage is on a floating rate basis, a constant rate of 
interest is assumed. A typical case might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit 
arrangement for the export sale of goods and services with the foreign 
bank calling for equal semi-annual payments of principal and semi-annual 
payment of interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum and a penalty 
interest rate of 12 percent per annum on overdue amounts until the 
overdue amount is paid.
    2. Exported value reported to CCC equals $300,000.
    3. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of 
$50,000 and an interest payment of $2,493.15, both due on January 31.
    4. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a notice of default and claim 
in good order with CCC.
    5. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
95 percent of the principal amount due ($47,500) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 95 percent of the principal 
($1,894.80).
    6. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    7. The latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury Bill auction 
average which has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect 
on the date of nonpayment by CCC (February 11) is 7 percent.

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the facility 
payment guarantee would be computed as follows:

1. CCC's Obligation under the Facility Payment Guarantee:
    (a) Principal coverage--(95% x $50,000)................   $47,500.00
    (b) Interest coverage--(8% x $47,500 x 182/365)........     1,894.80
                                                            ------------
        Total..............................................    49,394.80
    (c) Late interest due from CCC (7% per annum for 11           104.20
     days x $49,394.80)....................................
                                                            ------------
    (d) Amount paid by CCC on February 22..................    49,499.00
                                                            ============
2. Foreign Bank's Obligation under the Letter of Credit or
 the Related Obligation:
    (a) Principal due January 31...........................    50,000.00
        Interest due January 31 (10% x $ 50,000 x 182/365).     2,493.15
                                                            ------------
        Amount owed by foreign bank as of January 31.......    52,493.15
    (b) Penalty interest due (12% per annum for 22 days x $       361.64
     50,000)...............................................
                                                            ------------
    (c) Amount owed by foreign bank as of February 22......    52,854.79
3. Amount of Foreign Bank's Obligation Not Covered by CCC's     3,355.79
 Payment Guarantee:........................................
 

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the foreign bank obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the foreign bank is 
$52,854.79, CCC would be entitled to 93.65 percent ($49,499.00 divided 
by $52,854.79) and the holder of the facility payment guarantee would be 
entitled to 6.35 percent ($3,355.79 divided by $52,854.79) of any 
recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this 
example, the losses were recovered after the claim had been paid by CCC, 
Sec. 1493.320(b) would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.330  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a facility payment guarantee or the 
right to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The 
assignment must cover all amounts payable under the facility payment 
guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and 
may not, unless approved in advance by CCC, be subject to further 
assignment. Any assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee 
for two or more parties participating in the assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the

[[Page 815]]

assignee with the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the 
Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be 
ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, CCC will provide notice thereof to such financial 
institution and to the exporter issued the facility payment guarantee in 
lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a facility payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC; or
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a facility payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial 
institution:
    (1) At the time of assignment of a facility payment guarantee, is 
not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of facility payment guarantees. CCC 
may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds 
payable under the facility payment guarantee has been assigned, with the 
agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms or 
conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a facility 
payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC 
determines that those alternative procedures, terms or conditions are 
appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction 
covered by the facility payment guarantee and would not result in CCC 
paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a facility 
payment guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as 
applicable, must maintain and make available all records pertaining to 
sales and deliveries of and extension of credit for goods or services 
exported in connection with a facility payment guarantee, including 
those records generated and maintained by agents, and related companies 
involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through 
their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access 
to the premises of the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as 
applicable, during regular business hours from the effective date of the 
facility payment guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period 
to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the exporter's, 
exporter's assignee's, or a related company's books, records, and 
accounts concerning transactions relating to the facility payment 
guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts 
pertaining to sales, inventory, manufacturing, processing, and 
administrative and incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by Sec. 
1493.290(b), and must provide access to such document if requested by 
the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the 
five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

[[Page 816]]

    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, this subpart, program announcement(s), and notice(s) to 
participants relating to the FGP, as applicable. Applicants for facility 
payment guarantees under this program are hereby on notice that they 
will be bound by any terms contained in applicable program 
announcement(s) or notice(s) to participants issued prior to the date of 
approval of a facility payment guarantee.
    (g) Submission of documents by principal officers. All required 
submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or 
requests (i.e., requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' 
assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of 
the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In 
cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal or the 
officer, the signature must be accompanied by:
    (1) Wording indicating the delegation of authority or, in the 
alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority; and
    (2) The name and title of the authorized person or officer. Further, 
the exporter or exporter's assignee must ensure that all information/
reports required under this subpart are submitted within the required 
time limits. If requested in writing, CCC will acknowledge receipt of a 
submission by the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment 
of receipt is requested, the exporter or exporter's assignee must submit 
an extra copy of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope for 
return by U.S. mail. If courier services are desired for the return 
receipt, the exporter or exporter's assignee must also submit a self-
addressed courier service order which includes the recipient's billing 
code for such service.
    (h) Officials not to benefit. No member of or delegate to Congress, 
or resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the 
facility payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, 
but this provision shall not be construed to extend to the facility 
payment guarantee if made with a corporation for its general benefit.
    (i) Deadlines. (1) Where a deadline is fixed in terms of days, it 
means business days and excludes Saturdays, Sundays and federal 
holidays.
    (2) Where a deadline is fixed in terms of months, the deadline falls 
on the same day of the month as the day triggering the deadline period, 
or if there is no same day, the last day of the month; and
    (3) Where a deadline would otherwise fall on a Saturday, Sunday or 
federal holiday, the deadline shall be the next business day.

       Subpart D_CCC Supplier Credit Guarantee Program Operations

    Source: 61 FR 33831, July 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.400  General statement.

    (a) Overview. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing 
the operations of the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP). The 
restrictions and criteria set forth at subpart A for the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and 
the Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) will apply to this 
subpart. The SCGP was developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by 
making available payment guarantees to encourage U.S. exporters to 
extend financing on credit terms of not more than 180 days to importers 
of U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (2) The SCGP operates in cases where credit is necessary to increase 
or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private U.S. 
exporters would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's 
guarantee. The program is operated in a manner intended not to interfere 
with markets for cash sales. The program is targeted toward those 
countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the 
exports but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign 
exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this 
credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for 
U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term

[[Page 817]]

market development for U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (3) The credit facility created by this program is the SCGP payment 
guarantee (payment guarantee). The payment guarantee is an agreement by 
CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take 
assignment of the exporter's right to proceeds, specified amounts of 
principal and, where applicable, interest due from, but not paid by, the 
importer incurring the obligation in connection with the export sale to 
which CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, 
rather than government, financing and incurs a substantial portion of 
the risk of default by the importer. CCC assumes this risk, in order to 
be able to operate the program for the purposes specified in Sec. 
1493.2.
    (b) Credit facility mechanism. (1) For the purpose of the SCGP, CCC 
will consider applications for payment guarantees only in connection 
with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for 
the agricultural commodities will be made under an unconditional and 
irrevocable importer obligation to a U.S. exporter payable in U.S. 
dollars, as defined in Sec. 1493.410(n).
    (2) The exporter may assign the right to proceeds under the importer 
obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the 
exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred 
payment date(s) as set forth in the importer obligation.
    (3) The SCGP payment guarantee is designed to protect the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment 
guarantee resulting from defaults, whether for commercial or 
noncommercial reasons, by the importer under the importer's obligation.
    (c) Program administration. The SCGP will be administered pursuant 
to subpart A and this subpart and any Program Announcements and Notices 
to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent with, 
this subpart. This program is under the general administrative 
responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS/USDA). The review and payment of claims for loss will be 
administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding 
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, 
and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular USDA or CCC offices, 
will be announced by a public press release (see Sec. 1493.410(c), 
``Contacts P/R'').
    (d) Country allocations and program announcements. From time to 
time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a SCGP 
allocation for a specific country. The Program Announcement for a 
country allocation will designate specific allocations for U.S. 
agricultural commodities or products thereof, will indicate the form of 
promissory note required by CCC, and will provide other pertinent 
information. Exporters may negotiate export sales to importers in that 
country for one of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement 
and seek payment guarantee coverage within the dollar amounts of 
specified coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will 
contain a requirement that the exporter's sales contract contain a 
shipping deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for 
a contractual shipping deadline will be stated in the Program 
Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified 
``undesignated'' or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that 
if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country 
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or 
``undesignated'' portion of the total country allocation may then be 
designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include 
an ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain 
further information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion 
of the country allocation.

if made by telephone, it must be confirmed in writing to the office 
specified in the Contacts P/R. An application must identify the name and 
address of the exporter and include the following information:
    (1) Name of the destination country;

chooses, a request for CCC to reserve coverage up to the maximum 
quantity permitted by the contract loading tolerance;
    (9) Unit sales price of the commodity, or a mechanism to establish 
the price, as agreed between the exporter and the importer. If the 
commodity was sold on the basis of CFR or CIF, the actual (if known at 
the time of application) or estimated value of freight and, in the case 
of sales made on a CIF basis, the actual (if known at the time of 
application) or estimated value of marine and war risk insurance, must 
be specified;

    (11) Port value (includes upward loading tolerance, if any);
    (12) Guaranteed value;
    (13) Guarantee fee;
    (14) The term length for the credit being extended and the intervals 
between principal payments for each shipment to be made under the export 
sale;
    (15) A statement indicating whether any portion of the export sale 
for which the exporter is applying for a payment guarantee is also being 
used

[[Page 822]]

as the basis for an application for participation in any of the 
following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, Dairy 
Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or 
Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program. The number of the Agreement assigned 
by USDA under one of these programs should be included, as applicable;
    (16) Other information as requested by CCC or specified in Program 
Announcements and Notices to Participants, as applicable; and
    (17) The exporter's statement, ``ALL SECTION 1493.440 CERTIFICATIONS 
ARE BEING MADE IN THIS APPLICATION'' which, when included in the 
application by the exporter, will constitute a certification that it is 
in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 1493.440.
    (b) An application for a payment guarantee may be approved as 
submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the exporter, or 
rejected by the GSM. In the event that the application is approved, the 
GSM will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time 
specified in Sec. 1493.450(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit 
sales price of the commodity does not fall within the prevailing 
commercial market level ranges, as determined by CCC, the application 
will not be approved.
    (c) Ineligible exporter. An exporter will be ineligible to obtain a 
payment guarantee if such exporter:
    (1) Directly or indirectly owns or controls the importer;
    (2) Is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the importer; 
or
    (3) Is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a person(s) or

<R05>
Sec. 1493.440  Certification requirements for payment guarantee.

further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do 
not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application 
for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in Sec. 
1493.430(a)(17), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the 
payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by Sec. 
1493.410(x).
    (b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law;
    (c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable 
oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been 
or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, 
pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of 
any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity 
or product;
    (d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to 
solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement 
or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent 
fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.420, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications 
with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, 
notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul 
guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to 
proceed against the exporter.

[61 FR 33831, July 1, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 24561, May 6, 1997]

[[Page 823]]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.450  Payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's obligation. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC 
agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to 
exceed the guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that 
the importer fails to pay under the importer obligation. unless CCC 
determines with respect to the particular transaction and claim that the 
guaranteed portion of the port value exceeded the prevailing U.S. market 
value for the same, or same type of agricultural commodity or product. 
In making this determination, CCC will adjust the prevailing U.S. market 
value for estimated freight and/or insurance costs if the export sale 
was made on a CFR or CIF basis. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.
    (b) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to a credit period not exceeding 180 days beginning either on the 
date(s) of export(s) or from the date when interest begins to accrue 
whichever is earlier, and will continue during the credit term specified 
in the payment guarantee or amendments thereto. However, the payment 
guarantee becomes effective on the date(s) of export(s) of the 
agricultural commodities or products thereof specified in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee.
    (c) Terms of the CCC payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's coverage 
will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the 
time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (d) Final date to export. The final date to export shown on the 
payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the 
contractual deadline for shipping.
    (e) Reserve coverage for loading tolerances. The exporter may apply 
for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee 
fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the 
export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC 
reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of 
the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If 
such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of 
application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so 
indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a 
quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid 
(i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage 
from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing 
for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional 
amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is 
not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the 
last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve 
the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.
    (f) Ineligible exports. Commodities with a date of export prior to 
the date of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written 
application for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after 
the final date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any 
amendments thereof, are ineligible for guarantee coverage under this 
subpart, except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best 
interests of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.
    (g) Foreign agricultural component. CCC may approve payment 
guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United 
States agricultural commodities as defined in Sec. 1493.410(x). CCC may 
not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for 
the value of any foreign agricultural component.
    (h) Additional requirements. The payment guarantee may contain such 
additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or 
desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (i) Amendments. A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee 
may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the 
assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the 
amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any

[[Page 824]]

applicable Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments 
may include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period 
and an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment 
guarantee, particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's 
liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the 
guarantee fee. (Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error 
which may be submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are 
not viewed as amendments.)


<R05>
Sec. 1493.460  Guarantee rates and fees.

    (a) Guarantee fee rates. The current payment guarantee fee rate(s) 
will be available by Program Announcement.
    (b) Calculation of fee. The guarantee fee will be computed by 
multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.
    (c) Payment of fee. The exporter shall remit, with his written 
application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not 
be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The 
exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and 
mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts 
P/R.
    (d) Refunds of fee. Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved 
applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the 
application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be 
made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be 
in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee 
is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage 
requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.470  Evidence of export.

    (a) Report of export. The exporter is required to provide CCC an 
evidence of export report for each shipment made under the payment 
guarantee. This report must include the following:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Date of export;
    (3) Exporter's sale number;
    (4) Exported value;
    (5) Quantity;
    (6) A full description of the commodity exported;
    (7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the 
basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price at export 
differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, the exporter is also required to 
submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference;
    (8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any;
    (9) Number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under any other program 
if any portion of the export sale was also approved for participation in 
any of the following CCC or USDA export program: Export Enhancement 
Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance 
Program, or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program; and
    (10) The exporter's statement, ``ALL SECTION 1493.480 CERTIFICATIONS 
ARE BEING MADE IN THIS EVIDENCE OF EXPORT'' which, when included in the 
evidence of export by the exporter, will constitute a certification that 
it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 
1493.480.
    (b) Time limit for submission of evidence of export. The exporter 
must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/
R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 
calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period 
for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of 
the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of 
export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, 
the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the 
extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely 
to result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the 
program;
    (3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or
    (4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for 
submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such 
extension is

[[Page 825]]

determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.
    (c) Export sales reporting. Exporters may have a mandatory reporting 
responsibility under section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, 
as amended (7 U.S.C. 5712) for exports of wheat and wheat flour, feed 
grains, oilseeds, cotton, and other agricultural commodities and 
products thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.480  Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

    By providing the statement contained in Sec. 1493.470(a)(10), the 
exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of 
export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements 
set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be 
required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to 
reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or 
violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, 
CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under 
this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet 
exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The exporter, in 
submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth 
in Sec. 1493.470(a)(10), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment 
guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by Sec. 
1493.410(x).
    (b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity 
called for in the exporter's sales contract with the importer have been 
exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee;
    (c) There is an importer obligation as defined in Sec. 1493.410(n) 
to cover the exported value of the commodity exported;
    (d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.420 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 1493.490  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of commodities covered by a SCGP 
payment guarantee to a country other than that shown on the payment 
guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.
    (b) Records of proof of entry. Exporters must obtain and maintain 
records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant 
authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be 
necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with the SCGP in the country that was the 
intended country of destination of such commodities. Records 
demonstrating proof of entry must be in English or be accompanied by a 
certified or other translation acceptable to CCC. Records acceptable to 
meet this requirement include an original certification of entry signed 
by a duly authorized customs or port official of the importing country, 
by the importer, by an agent or representative of the vessel or shipline 
which delivered the agricultural commodity to the importing country, or 
by a private surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation 
deemed acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (1) That the agricultural commodity entered the importing country;
    (2) The identification of the export carrier;
    (3) The quantity of the agricultural commodity;
    (4) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the agricultural 
commodity; and
    (5) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the agricultural 
commodity in the importing country. (Records of proof of entry need not 
be submitted with a claim for loss, except as may be provided in Sec. 
1493.500(b)(4)(ii).)

[[Page 826]]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.500  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the importer fails to make payment 
pursuant to the terms of the importer obligation, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as 
possible, but not later than 10 calendar days after the date that 
payment was due from the importer (the due date). A notice of default 
must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address 
specified in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with 
this paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with 
respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit 
may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if such 
extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best 
interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the country;
    (3) Name of the defaulting importer;
    (4) Due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately 
the amounts for principal and interest;
    (6) Date of importer's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for importer's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must 
be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified 
in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following 
information and documents:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the importer 
obligation applicable to the claim;
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i) The importer obligation;
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the importing country;
    (iii)(A) The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, 
FOB, CFR or CIF values; or
    (B) If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's 
invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's 
invoice to the importer;
    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default 
under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the 
applicable importer obligation; and
    (v) A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the 
exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.470(a).
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. If the initial 
claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee 
need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial 
claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating 
to failure of the importer to make scheduled installments on the same 
export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only 
submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated 
in paragraph (b) (1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of 
subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including 
the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.510  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.500, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any

[[Page 827]]

applicable supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to 
Participants. If CCC determines that it is liable to the exporter and/or 
the exporter's assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. Subject to a determination by CCC 
with respect to prevailing U.S. market value pursuant to Sec. 
1493.450(a) of this part, CCC's maximum liability for any claims for 
loss submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not including any 
late interest payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus 
eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export, 
plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the day of receipt of a claim found 
by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date 
that payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the 
guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section, and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the 
Department of Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract or the 
importer obligation unless it is determined to be in the best interests 
of CCC by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its 
option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued 
interest, in default and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from 
CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a 
payment guarantee, CCC will not, except pursuant to a determination 
under Sec. 1493.450(a) of this part, hold the assignee responsible or 
take any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any 
action, omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has 
no knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Sec. Sec. 1493.470 and 1493.480, excluding post-export adjustments 
(i.e., corrections to evidence of export reports); and
    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.500.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.520  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the importer of CCC's rights under 
the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer or any other source whatsoever, such monies shall be 
immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies are not received 
by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will 
owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt by 
CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest average 
investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as 
announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of 
recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be 
charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment 
guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the 
holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share

[[Page 828]]

immediately, provided that the required information necessary for 
determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not 
made by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery or 15 
business days from receiving the required information for determining 
pro rata distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest 
calculated on the latest average investment rate of the most recent 
Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of 
Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and such interest will 
accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will 
apply only to the portion of the recovery payable to the holder of the 
payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the 
exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated 
by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to CCC on a pro 
rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. 
The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata 
basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in 
default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment 
guarantee, CCC pro rates any collections it receives and shares these 
collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both 
CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. 
Appendix A to Sec. 1493.520--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
Recoveries--provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in 
applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts 
paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by 
CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in 
material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee 
or for fulfilling obligations under SCGP. Further, the exporter's 
assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the 
payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the 
exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program 
requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Sec. Sec. 1493.440(b) and 1493.480(d) or the failure of an exporter 
to comply with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1493.490 or 1493.530(e) will 
not affect the validity of any payment guarantee with respect to an 
assignee which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply 
at the time such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the 
time of assignment of the payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the importer.

  Appendix A to Sec. 1493.520--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.520(c), regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for 
claims filed under the SCGP. A typical case might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. exporter enters into a $200,000, 180 day credit 
arrangement with the importer calling for two equal payments of 
principal and two equal payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per 
annum and a penalty interest rate of 12 percent per annum (basis 360 
days) on overdue amounts until the overdue amount is paid. (Basis for 
interest calculation may be 360 or 365 days.)
    2. The importer fails to make the final principal payment of 
$100,000 and an interest payment of $2,500.00 (10% per annum for 90 days 
on $100,000), both due on January 31.
    3. On February 10, the U.S. exporter files a claim in good order 
with CCC.
    4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
60 percent of the principal amount due ($60,000) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 60 percent of the principal 
outstanding ($1,183.56) (8% per annum for 90 days on $60,000). (CCC's 
basis for interest calculation is 365 days.)
    5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    6. The average investment rate of the most recent 91-day Treasury 
Bill auction average which has been published by the Department of 
Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment by CCC (January 31) is 7 
percent. (CCC's late interest rate.)

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the payment 
guarantee would be computed as follows:

[[Page 829]]



1. CCC's Obligation under the Payment Guarantee:
    (a) Principal coverage--(60% $100,000)...........         $60,000.00
    (b) Interest coverage--(8% per annum for 90 days            1,183.56
     on $60,000, basis 365 days).....................
                                                      ------------------
                                                              $61,183.56
    (c) Late interest due from CCC (7% per annum for              129.07
     11 days on $61,183.56, basis 365 days)..........
                                                      ------------------
    (d) Amount paid by CCC on February 22............         $61,312.63
                                                      ==================
2. Importer's obligation under the importer
 obligation:
    (a) Principal due January 31.....................        $100,000.00
        Interest due January 31 (10% per annum for 90           2,500.00
         days on $100,000, basis 360 days)...........
                                                      ------------------
        Amount owed by importer as of January 31.....        $102,500.00
    (b) Penalty interest due (12% per annum for 22                751.67
     days on $102,500.00, basis 360 days)............
                                                      ------------------
    (c) Amount owed by importer as of February 22....        $103,251.67
3. Amount of importer's obligation not covered by
 CCC's payment guarantee: $41,939.04 ($103,251.67-
 $61,312.63).........................................
 

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the importer obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the importer is 
$103,251.67, CCC would be entitled to 59.38 percent ($61,312.63 divided 
by $103,251.67) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be 
entitled to 40.62 percent ($41,939.04 divided by $103,251.67) of any 
recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this 
example, the losses were recovered after the claim has been paid by CCC, 
Sec. 1493.520(b) would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.530  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to 
such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment 
must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already 
paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless 
approved in advance by CCC, be:
    (i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties; or
    (ii) Subject to further assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be 
ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, CCC will provide notice thereof, to the financial 
institution and to the exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of 
an acknowledgment of assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
entity issuing the importer obligation.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial institution:

[[Page 830]]

    (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in 
sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
entity issuing the importer obligation.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees. CCC may, with 
the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under 
the payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the 
exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for 
the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other 
than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those 
alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in 
rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the 
payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the 
amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment 
guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, must 
maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and 
deliveries of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with a payment guarantee, including those records 
generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and related 
companies involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The 
Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United 
States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and 
complete access to the premises of the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the 
effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such 
five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the 
exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's, or 
related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions 
relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, 
financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, 
processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and 
unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized 
representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside 
the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain 
directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in 
connection with the payment guarantee.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by Sec. 
1493.490(b), and must provide access to such documentation if requested 
by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the 
five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and Notices to 
Participants issued pursuant to this subpart. Applicants for payment 
guarantees are hereby on notice that they will be bound by any terms 
contained in applicable Program Announcements or Notices to Participants 
issued prior to the date of approval of a payment guarantee.
    (g) Submission of documents by principal officers. All required 
submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or 
requests (i.e., requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' 
assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of 
the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In 
cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal or the 
officer, the signature must be accompanied by: Wording indicating the 
delegation of authority or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of 
the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized 
person or officer. Further, the exporter or exporter's assignee must 
ensure that all information/reports required under these regulations are 
submitted within the required time limits. If requested in writing, CCC 
will acknowledge receipt of a submission by

[[Page 831]]

the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment of receipt is 
requested, the exporter or exporter's assignee must submit an extra copy 
of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope for return by

Sec. 1494.10  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) Export Enhancement Program 
(EEP). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered together 
in order to select eligible commodities and eligible countries for EEP 
initiatives which will best meet the program's objectives. The 
objectives of the program are to discourage unfair trade practices by 
other countries, to increase U.S. agricultural commodity exports, and to 
encourage other countries exporting agricultural commodities to 
undertake serious negotiations on agricultural trade problems. Under the 
EEP, bonuses are made available by CCC to enable exporters to meet 
prevailing world prices for targeted commodities in targeted 
destinations. In the operation of the EEP, CCC will make reasonable 
efforts to avoid the displacement of usual marketings of U.S. 
agricultural commodities.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.20  Criteria.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for 
initiatives will include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) The expected contribution of proposed initiatives in furthering 
trade policy negotiations and, in particular, in furthering the U.S. 
trade policy negotiating strategy of countering competitors' subsidies 
and other unfair trade practices by displacing such

[[Page 832]]

countries' subsidized exports in targeted countries;
    (b) The contribution which initiatives will make toward realizing 
U.S. agricultural export goals and, in particular, in developing, 
expanding, or maintaining markets for U.S. agricultural commodities;
    (c) The effect that sales facilitated by initiatives would have on 
non-subsidizing exporters of agricultural products; and
    (d) The subsidy requirements of proposed initiatives compared to the 
expected benefits.


<R04>
             Subpart B_Export Enhancement Program Operations

    Authority: 15 U.S.C. 714c; 7 U.S.C. 5602, 5651, 5661, 5662, 5676.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.101  General statement.

    This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the 
Export Enhancement Program (EEP) of the Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC). CCC will, from time to time, announce, through public press 
release, initiatives to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural 
commodities to targeted markets. The public press release, which will 
contain the name of a person for interested parties to contact, will be 
followed by the issuance of an Invitation for Offers (Invitation). 
Invitations will be issued pursuant to this subpart by the General Sales 
Manager (GSM) and will specify the eligible country(ies) (the targeted 
market), the unit of measure, the eligible commodity, the maximum 
quantity of the eligible commodity eligible for a CCC bonus, the quality 
specifications of the eligible commodity (including possible 
restrictions on type, kind, grade and/or class or other quality 
specifications), the eligible buyer(s), the method and rate for 
determining liquidated damages and performance security requirements, 
and any other terms and conditions peculiar to that Invitation. 
Invitations may be one of the following two types: Those inviting 
exporters which have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to submit a 
competitive offer for a CCC Bonus; and those inviting exporters which 
have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to apply for an Announced 
CCC Bonus. After an interested person has qualified to submit an offer 
for an eligible commodity, the eligible exporter may submit an offer to 
CCC in response to an Invitation. Such offer must contain the 
information required by this subpart and any additional information 
required by the applicable Invitation. The exporter's offer will include 
either the Announced CCC Bonus, if applicable, or an amount in dollars 
and cents for a bonus deemed necessary by the exporter to make a 
commercial sale of the eligible commodity for export to the eligible 
country competitive with export sales of the commodity by other 
exporting countries to buyers in the eligible country. If the exporter 
has furnished the required performance security and the offer is 
acceptable to CCC, then CCC will notify the exporter that its offer has 
been accepted. CCC and the exporter will enter into an Agreement in 
which CCC will agree to pay the bonus to the exporter in return for the 
exporter's submission of proof that the eligible commodity has been 
exported from the United States and entered into the eligible country, 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 1494.301  Information required for program participation.

    Before CCC will consider an offer from an interested person, such 
person must qualify for participation in the program. Based upon 
information submitted by the interested person and available from public 
sources, CCC will determine whether the interested person is eligible 
for participation in the program.
    (a) Submission of documentation. An interested person that wishes to 
qualify as an eligible exporter must furnish the following information 
or documentation to CCC at the address referenced in the Notice to 
Exporters--EEP Contacts:
    (1) The address of the interested person's office and the name and 
address of an agent in the U.S. for the service of process;
    (2) The legal form of doing business of the interested person, e.g., 
sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, etc.;
    (3) The place of incorporation of the interested person, if the 
interested person is a corporation;
    (4) The name and address of an office(s) of the interested person 
within the U.S., if the interested person is a foreign corporation or 
other foreign entity; and
    (5) A certified statement describing the interested person's 
participation, if any, during the past three years in U.S. Government 
programs, contracts or agreements.
    (6) The following certification: ``I certify, to the best of my 
knowledge and belief, that neither [name of interested person] nor any 
of its principals has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for 
debarment from contracting with or participating in programs 
administered by any U.S. Government agency. [``Principals,'' for the 
purpose of this certification, means officers; directors; owners of five 
percent or more of stock; partners; and persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibility within a business entity (e.g., 
general manager, plant manager, head of a subsidiary division or 
business segment, and similar positions).] I further agree that, should 
any such debarment, suspension, or notice of proposed debarment occur in 
the future, [name of interested person] will immediately notify CCC.''
    (b) Necessity to qualify. An interested person may not submit an 
offer, and CCC will not consider any such offer, until CCC has notified 
the interested person that such person has qualified as an eligible 
exporter.
    (c) Additional submissions. CCC will promptly notify interested 
persons that have submitted information required by this section whether 
they have qualified to have their offers considered. Any person failing 
to qualify will be notified of the basis of CCC's decision and will be 
given an opportunity to provide additional information for consideration 
by CCC.
    (d) Previous performance. CCC may request additional information 
with respect to the interested person's performance under any U.S. 
Government programs or in connection with any contracts or agreements 
with the U.S. Government during the past three years.
    (e) Ineligibility for program participation. A person may be 
ineligible to participate in the EEP if such person:
    (1) Is currently debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment from 
contracting with or participating in any program administered by a U.S. 
Government agency; or
    (2) Is controlled or can be controlled, in whole or in part, by any 
individuals or entities currently debarred, suspended or proposed for 
debarment from contracting with or participating in

[[Page 836]]

programs administered by a U.S. Government agency.
    (f) Duty to update information provided to CCC. An eligible exporter 
is under a continuing obligation to inform CCC of any changes in the 
information or documentation submitted to CCC pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section and to provide current and accurate information to CCC.
    (g) Payment of bonus to exporters without proven EEP participation. 
An eligible exporter that has not yet demonstrated its ability to 
participate successfully in the EEP will be eligible to receive a bonus 
payment(s) only after the eligible commodity specified in an EEP 
Agreement has entered into the eligible country. Such an exporter must 
furnish performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable 
Invitation and follow the procedure specified in Sec. 1494.701(d) to 
request the payment of the bonus. An eligible exporter may demonstrate 
its ability to participate successfully in the EEP by entering or 
causing to be entered into the eligible country at least 95% of the 
quantity of the eligible commodity specified in any one EEP Agreement. 
CCC will consider that an exporter has proven its ability to participate 
successfully in the EEP as of the date on which CCC pays to the exporter 
a bonus for entry of a quantity that brings the total entered quantity 
for any one EEP Agreement to at least 95%. For all EEP Agreements that 
such exporter enters into with CCC subsequent to that date, the exporter 
may furnish performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable 
Invitation and will be eligible to receive bonus payments in accordance 
with Sec. 1494.701(c).

[56 FR 25011, June 3, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 21039, May 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1494.401  Performance security.

    (a) Requirement to establish performance security. Prior to the 
submission of an offer to CCC in response to an Invitation, an eligible 
exporter must establish performance security, in a form which is 
acceptable to CCC, in order to guarantee the eligible exporter's 
faithful performance of the Agreement. If CCC enters into an Agreement 
with the eligible exporter, this performance security must remain in 
effect until its cancellation or reduction is authorized by CCC pursuant 
to paragraph (f) of this section. An offer made by an eligible exporter 
will not be considered if proof of the establishment of the performance 
security is not made available to CCC by 3 p.m. on the date for which 
the offer is submitted for consideration.
    (b) Form of performance security. The performance security must be 
acceptable to CCC and may be an irrevocable standby letter of credit, a 
bond, or a certified or cashier's check. If a standby letter of credit 
is furnished as performance security, the opening bank may be a U.S. 
bank or a foreign bank. If the standby letter of credit is opened by a 
foreign bank, it must be 100 percent confirmed by a U.S. bank. If a bond 
is furnished as performance security, the surety(ies) must be among 
those appearing on the list of approved sureties maintained by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury. If a cashier's or certified check is 
furnished as performance security, the bank issuing the cashier's or 
certified check must be a U.S. bank.
    (c) Amount of performance security. The amount of the performance 
security to be furnished to CCC in response to a particular Invitation 
will depend upon whether the eligible exporter intends to select 
``Option A'' or ``Option B'' for the timing of the bonus payment. If the 
eligible exporter furnishes performance security under ``Option A'' of 
the applicable Invitation, the eligible exporter may request payment of 
the bonus after export of the eligible commodity but before entry of the 
commodity into the eligible country. If the eligible exporter furnishes 
performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable Invitation, 
the eligible exporter may request payment of the bonus only after the 
exported eligible commodity has entered into the eligible country. The 
applicable Invitation will specify the exact amount of performance 
security for the eligible commodity required under either ``Option A'' 
or ``Option B'' and the method and rate for determining liquidated 
damages. After the exporter and CCC enter into an Agreement, the 
exporter may request CCC to change the performance

[[Page 837]]

security option for an entire Agreement from ``Option B'' to ``Option 
A'' and, if CCC agrees to this change, the exporter will increase the 
performance security amount to the level required by the applicable 
Invitation for ``Option A''.
    (d) Additional security. The exporter shall promptly furnish such 
additional security as CCC may determine is necessary to protect CCC 
under an Agreement if the surety(ies) or obligating bank:
    (1) Becomes unacceptable to the U.S. Government or CCC; and/or
    (2) Fails to furnish reports on its financial condition as required 
by the U.S. Government or CCC.
    (e) Right to funds under the performance security. If CCC enters 
into an Agreement with an exporter under the EEP, CCC will have the 
right to funds from the performance security established by the exporter 
for such Agreement to recover:
    (1) The amount of any bonus paid to the exporter under the Agreement 
if the exporter fails to perform in accordance with such Agreement;
    (2) Any funds owed by the exporter to CCC related to the specific 
EEP Agreement for which the performance security was established, 
including those for liquidated damages, discounts for late performance, 
overpayments made by CCC, storage charges, or other damages or charges 
as determined by CCC; and/or
    (3) Any amounts or funds that could be owed by the exporter to CCC 
in accordance with subparagraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section for 
unfulfilled obligations under the Agreement if the performance security 
should expire prior to the exporter's fulfillment of these obligations. 
Should the exporter fulfill these obligations, in accordance with the 
Agreement, after CCC has drawn upon the performance security, CCC will 
return the funds drawn to the exporter or other appropriate party, as 
determined by CCC. CCC may return the performance security if it 
determines that the exporter is not liable for any damages incurred by 
CCC as a result of the exporter's failure to fulfill its obligations 
under the Agreement and that the exporter will not retain any bonus 
payment which was not earned.
    (f) Cancellation or reduction of performance security. (1) CCC will 
agree, upon request by the exporter, to a cancellation of the 
performance security established for an Agreement when CCC determines, 
on the basis of evidence provided by the exporter or other evidence 
available to CCC, that:
    (i) The exporter has fully performed under the Agreement;
    (ii) The exporter has fully compensated CCC for all costs incurred 
or damages suffered by CCC, unless CCC has determined to hold the 
exporter harmless for such damages pursuant to Sec. 1494.801(d) as a 
result of the exporter's nonperformance of the Agreement; or
    (iii) It is no longer in the best interest of the EEP to require the 
exporter to maintain the performance security, and the exporter submits 
to CCC a written statement agreeing that all other terms and conditions 
of the Agreement will remain unchanged pending final resolution of the 
exporter's liabilities to CCC.
    (2) To support a request for the cancellation of performance 
security furnished in connection with an Agreement, the exporter must 
provide to CCC evidence of the export of the eligible commodity as 
provided by Sec. 1494.701(c), and the entry of the eligible commodity 
into the eligible country or countries. The entry certification must be 
in English or accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable 
to CCC. To show entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible 
country, the exporter must furnish to CCC an original certification 
signed by a duly authorized customs or port official of the eligible 
country, by the eligible buyer, by an agent or representative of the 
vessel or shipline which delivered the eligible commodity to the 
eligible country, or by a private surveyor in the target country or 
other documentation deemed acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (i) That the eligible commodity entered the eligible country;
    (ii) The identification of the export carrier;
    (iii) The quantity of the eligible commodity unloaded;

[[Page 838]]

    (iv) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the eligible commodity; 
and
    (v) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the eligible commodity 
in the eligible country.
    (3) If the exporter makes multiple shipments against a sales 
contract with an eligible buyer, CCC may agree to a proportional 
reduction in the amount of the required performance security when the 
exporter has furnished evidence that the exporter has performed under 
the Agreement with respect to a particular shipment.
    (4) Upon the payment of liquidated damages by an exporter to CCC 
under a specific Agreement or the determination by CCC, pursuant to 
Sec. 1494.801(d), to hold the exporter harmless for the payment of 
liquidated damages owed to CCC under a specific Agreement, CCC will 
allow the exporter to cancel or reassign that portion of the performance 
security opened for such specific Agreement that would relate to the 
value of the liquidated damages.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.501  Submission of offers to CCC.

    (a) Consideration of offers. Unless otherwise specified in the 
Invitation, CCC will consider offers on a daily basis from the date of 
issuance of the Invitation until such time that CCC announces that 
offers will no longer be accepted under the Invitation, the total 
quantity of the eligible commodity announced in the Invitation has been 
awarded, or the Invitation has expired as indicated by the expiration 
date shown in the Invitation.
    (1) Prior to the submission of an offer to CCC, the eligible 
exporter must have entered into a sales contract, as defined in Sec. 
1494.201(bb), with an eligible buyer for the export sale and the 
delivery of the eligible commodity to the eligible country.
    (2) The date of sale of the eligible exporter's sales contract with 
an eligible buyer must be after the issuance date of the applicable 
Invitation.
    (3) The sales contract between the eligible exporter and an eligible 
buyer may be conditioned upon the eligible exporter's entering into an 
Agreement with CCC under the EEP for the payment of a bonus.
    (4) CCC will not be responsible to any person for any loss caused by 
the failure of the eligible exporter to obtain a CCC bonus.
    (5) The eligible exporter must promptly notify CCC in writing of any 
amendment to the sales contract with an eligible buyer.
    (b) Submission of offers. Eligible exporters must submit offers, or 
modifications or withdrawals thereof, to the address, telephone, telex 
or facsimile numbers specified in the Notice to Exporters--Contacts for 
EEP. Telephonic offers must be confirmed in writing immediately 
thereafter by telex or facsimile. If a telephonic offer is not confirmed 
in writing by 9 a.m. on the next business day, the offer will not be 
considered. The date and time affixed to submissions will be as 
determined by CCC.
    (c) Content of offers. Offers to CCC for a CCC bonus under the EEP 
must contain the information shown below in the same numerical order as 
shown below. CCC reserves the right to reject any offer that so 
materially departs from this prescribed format that its consideration 
would hinder the offer review process. The applicable Invitation may 
require the submission of further information necessary for the 
consideration of an offer.
    (1) The use of the numerical designation assigned to the applicable 
Invitation, which shall signify that the offer is submitted subject to 
all the terms and conditions of this subpart and the Invitation in 
response to which the offer is being submitted for consideration by CCC.
    (2) The date and time for which the offer is submitted for 
consideration. The time shall be stated as ``after 3 p.m.'' For example, 
the information required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section 
could be stated as follows: ``Invitation No. GSM-500-1, Revision No. X, 
For Consideration After 3 p.m. on August 1, 1991.''
    (3) The full business name and address of the eligible exporter 
making the offer.

each unit of measure of the eligible commodity to be exported to the 
eligible country. The offer shall contain only one CCC bonus. In offers 
submitted in response to an Invitation in which CCC has announced the 
bonus amount, the eligible exporter shall state the dollar and cents 
amount of the Announced CCC Bonus.
    (7) The quantity, on a net weight basis, (less any dockage, if 
applicable) of the eligible commodity for which the eligible exporter 
wishes to receive a CCC bonus pursuant to an EEP Agreement. This 
quantity shall be exclusive of tolerances and expressed in the unit of 
measure specified in the applicable Invitation. This quantity may be 
less than the sales contract quantity.
    (8) The U.S. coast of export. The Invitation may require the 
eligible exporter to indicate: The coasts of export if more than one 
coast of export is allowed for an offer; the Canadian port if the 
eligible commodity is to be transshipped through a Canadian port on the 
St. Lawrence River; or the U.S. city and state from which the shipments 
will cross the border into the eligible country if the eligible 
commodity is to be shipped by rail or truck.
    (9) The quality of the eligible commodity to be exported to the 
eligible buyer, if required by the applicable Invitation, including any 
additional quality specifications not found in the Invitation but 
included in the tender specifications by the eligible buyer or the sales 
contract with the eligible buyer. The Invitation may limit an offer to 
one or more quality designations for the eligible commodity.
    (10) The names of the eligible buyer and the eligible country.

terms (e.g., GSM-102, GSM-103, or other credit arrangements); and, if 
required by the applicable Invitation, the discharge port. The possible 
credit payment terms referenced in an offer are for CCC's information 
only and are not to be construed as a contingency for consideration or 
acceptance. The eligible exporter is fully responsible for the 
arrangement of such payment terms independently from the EEP offer and 
CCC bears no responsibility if such credit payment terms cannot be 
secured.
    (16) The delivery period specified in the sales contract expressed 
on the basis of either shipment from the United States or the Canadian 
transshipment port or arrival in the eligible country. If an arrival 
period is shown, the offer must also indicate an anticipated shipment 
period. If a multiple month delivery schedule is agreed upon in the 
sales contract the offer must specify the quantity of the eligible 
commodity to be delivered each month or at other specified intervals.
    (17) Any options which may be exercised by the eligible buyer under 
the sales contract. If the offer is accepted by CCC, the exporter must 
immediately inform CCC if any such options are exercised by the buyer.

contract.

be in the best interests of the EEP.
    (d) Conditional offers. Any qualification or condition in, or added 
to, the offer and not expressly authorized by this subpart or the

<R05>
Sec. 1494.601  Acceptance of offers by CCC.

    (a) Establishment of acceptable sales prices and CCC bonuses. For 
each Invitation, CCC will establish sales prices for the eligible 
commodity and CCC bonus amounts which would be acceptable to CCC in 
terms of furthering the objectives of the EEP.
    (1) In establishing acceptable sales prices for the eligible 
commodity, CCC will consider available relevant market data.
    (2) In determining acceptable CCC bonus amounts, CCC may take into 
consideration factors such as, but not limited to, the following: The 
prevailing domestic market price of the eligible commodity; the price of 
the same agricultural commodity exported by other exporting countries to 
the eligible country; ocean freight rates for the export of the eligible 
commodity from the U.S. and other exporting countries to the eligible 
country; the particular preferences or purchasing practices of buyers in 
the eligible country which would customarily affect the acceptability of 
the eligible commodity relative to that of competing exports of the same 
agricultural commodity to the eligible country from other exporting 
countries; and the cost effectiveness of the payment of a CCC bonus 
amount in view of CCC's obligation to maximize the use of resources 
available for the operation of the EEP.
    (3) The acceptable sales prices and bonus amounts will be modified 
by CCC as necessary to take advantage of updated information that 
becomes available to CCC.
    (b) Acceptance of offers for a CCC bonus on a competitive basis. An 
offer from an eligible exporter for a CCC bonus on a competitive bonus 
that meets all of the requirements of this subpart will first be 
reviewed to determine if the offer contains an acceptable sales price. 
If the sales price contained in the offer is found to be acceptable, 
then the CCC bonus contained in the offer will be reviewed to determine 
if the CCC bonus requested is found to be acceptable. Offers with 
acceptable sales prices and acceptable CCC bonuses will be accepted 
under each Invitation beginning with the offer having the lowest CCC 
bonus amount, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (f) and (h) of 
this section.
    (c) Acceptance of offers for an announced CCC bonus. Offers from 
eligible exporters for an Announced CCC Bonus that meet all of the 
requirements of this subpart and which contain an acceptable sales price 
will be accepted under each Invitation on a first-come, first-served 
basis according to the time of receipt of the offer, as determined by 
CCC, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this 
section.
    (d) Notification of acceptance of offers. CCC will notify an 
eligible exporter by telephone of the acceptance or rejection of its 
offer as soon as possible after review of the exporter's offer by CCC 
but not later than 10 a.m. of the next business day after the date the 
offer was submitted for consideration. If an offer is rejected, CCC will 
notify the eligible exporter of the basis for the rejection. Acceptance 
of offers will be confirmed in writing. The date of the telephonic 
notification of acceptance by CCC of the eligible exporter's offer will 
be the effective date of the exporter's Agreement with CCC.
    (e) Announcement of acceptance of offers. CCC will generally 
announce the acceptance of offers by public press release as soon as 
possible after the notification to the exporter. The announcement will 
generally include the eligible commodity, the eligible country, the 
exporter, the delivery period, the CCC bonus, and, if applicable, the 
class of the eligible commodity.

[[Page 842]]

    (f) Limitation on acceptance of offers. The total quantity of the 
eligible commodity, exclusive of tolerances, to be exported under all 
offers that are accepted by CCC pursuant to a particular Invitation will 
not be greater than the total quantity of the eligible commodity stated 
in such Invitation. CCC may refuse to accept further offers under an 
applicable Invitation if the quantity of the eligible commodity, 
exclusive of tolerances, already accepted totals the quantity, exclusive 
of tolerances, that is being tendered for by the eligible buyer, even 
though such quantity may be less than the total quantity available under 
that Invitation.
    (g) Rejection of offers. Any offer or part of an offer submitted for 
consideration that is not accepted by CCC by 10 a.m. of the next 
business day after the date for which the offer was submitted for 
consideration will be deemed to have been rejected.
    (h) CCC's right of rejection. Notwithstanding any other provisions 
of this subpart, CCC reserves the right to reject any or all offers 
submitted for consideration on a particular day, including those offers 
that have acceptable sales prices and CCC bonus amounts.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.701  Payment of bonus.

    (a) Forms of bonus. The bonus may be paid to the exporter in CCC 
Certificates or in any other form specified in the applicable Invitation 
which CCC determines to be appropriate.
    (b) Quantity on which bonus is paid. The quantity of the eligible 
commodity exported from the U.S. which is eligible for the payment of a 
CCC bonus is the net weight (less any dockage, if applicable) or count 
which is established by the Official Inspection Certificate, the 
Official Weight Certificate or the export bill of lading, whichever is 
less. If the exporter has furnished performance security under ``Option 
A'' of the applicable Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid prior 
to the entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible country, this 
quantity will be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of 
making payment to the exporter. If the exporter is not paid the bonus 
until the commodity enters into the eligible country, then this quantity 
will also be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of 
making payment to the exporter, unless in the determination of CCC, 
there is evidence to suggest that there was destruction, diversion or 
loss of the eligible commodity prior to entry into the eligible country. 
The payment of a bonus value to an exporter does not indicate that the 
bonus has been earned by the exporter under the Agreement; pursuant to 
Sec. 1494.801(a)(3), the bonus is not earned by the exporter until the 
eligible commodity enters into the eligible country in accordance with 
the Agreement and the exporter submits proof of such entry to CCC.
    (c) Request for bonus payment under ``Option A.'' If the exporter 
has furnished performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable 
Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid after export of the eligible 
commodity, the exporter must, within 30 calendar days after the date of 
export of the eligible commodity, furnish to the Director, at the 
address referenced in the Notice to Exporters--Contacts for EEP, a 
written request for payment of the bonus. All documents submitted to 
support such a request must be acceptable to the Director.
    (1) To support each bonus payment request, the exporter must furnish 
to the Director the following:
    (i) The original or an original copy of the on-board bill of lading 
issued for the export carrier and signed by an agent of the export 
carrier. The bill of lading must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity;
    (D) An on-board date; and
    (E) That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible 
country.
    (ii) The original or an original copy of the Official Weight 
Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate 
must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time 
of issuance;
    (B) The date and place of issuance; and
    (C) The weight or count of the eligible commodity.

[[Page 843]]

    (iii) The original or an original copy of the Official Inspection 
Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate 
must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time 
of issuance;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity to which the certificate 
relates; and
    (D) The quality description of the eligible commodity.
    (iv) If the documents submitted under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section do not specify the export carrier, the exporter 
must also submit a signed certification that the commodity represented 
by the Official Inspection and/or the Official Weight certificates is 
the identical eligible commodity represented on the export bill of 
lading.
    (2) If the export of the eligible commodity was by lash barge, the 
exporter must furnish, in addition to the documents required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a statement from the vessel's agent 
showing that the lash barge was loaded to the lash vessel named in the 
on-board lash bill of lading and that the eligible commodity is destined 
for the eligible country.
    (3) If the export of the eligible commodity was from a Canadian 
transshipment port on the St. Lawrence River, the exporter must furnish 
to the Director the following, in addition to the documents required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
    (i) Documentary evidence covering the movement of the eligible 
commodity from the United States to the export carrier described in the 
on-board bill of lading issued at the Canadian transshipment port and 
showing the information provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and, if 
applicable, (c)(2) of this section; and
    (ii) A certification that the eligible commodity exported is the 
identical eligible commodity that was shipped from the United States.
    (4) If the export of the eligible commodity was by railcar or truck, 
the exporter must furnish to the Director the following, in addition to 
the documents required by paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section:
    (i) The authenticated landing certificate or similar document issued 
by the government of the eligible country; and
    (ii) The original or an original copy of the bill of lading issued 
at the point of loading the railcar or truck. The bill of lading must 
show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity;
    (D) The date that the railcar or truck was loaded; and
    (E) That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible 
country.
    (d) Request for bonus payment under ``Option B.'' If the exporter 
has furnished performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable 
Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid after the entry of the 
exported eligible commodity into the eligible country, the exporter 
must, within 60 calendar days after the date of entry of the eligible 
commodity into the eligible country, furnish to the Director at the 
address referenced in the Notice to Exporters--Contracts for EEP, a 
written request for payment of the bonus. To support each request, the 
exporter must furnish to the Director, in a form acceptable to the 
Director, the documents specified in paragraph (c) of this section, as 
applicable, along with the certification of entry specified in Sec. 
1494.401(f)(2).
    (e) Time frame for payment of a bonus. CCC will endeavor to pay the 
bonus to the exporter within 10 business days after CCC determines that 
the documents supporting the bonus request are acceptable.
    (f) Certificate amount. If CCC decides to pay the bonus in the form 
of a CCC Certificate(s), the dollar value of the certificate(s) issued 
to the exporter will be determined by multiplying the CCC bonus 
specified in the Agreement by the net quantity of the eligible commodity 
on which the bonus is to be paid, as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, less any dockage if applicable.
    (g) Late requests for bonus payment. If CCC decides to pay the bonus 
in the form of a CCC Certificate(s) and the exporter fails to request 
issuance of the certificate(s) within 30 calendar days

[[Page 844]]

after the date of export of the eligible commodity, if the exporter has 
chosen performance security ``Option A,'' or within 60 days after the 
entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible country, if the 
exporter has chosen performance security ``Option B'', CCC may, upon 
issuing the certificate(s), discount the certificate(s) in an amount 
determined appropriate by CCC to compensate it for costs which may be 
incurred by CCC as a result of the exporter's delay.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.801  Enforcement and termination of agreements with CCC.

    (a) Performance in accordance with an Agreement with CCC. (1) An 
exporter which enters into an Agreement with CCC must ensure that the 
eligible commodity is exported from the U.S. and enters the eligible 
country in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
    (2) The diversion of the eligible commodity to a country other than 
the eligible country is prohibited. Transshipments of the eligible 
commodity are permitted only if specifically allowed in the applicable 
Invitation or for shipment through a Canadian transshipment port on the 
St. Lawrence River if the eligible commodity had been shipped from the 
United States via the Great Lakes coastal range and its identity had 
been preserved until shipped from Canada.
    (3) Regardless of whether or not a bonus has been paid by CCC to the 
exporter pursuant to Sec. 1494.701, the bonus is not earned by the 
exporter until the eligible commodity enters into the eligible country 
in accordance with the Agreement. In order to retain a bonus or request 
payment of a bonus, depending upon the option chosen for furnishing 
performance security, and to request cancellation of the performance 
security, the exporter must provide evidence to CCC, as specified in 
Sec. 1494.401(f)(2), that the eligible commodity entered into the 
eligible country. If, on the basis of evidence available to it, CCC 
determines that there was destruction, diversion or loss of the eligible 
commodity prior to entry into the eligible country, CCC will not release 
the amount of performance security corresponding to the amount of 
eligible commodity for which insufficient evidence of entry into the 
eligible country was presented to CCC until:
    (i) CCC recovers from the exporter the amount of the bonus 
corresponding to such amount of the eligible commodity, if the exporter 
has already been paid the bonus under performance security ``Option A''; 
and
    (ii) The requirements of either Sec. 1494.401(f)(1)(ii) or Sec. 
1494.401(f)(1)(iii) have been met.
    (4) The failure of an exporter to perform in full and to fulfill all 
of its obligations under the Agreement will constitute a breach of the 
Agreement. An exporter which breaches the Agreement may be required to 
forfeit its right to receive or retain part or all of the bonus 
authorized or paid under the Agreement and may also be liable to CCC for 
damages. Examples of an exporter's failure to perform under the 
Agreement include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) The exporter does not ship all of the required amount of the 
eligible commodity in accordance with the delivery period stated in the 
Agreement;
    (ii) The exporter exports an amount of the eligible commodity that 
is inconsistent with the quality specifications in the Agreement;
    (iii) The exporter is unable to provide a certification that all of 
the eligible commodity exported pursuant to the Agreement was entered 
into the eligible country;
    (iv) The eligible commodity is transshipped through any country, 
other than Canada, unless specifically allowed in the applicable 
Invitation; or
    (v) The eligible commodity is transshipped through Canada without 
having its identity preserved.
    (5) If the eligible commodity is to be delivered to the eligible 
buyer in multiple shipments, CCC may decide to consider the shipments 
separately in determining whether the exporter has failed to perform 
under the Agreement.
    (b) Return of bonus. An exporter that fails to fulfill all of its 
obligations under the Agreement shall be in default. If an exporter that 
has already been paid the bonus value defaults, CCC shall have the right 
to recover the bonus value paid for the quantity of the eligible 
commodity with respect to

[[Page 845]]

which the exporter failed to perform under the Agreement.
    (1) If CCC has paid this bonus value in the form of a CCC 
Certificate(s), the exporter shall pay to CCC the higher of:
    (i) The dollar value of the CCC Certificate(s);
    (ii) The dollar amount received for the CCC Certificate(s) if the 
CCC Certificate(s) was transferred to another party; or
    (iii) The dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of the CCC-
owned commodities exchanged for the CCC Certificate(s) if the 
commodities were sold to another party.
    (2) If CCC has paid this bonus value in some other form, as 
specified in the applicable Invitation, the exporter shall pay to CCC 
the dollar and cents amount or equivalent of the bonus value paid to the 
exporter.
    (c) Liability for liquidated damages. The exporter's failure to 
perform under the Agreement will cause serious and substantial losses to 
CCC, such as damages to the EEP and CCC's domestic price support 
program, storage charges, and administrative and other costs incurred. 
If the exporter breaches the Agreement, the exporter will be liable to 
pay to CCC as liquidated damages an amount obtained by applying the 
method or rate for determining damages specified in the applicable 
Invitation to the quantity of the eligible commodity with respect to 
which the exporter failed to perform under such Agreement. In submitting 
an offer in response to an Invitation issued under this subpart, the 
exporter agrees that such liquidated damages are reasonable estimates of 
the probable actual damages which may be incurred by CCC.
    (d) Decision to hold the exporter harmless for liquidated damages. 
CCC will hold an exporter harmless for the payment of liquidated damages 
if:
    (1) The exporter's failure to perform under the Agreement was due to 
causes solely without the exporter's fault or negligence and the 
exporter had taken the necessary action to enable it to export the 
required quantity of the eligible commodity and enter it into the 
eligible country; or
    (2) The eligible commodity was lost or destroyed after it had been 
placed aboard the export carrier.

In making the decision whether to hold an exporter harmless pursuant to 
this paragraph, CCC may consider any information available to CCC, 
including any information provided to it by the exporter.
    (e) Fraud, scheme or device. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, CCC may take action to recover any bonus paid or to hold the 
exporter liable for the payment of damages caused to CCC if the exporter 
engages in fraud with respect to the EEP, or adopts or participates in 
adopting a scheme or device which is designed to evade this subpart or 
which has the effect of evading this subpart. Such acts shall include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Concealing information which is required by this subpart; or
    (2) Submitting information which is known by the exporter to be 
false or erroneous.
    (f) CCC's right to recover amounts due CCC by exporters. If the 
exporter breaches its obligations under the Agreement and becomes liable 
to CCC for repayment of the bonus value or for liquidated or other 
damages, CCC reserves the right to recover such amounts due CCC by 
making a claim against the performance security furnished to CCC, as 
described under Sec. 1494.401, or by taking any other measures 
available to CCC as a result of this subpart or any laws or regulations, 
including debt settlement regulations, applicable to CCC.
    (g) Shipping tolerances. If the exporter exports and enters into the 
eligible country, in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement, 
a quantity of the eligible commodity which is less than the quantity 
specified in Sec. 1494.501(c)(7) but not less than such quantity minus 
5 percent, the exporter shall not be required to pay liquidated damages 
for failure to perform under the Agreement for the quantity which failed 
to be exported and entered into the eligible country. If an exporter 
exports and enters into the eligible country, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Agreement, a quantity of the eligible commodity 
which is greater than the quantity specified in

[[Page 846]]

Sec. 1494.501(c)(7), the exporter may request payment of the bonus 
value based upon the actual quantity, on a net weight basis, exported 
and entered into the eligible country, but not greater than the quantity 
specified in Sec. 1494.501(c)(7), plus 5 percent.
    (h) Termination of agreements. (1) CCC may, by written notice to the 
exporter, terminate an Agreement, in whole or in part, as a result of:
    (i) the failure of the exporter to carry out any provisions of the 
Agreement;
    (ii) the failure of the exporter to maintain a business office in 
the U.S.;
    (iii) the failure of the exporter to maintain an agent in the U.S. 
for service of process; or
    (iv) the suspension or debarment of the exporter from participation 
in CCC or other U.S. Government programs.

If an Agreement is terminated by CCC pursuant to this subparagraph, CCC 
will not compensate the exporter for any costs incurred by the exporter. 
The exporter will be liable to CCC for any funds owed to CCC for the 
repayment of any bonus already paid and may be liable to CCC for 
liquidated or other damages suffered by CCC. If CCC intends to hold the 
exporter liable for liquidated damages, and it has not already so 
notified the exporter prior to the termination of the Agreement, CCC 
will generally do so at the time that it notifies the exporter of the 
termination of the Agreement.
    (2) CCC may, by written notice to the exporter, terminate an 
Agreement, in whole or in part, if CCC determines it to be in the best 
interest of CCC. If an agreement is so terminated, the exporter will be 
compensated for reasonable losses, as determined by CCC, resulting from 
such termination. These losses will not include lost profits and will 
not exceed the bonus value under the Agreement.
    (i) Amendment of agreements. (1) CCC will have the authority to 
amend an Agreement, either before or after such Agreement has been 
breached by the exporter, if the exporter requests that the Agreement be 
amended and CCC determines that such amendment would serve the best 
interests of the EEP. The exporter may be required to submit documentary 
evidence to CCC to demonstrate that it is making progress toward 
fulfilling the Agreement before CCC will consider amending the 
Agreement. All requests for amendments submitted by exporters, and all 
amendments made by CCC to an Agreement, under this subpart shall be in 
writing.
    (2) Prior to amending an Agreement with the exporter, CCC will 
consider whether the amendment to the Agreement should include a 
reduction in the CCC bonus or a modification of the sales price. If CCC 
determines that the CCC bonus and the sales price are still acceptable, 
it may amend the Agreement to incorporate the exporter's requested 
change, while maintaining the current CCC bonus and sales price, 
provided that the amendment would otherwise serve the best interests of 
the EEP. If CCC determines that the CCC bonus and/or the sales price are 
no longer acceptable, due to changes in market or other conditions, it 
will so inform the exporter. If the exporter still requests that the 
Agreement be amended, CCC and the exporter will enter into discussions 
in an attempt to arrive at a new CCC bonus and/or sales price which 
would be acceptable to CCC. If these discussions are successful, then 
CCC may amend the Agreement to incorporate the exporter's requested 
change as well as the new CCC bonus and/or sales price, provided that 
the amendment would otherwise serve the best interests of the EEP. If 
these discussions are unsuccessful, then the Agreement will not be 
amended and the exporter will be considered to be in breach of the 
Agreement if it fails to perform under the terms of the Agreement.
    (j) Amendments to sales contracts. In the event of an amendment to 
the sales contract between the exporter and the eligible buyer or a 
change in the delivery schedule, CCC will determine whether the 
amendment or change would constitute a breach of the Agreement. If CCC 
determines that the amendment or change would constitute a breach of the 
Agreement, CCC may terminate the Agreement. In the alternative, if CCC 
determines that a continuation of the Agreement would serve the best 
interests of the EEP, and if the exporter requests an amendment, CCC may 
amend the Agreement to take into account the amendment to the

[[Page 847]]

sales contract or change in delivery schedule. An amendment to an 
Agreement will be in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section. 
CCC will promptly advise the exporter of its determination in writing by 
letter, facsimile, or telex.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.901  Dispute resolution and appeals.

    (a) Dispute resolution. (1) The Director of the CCC Operations 
Division (Director, CCCOD) and the exporter will attempt to resolve any 
disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising 
under the EEP, this subpart, the applicable Invitation, or the 
Agreement.
    (2) The exporter may seek reconsideration of a determination by the 
Director, CCCOD relating to the Agreement by submitting a letter 
requesting reconsideration to the Director, CCCOD, within 30 days of the 
date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the date of 
a determination will be the date of the letter or other means of 
notification to the exporter of the determination. The exporter may 
include with the letter requesting reconsideration any additional 
information which it wishes the Director, CCCOD, to consider in 
reviewing its request. The Director, CCCOD, will respond to the request 
for reconsideration within 30 days of the date on which the request or 
the final documentary evidence submitted by the exporter is received by 
him, whichever is later, unless the GSM extends the time permitted for 
response. If the exporter fails to request reconsideration of a 
determination by the Director, CCCOD, that the exporter owes any funds 
to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds will become a debt of the 
exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-day period for submitting 
such a request.
    (3) If the exporter requested a reconsideration of a determination 
by the Director, CCCOD, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, 
and the Director, CCCOD, upheld the original determination, then the 
exporter may appeal the determination to the GSM in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the exporter 
fails to appeal the determination to the GSM, then any funds owed to CCC 
will become a debt of the exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-
day period for submitting an appeal to the GSM.
    (b) Appeal procedures. (1) An exporter which has exhausted the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the 
GSM a determination of the Director, CCCOD, relating to the Agreement 
between the exporter and CCC. An appeal to the GSM must be in writing 
and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 days following the 
date of the final determination by the Director, CCCOD. In this appeal 
to the GSM, the exporter shall be entitled to an administrative hearing 
before the GSM, if the exporter indicates in its appeal letter that it 
desires such a hearing.
    (2) If the exporter does not desire an administrative hearing, the 
exporter may submit any additional written information or documentation 
which it desires the GSM to consider in acting upon its appeal. This 
information or documentation may be submitted to the GSM up until the 
time that a decision is made by the GSM. The GSM will base the 
determination upon information contained in the administrative record. 
The GSM will endeavor to make a decision on an appeal not involving a 
hearing within 60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the appeal 
or the date that final documentary evidence is submitted by the exporter 
to the GSM, whichever is later.
    (3) If the exporter has indicated that it desires an administrative 
hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing which is 
mutually convenient for the GSM and the exporter. This date will 
ordinarily be within 60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the 
request for hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure. The 
exporter and/or its counsel may present any administrative or 
documentary evidence to the GSM which it desires to have the GSM 
consider in making a determination. A transcript of the hearing will not 
ordinarily be prepared unless the exporter bears the costs involved in 
preparing the transcript, although the GSM may arrange

[[Page 848]]

to have a transcript prepared at the expense of the Government if it is 
determined to be appropriate. The exporter may provide additional 
written information to the GSM up until the time that the GSM makes a 
determination. The GSM will base the determination upon the information 
contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to make a 
decision within 60 days of the date of the hearing or the date of 
receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared, whichever is later.
    (4) The decision of the GSM will be the final determination of CCC 
and the exporter will be entitled to no further administrative appellate 
rights.
    (5) If the GSM upholds a determination of the Director, CCCOD, that 
the exporter owes any funds to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds 
will become a debt of the exporter to CCC.
    (c) Failure to comply with determination. If, for any reason, the 
exporter has failed to pay funds to CCC which have been determined to be 
owed to CCC under the Agreement and the exporter has exhausted its 
rights under this section or has failed to exercise such rights, then 
CCC will have the right to withdraw funds from the performance security 
established by the exporter or to take any other measures available to 
CCC as result of this subpart or any laws or regulations, including debt 
settlement regulations, applicable to CCC.
    (d) Exporter's obligation to perform. The exporter will continue to 
have an obligation to perform under the Agreement pending the conclusion 
of all procedures under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1001  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignments. The exporter may not assign the Agreement or any 
rights thereunder, including the right to receive a bonus under the 
Agreement.
    (b) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after CCC agrees to the cancellation of an exporter's 
performance security for an Agreement, the exporter must maintain 
accurate records showing sales and deliveries of the eligible commodity 
exported in connection with the Agreement. The Secretary of Agriculture 
and the Comptroller General of the United States, through their 
authorized representatives, will have full and complete access to the 
premises of the exporter during regular business hours from the 
effective date of the Agreement until the expiration of such five-year 
period to inspect, examine, audit and make copies of the exporter's 
books, records and accounts concerning transactions relating to the 
Agreement, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts 
pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and 
incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen. From the effective date of 
the Agreement and until the expiration of such five-year period, the 
exporter may be required to make available to the Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through 
their authorized representatives, records that pertain to transactions 
conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such 
records would pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken 
by the exporter in connection with the performance of an EEP Agreement.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the certification of entry specified 
in Sec. 1494.401(f)(2), and must provide access to such document if 
requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or an authorized 
representative, for the five-year period specified in subparagraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Arrival verification reviews. CCC will review, on an annual 
basis, a sufficient number of exports made in connection with EEP 
Agreements to ensure that the eligible commodity which was exported 
pursuant to each such Agreement arrived in the eligible country 
specified in the Agreement.
    (d) Signatory on certifications. Any certification required from a 
person pursuant to this subpart or an Invitation must be signed by the 
person, if an individual, or by a partner or officer of the person, if 
the person is a partnership or a corporation, respectively.
    (e) Officials not to benefit. No member of or Delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, will participate or share in any of the 
benefits of any Agreement entered into pursuant to the EEP, but this 
provision may not be construed to extend to an Agreement

[[Page 849]]

made by CCC with a corporation for its general benefit.
    (f) Paperwork Reduction Act. The information collection requirements 
contained in this subpart have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 
35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0551-0028.
    (g) Waiver of irregularities. CCC reserves the right to waive any 
informality or minor irregularity with respect to any aspect of the 
operation of the EEP or any Agreement executed thereunder in order to 
best accomplish the purposes of the program.

<R05>
Sec. 1494.1100  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) Dairy Export Incentive Program 
(DEIP). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered together 
in order to select eligible commodities and eligible countries for DEIP 
initiatives which will best meet the program's objectives. The 
objectives of the program are to increase U.S. agricultural commodity 
exports and to encourage other countries exporting agricultural 
commodities to undertake serious negotiations on agricultural trade 
problems. Under the DEIP, bonuses are made available by CCC to enable 
exporters to meet prevailing world prices for targeted dairy products in 
targeted destinations. In the operation of the DEIP, CCC will make 
reasonable efforts to avoid the displacement of commercial export sales 
of U.S. dairy products and to ensure that sales facilitated by the DEIP 
are in addition to, and not in place of, any export sales of dairy 
products that the exporter would have otherwise made in the absence of 
the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1101  Criteria.

    The criteria considered in evaluating and approving proposals for 
the DEIP are those set forth in Sec. 1494.20 of this part.

Sec. 1494.1200  Program operations.

    This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the 
Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC). Under the DEIP, CCC facilitates the export of U.S. 
dairy products by paying bonuses to exporters which export U.S. dairy 
products to targeted markets in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of an Agreement entered into between the exporter and CCC. Except as 
otherwise provided in this subpart, the program operations provisions of 
subpart B of this part, relating to the Export Enhancement Program, will 
also apply to the DEIP. Any terms or conditions applicable to a 
particular Invitation for Offers (Invitation) under the DEIP, beyond 
those terms or conditions set forth in this subpart or subpart B of this 
part, will be specifically provided for in such Invitation.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1201  Paperwork Reduction Act.

and direction of the Executive Vice President of CCC. The program will 
be administered through the Office of the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, FSA, Washington, DC and the Kansas City Commodity 
Office (KCCO), FSA, Kansas City, Missouri. Procurement will be in 
accordance with USDA-1, ``General Terms and Conditions for the

commodity plus transportation charges to the port of discharge.

[44 FR 27407, May 10, 1979, as amended at 52 FR 5728, Feb. 25, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1496.4  Issuance of invitations.

    From time to time, CCC will issue invitations to purchase or process 
agricultural products for utilization in the Title II, Pub. L. 480 
program. The invitations will specify the contract terms; the closing 
date for acceptance of bids; the date contracts will be awarded; and 
other pertinent information. Invitations will be issued at least 10 days 
prior to the deadline for submission of bids. The bid submission 
deadlines and contract awards will be timed so not more than one market 
day elapses between bid opening (bid submission deadline) and contract 
awards.


<R05>
Sec. 1496.5  Consideration of bids.

    (a)(1) Lowest landed cost. The general principle of awarding 
contracts that will result in the lowest landed cost will prevail. 
Lowest landed cost will be calculated on the basis of U.S. flag rates 
and service for that portion of the commodities being purchased that CCC 
determines is necessary and practicable to meet cargo preference 
requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the 
remaining portion of the commodities being purchased. However, the 
additional factors set forth in this section will be considered in 
awarding contracts.
    (b)(1) Availability of ocean service. Prior to receipt of offers 
from commodity suppliers, CCC will review

[[Page 851]]

ocean freight information from available sources including, but not 
limited to, trade journal newspapers, port publications, and steamship 
publications to determine the availability of appropriate ocean service.
    (2) Additional information will be gathered, if necessary by direct 
contact with the steamship company involved, regarding such factors as 
the minimum tonnage and/or revenue required to perform the service 
needed.
    (3) Special emphasis will be placed on assuring that under normal 
conditions the vessels will be calling at U.S. ports to coordinate 
loading with cargo arrival from suppliers.
    (4) Freight rates will be obtained from published ocean tariffs to 
make cost comparisons between various steamship companies and coastal 
ranges.
    (5) Available service will be analyzed to ensure that the port or 
coastal range selected for exportation has available ocean 
transportation service that will provide maximum compliance with the 
stated policy of AID with regard to the utilization of U.S. and other 
flag vessels to carry commodities shipped under Title II, Pub. L. 480.
    (c) Adequacy of service. (1) Prior to the selection of a coastal 
range or U.S. port from which commodities will be shipped, the ocean 
transportation service available may be examined to determine adequacy 
of service. The data utilized may include, but not necessarily be 
limited to, the past performance of a particular vessel or steamship 
line in terms of loss and/or damage to cargo when received at 
destination port; past performance in meeting established delivery 
schedules, etc. CCC may eliminate from consideration ports or coastal 
ranges where ocean transportation service is considered inadequate by 
CCC. When clearly superior service is available at another port or 
coastal range it may be selected over other service.
    (d) Port performance. (1) Each port will be contacted prior to bid 
evaluation to determine their cargo handling capabilities for Title II, 
Pub. L. 480, commodities when it is reasonably expected that quantities 
of 1,000 tons or more may be shipped. Allocations to that port will be 
governed by the minimum or maximum quantities indicated.
    (2) Limits of quantities purchased for delivery to a port or coastal 
range may also be imposed by the amount of vessel space available during 
the expected delivery and loading period.
    (3) Prior to the final selection of a U.S. port from which 
commodities will be shipped, the adequacy of the port to receive, 
accumulate, warehouse, handle, store, and protect the cargo will be 
considered.
    (4) Factors which will be considered in this determination will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the adequacy of building 
structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, 
cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices.
    (5) When it is determined that the U.S. port is congested, 
facilities are overloaded, and a vessel would not be able to dock and 
load cargo without delay, or when labor disputes or lack of labor will 
prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner, 
another coastal range or port will be considered.
    (e) Transit time. CCC will consider total transit time, as it 
relates to a final delivery date, in order to satisfy program 
requirements.
    (f) Great Lakes ports. (1) Commodities offered for delivery ``free 
alongside ship'' (f.a.s.) Great Lakes port range or intermodal bridge-
port Great Lakes port range that represent the overall (foreign and U.S. 
flag) lowest landed cost will be awarded on that basis. Such offers will 
not be reevaluated on a lowest landed cost U.S.-flag basis unless CCC 
determines that 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of bagged, 
processed or fortified commodities furnished under Title II of Public 
Law 480 has been, or will be, transported from the Great Lakes port 
range during that fiscal year.
    (2) CCC will consider commodity offers as offers for delivery 
``intermodal bridge-port Great Lakes port range'' only if:
    (i) The offer specifies delivery at a marine cargo-handling facility 
that is capable of loading ocean going vessels

[[Page 852]]

at a Great Lakes port, as well as loading ocean going conveyances such 
as barges and container vans, and
    (ii) The commodities will be moved from one transportation 
conveyance to another at such a facility.

[44 FR 27407, May 10, 1979, as amended at 52 FR 5729, Feb. 25, 1987; 63 
FR 11104, Mar. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1496.6  Data to be used.

    (a) CCC will use all available historical and current data as a 
basis for procurement considerations, including evaluations and 
decisions regarding the physical facilities and performance of ports. 
Heavy reliance will be placed upon current port conditions as determined 
from first hand observations and reports from USDA and other reliable 
sources.
    (b) The primary source of historical data will be documents used in 
the normal course of conducting business. Sources include contract 
documents, ocean bills of lading, survey and/or outturn reports made by 
commercial cargo surveyors, claim settlement agreements, claim payment 
documents, etc. CCC will utilize only such data and make only those 
analyses that it believes will provide a valid measure of program 
performance.


<R05>
Sec. 1496.7  Final contract determinations.

    The KCCO shall be responsible for making lowest landed cost 
determinations. KCCO shall provide that information to an Ad Hoc 
Committee designated by the Administrator, FSA, to review the lowest 
landed cost determinations as a result of any or all of the factors 
referred to herein. If, after the committee makes its review and it is 
recommended that contracts should be awarded based on the additional 
factors which would override lowest landed cost determinations, these 
recommendations will be presented to the Contracting Officer for a final 
decision. These decisions will be fully doc umented and explained as to 
the reasons the lowest landed cost was not selected.

Sec. 1499.8  Ocean transportation.

    (a) Cargo preference. Shipments of commodities provided under either 
the section 416(b) or Food for Progress programs are subject to the 
requirements of sections 901(b) and 901b of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, regarding carriage on U.S.-flag vessels. CCC will endeavor to meet 
these requirements separately for each program for each 12-month 
compliance period. A Cooperating Sponsor shall comply with the 
instructions of CCC regarding the quantity of commodities that must be 
carried on U.S. flag vessels.
    (b) Freight procurement requirements. When CCC is financing any 
portion of the ocean freight, whether on U.S.-flag or non-U.S. flag 
vessels, and the Cooperating Sponsor arranges ocean transportation:
    (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange ocean transportation 
through competitive bidding and shall obtain approval of all invitations 
for bids from the offices specified in the Program Agreement prior to 
issuance.
    (2) Invitations for bids shall be issued through the Transportation 
News Ticker (TNT), New York, and at least one other comparable means of 
trade communication.
    (3) Freight invitations for bids shall include specified procedures 
for payment of freight, including the party responsible for the freight 
payments, and expressly require that:
    (i) Offers include a contract canceling date no later than the last 
contract layday specified in the invitation for bids;
    (ii) Offered rates be quoted in U.S. dollars per metric ton;
    (iii) If destination bagging or transportation to a point beyond the 
discharge port is required, the offer separately state the total rate 
and the portion thereof attributable to the ocean segment of the 
movement;
    (iv) Any non-liner U.S. flag vessel 15 years or older offer, in 
addition to any other offered rate, a one-way rate applicable in the 
event the vessel is scrapped or transferred to foreign flag registry 
prior to the end of the return voyage to the United States;
    (v) In the case of packaged commodities, U.S. flag carriers specify 
whether delivery will be direct breakbulk shipment, container shipment, 
or breakbulk transshipment and identify whether transshipment (including 
container relays) will be via U.S. or foreign flag vessel;
    (vi) Vessels offered subject to Maritime Administration approval 
will not be accepted; and
    (vii) Offers be received by a specified closing time, which must be 
the same for both U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels.
    (4) In the case of shipments of bulk commodities and non-liner 
shipments of packaged commodities, the Cooperating Sponsor shall open 
offers in public in the United States at the time and place specified in 
the invitation for bids and consider only offers that are responsive to 
the invitation for bids without negotiation. Late offers shall not be 
considered or accepted.
    (5) All responsive offers received for both U.S. flag and foreign 
flag service shall be presented to KCCO which will determine the extent 
to which U.S.-flag vessels will be used.
    (6) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish the Director, 
Public Law 480-OD, or other official specified in the Program Agreement, 
copies of all offers received with the time of receipt indicated 
thereon. The Director, Public Law 480-OD, or other official specified in 
the Program Agreement, will approve all vessel fixtures. The Cooperating 
Sponsor may fix vessels subject to the required approval; however, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall not confirm a vessel fixture until advised of 
the required approval and the results of the Maritime Administration's 
guideline rate review. The Cooperating Sponsor shall not request 
guideline rate advice from the Maritime Administration. The Cooperating 
Sponsor will, promptly after receipt of vessel approval, issue a public 
notice of the fixture details on the TNT or other means of communication 
approved by the Director, Public Law 480-OD.
    (7) Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers may not be employed to 
carry

[[Page 857]]

shipments on either U.S. or foreign-flag vessels.
    (8) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish the Director 
Public Law 480-OD, a copy of the signed laytime statement and statement 
of facts at the discharge port.
    (c) Shipping agents. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor may appoint a

Deputy Administrator, Room 4077-S, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1031, and include a copy 
of the proposed agency agreement. The Cooperating Sponsor shall specify 
the time period of the nomination.
    (2) The shipping agent so nominated shall submit the information and 
certifications required by 7 CFR 17.4 to the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) A person may not act as a shipping agent for a Cooperating 
Sponsor unless the Deputy Administrator has notified the Cooperating 
Sponsor in writing that the nomination is accepted.
    (d) Commissions. (1) When any portion of the ocean freight is paid 
by CCC, total commissions earned on U.S. and foreign flag bookings by 
all parties arranging vessel fixtures, shall not exceed 2\1/2\ percent 
of the total freight costs.
    (2) Address commissions are prohibited.
    (e) Contract terms. When CCC is paying any portion of the ocean 
freight, charter parties and liner booking contracts must conform to the 
following requirements, as applicable:
    (1) Packaged commodities on liner vessels shall be shipped on the 
basis of full berth terms with no demurrage or despatch;
    (2) Shipments of bulk liquid commodities may be contracted in 
accordance with trade custom. Other bulk commodities, including 
shipments that require bagging or stacking for the account of the 
vessel, shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load, free out, with 
demurrage and despatch applicable at load and discharge ports; except 
that, if bulk commodities require further inland distribution, they 
shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load with demurrage and despatch 
at load and berth terms discharge, i.e., no demurrage, despatch, or 
detention at discharge. Demurrage and despatch shall be settled between 
the ocean carrier and commodity suppliers at load port and between the 
ocean carrier and charterers at discharge ports. CCC is not responsible 
for resolving disputes involving the calculation of laytime or the 
payment of demurrage or despatch.
    (3) If the Program Agreement requires the Cooperating Sponsor to 
arrange an irrevocable letter of credit for ocean freight, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable for detention of the vessel for 
loading delays attributable solely to the decision of the ocean carrier 
not to commence loading because of the failure of the Cooperating 
Sponsor to establish such letter of credit. Charter parties and liner 
booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean 
carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention for 
all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, 
including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay 
shall not commence earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the 
designated loading port within the laydays specified in the charter 
party or liner booking contract, and upon notification of the vessel's 
readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the applicable charter 
party or liner booking contract. The period of such delay shall end at 
the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit have been 
established for ocean freight or the time the vessel begins loading, 
whichever is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not count as 
laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no later than 
upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.
    (4) Charges including, but not limited to charges for inspection, 
fumigation, and carrying charges, attributable to the failure of the 
vessel to present before the canceling date will be for the account of 
the ocean carrier.
    (5) Ocean freight is earned under a charter party when the vessel 
and cargo arrive at the first port of discharge, Provided, That if a 
force majeure

[[Page 858]]

prevents the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge, 100% of 
the ocean freight is payable or, if the charter party provides for 
completing additional requirements after discharge such as bagging, 
stacking, or inland transportation, not more than 85% of the ocean 
freight is payable, at the time the General Sales Manager determines 
that such force majeure was the cause of nonarrival; and
    (6) When the ocean carrier offers delivery to destination ports on 
U.S.-flag vessels, but foreign-flag vessels are used for any part of the 
voyage to the destination port without first obtaining the approval of 
the Cooperating Sponsor, KCCO, and any other approval that may be 
required by the Program Agreement, the ocean freight rate will be 
reduced to the lowest responsive foreign-flag vessel rate offered in 
response to the same invitation for bids and the carrier agrees to pay 
CCC the difference between the contracted ocean freight rate and the 
freight rate offered by such foreign-flag vessel.
    (f) Coordination between CCC and the Cooperating Sponsor. When a 
Program Agreement specifies that the Cooperating Sponsor will arrange 
ocean transportation:
    (1) KCCO will furnish the Cooperating Sponsor, or its agent, with a 
Notice of Commodity Availability (Form CCC-512) which will specify the 
receiving country, commodity, quantity, and date at U.S. port or 
intermodal delivery point.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall complete the Form CCC-512 
indicating name of steamship company, vessel name, vessel flag and 
estimated time of arrival at U.S. port; and shall sign and return the 
completed form to KCCO, with a copy to the Director, P.L. 480-OD. If CCC 
agrees to pay any part of the ocean transportation for liner cargoes, 
the Cooperating Sponsor shall also indicate on the Form CCC-512 the 
applicable Federal Maritime Commission tariff rate, and tariff 
identification.
    (3) KCCO will issue instructions to have the commodity delivered 
f.a.s. or f.o.b. vessel, U.S. port of export or intermodal delivery 
point, consigned to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (g) Documents required for payment of freight--(1) General rule. To 
receive payment for ocean freight, the following documents shall be 
submitted to the Director, CCCPSD:
    (i) One signed copy of completed Form CCC-512;
    (ii) Four copies of the original on-board bills of lading indicating

accompanied by a certification from the ocean carrier that payment has 
been received from the Cooperating Sponsor; or
    (B) A request for direct payment to the ocean carrier, indicating 
amount due; or
    (C) A request for direct payment of ocean freight differential to 
the ocean carrier accompanied by a certification from the carrier that 
payment of the Cooperating Sponsor's portion of the ocean freight has 
been received.
    (ix) Each request to CCC for payment must provide a document, on 
letterhead and signed by an official or agent of the requester, the name 
of the entity to receive payment, the bank ABA number to which payment 
is to be

[[Page 859]]

made; the account number for the deposit at the bank; the requester's 
taxpayer identification number; and the type of the account into which 
funds will be deposited.
    (2) In cases of force majeure. To receive payment in cases where the 
General Sales Manager determines that circumstances of force majeure 
have prevented the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall submit all documents required by paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section except for the notice of arrival required by 
paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (h) CCC payment of ocean freight or ocean freight differential--(1) 
General rule. CCC will pay, not later than 30 days after receipt in good 
order of the required documentation, 100 percent of either the ocean 
freight or the ocean freight differential, whichever is specified in the 
Program Agreement.

or liner booking note provide for the completion of additional services 
after discharge, such as bagging, stacking or inland transportation, CCC 
will pay, not later than 30 days after receipt in good order of the 
required documentation, either not more than 85 percent of the total 
freight charges or 100 percent of the ocean freight differential, 
whichever is specified in the Program Agreement. CCC will pay the 
remaining balance, if any, of the freight charges not later than 30 days 
after receipt of notification from the Cooperating Sponsor that such 
additional services have been provided; except that CCC will not pay any 
remaining balance where the GSM determines that the vessel's arrival at 
first port of discharge was prevented by force majeure.
    (3) No demurrage. CCC will not pay demurrage.

<R05>
Sec. 1499.9  Arrangements for entry and handling in the foreign country.

    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor shall make all necessary arrangements 
for receiving the commodities in the recipient country, including 
obtaining appropriate approvals for entry and transit. The Cooperating

at port of entry or point of receipt from originating carrier in good 
condition until their distribution, sale or barter.
    (b) When CCC has agreed to pay costs of transporting, storing, and 
distributing commodities from designated points of entry or ports of 
entry, the Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for such services, by 
through bill of lading, or by contracting directly with suppliers of 
services, as CCC may approve. If the Cooperating Sponsor contracts 
directly with the suppliers of such services, the Cooperating Sponsor 
may seek reimbursement by submitting documentation to CCC indicating 
actual costs incurred. All supporting documentation must be sent to the 
Director, CCCPSD. CCC, at its option, will reimburse the Cooperating 
Sponsor for the cost of such services in U.S. dollars at the exchange

<R05>
Sec. 1499.11  Agreement between Cooperating Sponsor and recipient 
agencies.

    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor shall enter into a written agreement 
with a recipient agency prior to the transfer of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income to the recipient agency. Copies of such 
agreements shall be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, 
and the Director, PDD. Such agreements shall require the recipient 
agency to pay the Cooperating Sponsor the value of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income that are used for purposes not expressly 
permitted under the Program Agreement, or that are lost, damaged, or 
misused as result of the recipient agency's failure to exercise 
reasonable care;
    (b) CCC may waive the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
where it determines that such an agreement is not feasible or 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.12  Sales and barter of commodities provided and use of 
proceeds.

    (a) Commodities may be sold or bartered without the prior approval 
of CCC where damage has rendered the commodities unfit for intended 
program purposes and sale or barter is necessary to mitigate loss of 
value.
    (b) A Cooperating Sponsor may, but is not required to, negotiate an 
agreement with the host government under which the commodities imported 
for a sale or barter may be imported, sold, or bartered without 
assessment of duties or taxes. In such cases and where the commodities 
are sold, they shall be sold at prices reflecting prevailing local 
market value.
    (c) The Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit all sale proceeds into an 
interest-bearing account unless prohibited by the laws or customs of the 
importing country or CCC determines that to do so would constitute an 
undue burden. Interest earned on such deposits shall only be used for 
approved activities.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the Cooperating 
Sponsor may use sale proceeds and resulting interest only for those 
purposes approved in the applicable Plan of Operation.
    (e) CCC will approve the use of sale proceeds and interest to 
purchase real and personal property where local law permits the 
Cooperating Sponsor to retain title to such property, but will not 
approve the use of sale proceeds or interest to pay for the acquisition, 
development, construction, alteration or upgrade of real property that 
is;
    (1) Owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged 
exclusively in religious activity, or
    (2) Used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes; except that, a 
Cooperating Sponsor may use such sale proceeds or interest to pay for 
repairs or rehabilitation of a structure located on such real property 
to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of provided 
commodities but only if such structure is not used in whole or in part 
for any religious or sectarian purposes while the provided commodities 
are stored in such structure. When not approved in the Plan of 
Operation, such use may be approved by the Agricultural Counsellor or 
Attache.
    (f) The Cooperating Sponsor shall follow commercially reasonable 
practices in procuring goods and services and when engaging in 
construction activity in accordance with the approved Plan of Operation. 
Such practices shall include procedures to prevent fraud, self-dealing 
and conflicts of interest, and shall foster free and open competition to 
the maximum extent practicable.
    (g) To the extent required by the Program Agreement, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall submit to the Controller, CCC, and to the Director, PDD, 
an inventory of all assets acquired with sale proceeds or interest or 
program income. In the event that its participation in the program 
terminates, the Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose, at the direction of 
the Director, PDD, of any property, real or personal, so acquired.

Sec. 1499.13  Processing, packaging and labeling of section 416(b) 
commodities in the foreign country.

    (a) Cooperating Sponsors may arrange for the processing of 
commodities provided under a section 416(b) Program Agreement, or for 
packaging or repackaging prior to distribution. When a third party 
provides such processing, packaging or repackaging, the

[[Page 861]]

Cooperating Sponsor shall enter into a written agreement requiring that 
the provider of such services maintain adequate records to account for 
all commodities delivered and submit periodic reports to the Cooperating 
Sponsor. The Cooperating Sponsor shall submit a copy of the executed 
agreement to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache.
    (b) If, prior to distribution, the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for 
packaging or repackaging commodities provided under section 416(b), the 
packaging shall be plainly labeled in the language of the country in 
which the commodities are to be distributed with the name of the 
commodity and, except where the commodities are to be sold or bartered 
after processing, packaging or repackaging, to indicate that the 
commodity is furnished by the people of the United States of America and 
not to be sold or exchanged. If the commodities are not packaged, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall, to the extent practicable, display banners, 
posters or other media containing the information prescribed in this 
paragraph.
    (c) CCC will reimburse Cooperating Sponsors that are nonprofit 
private voluntary organizations or cooperatives for expenses incurred 
for repackaging if the packages of commodities provided under section 
416(b) are discharged from the vessel in damaged condition, and are 
repackaged to ensure that the commodities arrive at the distribution 
point in wholesome condition. No prior approval is required for such 
expenses equaling $500 or less. If such expense is estimated to exceed 
$500, the authority to repackage and incur such expense must be approved 
by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache in advance of repackaging.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.14  Disposition of commodities unfit for authorized use.

    (a) Prior to delivery to Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or 
point of entry. If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a 
governmental Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or point of entry 
overseas, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache will immediately arrange 
for inspection by a public health official or other competent authority. 
If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a nongovernmental 
Cooperating Sponsor at the discharge port or point of entry, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for such inspection. 
If inspection discloses the commodity to be unfit for the use authorized 
in the Program Agreement, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose of the commodities in 
accordance with the priority set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Expenses incidental to the handling and disposition of the damaged 
commodity will be paid by CCC from the sale proceeds or from an 
appropriate CCC account designated by CCC. The net proceeds of sales 
shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, 
for the credit of CCC in an appropriate CCC account designated by CCC; 
however, if the commodities are provided for a sales program, the net 
sale proceeds, net of expenses incidental to handling and disposition of 
the damaged commodity, shall be deposited to the special account 
established for sale proceeds. The Cooperating Sponsor shall consult 
with CCC regarding the inspection and disposition of commodities and 
accounting for sale proceeds in the event the Cooperating Sponsor 
executed a sales agreement under which title passed to the purchaser 
prior to delivery to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (b) After delivery to Cooperating Sponsor. (1) If after arrival in a 
foreign country and after delivery to a Cooperating Sponsor, it appears 
that the commodity, or any part thereof, may be unfit for the use 
authorized in the Program Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall 
immediately arrange for inspection of the commodity by a public health 
official or other competent authority approved by the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache. If no competent local authority is available, the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache may determine whether the commodities 
are unfit for the use authorized in the Program Agreement and, if so, 
may direct disposal in accordance with this paragraph (b) of this 
section. The Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for the recovery of that 
portion of the commodities designated during the inspection as suitable 
for authorized use. If, upon

[[Page 862]]

inspection, the commodity (or any part thereof) is determined to be 
unfit for the authorized use, the Cooperating Sponsor shall notify the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache of the circumstances pertaining to the 
loss or damage. With the concurrence of the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache, the commodity determined to be unfit for authorized use shall 
be disposed of in the following order of priority:
    (i) By transfer to an approved section 416(b) program for use as 
livestock feed. CCC shall be advised promptly of any such transfer so 
that shipments from the United States to the livestock feeding program 
can be reduced by an equivalent amount;
    (ii) Sale for the most appropriate use, i.e., animal feed, 
fertilizer, or industrial use, at the highest obtainable price. When the 
commodity is sold, all U.S. Government markings shall be obliterated or 
removed;
    (iii) By donation to a governmental or charitable organization for 
use as animal feed or for other non-food use; or
    (iv) If the commodity is unfit for any use or if disposal in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section is 
not possible, the commodity shall be destroyed under the observation of 
a representative of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, if 
practicable, in such manner as to prevent its use for any purpose.
    (2) Actual expenses incurred, including third party costs, in 
effecting any sale may be deducted from the sale proceeds and, if the 
commodities were intended for direct distribution, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall deposit the net proceeds with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, 
American Embassy, with instructions to credit the deposit to an 
appropriate CCC account as designated by CCC. If the commodities were 
intended to be sold, the Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit the gross 
proceeds into the special interest bearing account and, after approved 
costs related to the handling and disposition of damaged commodities are 
paid, shall use the remaining funds for purposes of the approved 
program. The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache a written report of all circumstances 
relating to the loss and damage on any commodity loss in excess of 
$5,000; quarterly reports shall be made on all other losses. If the 
commodity was inspected by a public health official or other competent 
authority, the report and any supplemental report shall include a 
certification by such public health official or other competent 
authority as to the condition of the commodity and the exact quantity of 
the damaged commodity disposed. Such certification shall be obtained as 
soon as possible after the discharge of the cargo. A report must also be 
provided to the Chief, Debt Management Division, KCMO/DMD, of action 
taken to dispose of commodities unfit for authorized use.

[61 FR 60515, Nov. 29, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 59877, Nov. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1499.15  Liability for loss, damage, or improper distribution 
of commodities--claims and procedures.

    (a) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor prior to loading on ocean vessel. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify KCCO, Chief, Export 
Operations Division if the Cooperating Sponsor will not have a vessel 
for loading at the U.S. port of export in accordance with the agreed 
shipping schedule. CCC will determine whether the commodity will be: 
moved to another available outlet; stored at the port for delivery to 
the Cooperating Sponsor when a vessel is available for loading; or 
disposed of as CCC may deem proper. The Cooperating Sponsor shall take 
such action as directed by CCC and shall reimburse CCC for expenses 
incurred if CCC determines that the expenses were incurred because of 
the fault or negligence of the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (b) Fault of others prior to loading on ocean vessel. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify the Chief, Debt Management 
Office, KCMO/DMD, when any damage or loss to the commodity occurs that 
is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier, or other person between the 
time title is transferred to a Cooperating Sponsor and the time the 
commodity is loaded on board vessel at the designated port of export. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly assign to CCC any rights to 
claims which may arise as a result of such loss

[[Page 863]]

or damage and shall promptly forward to CCC all documents pertaining 
thereto. CCC shall have the right to initiate claims, and retain the 
proceeds of all claims, for such loss or damage.
    (c) Survey and outturn reports related to claims against ocean 
carriers. (1) If the Program Agreement provides that CCC will arrange 
for an independent cargo surveyor to attend the discharge of the cargo, 
CCC will require the surveyor to provide a copy of the report to the 
Cooperating Sponsor.
    (2)(i) If the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for an independent cargo 
surveyor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall forward to the Chief, Debt 
Management Office, KCMO/DMD, any narrative chronology or other 
commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean 
transportation claims and shall prepare such a narrative in any case 
where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00. The 
Cooperating Sponsor may, at its option, also engage the independent 
surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs 
or port areas to the Cooperating Sponsor or its agent and to issue 
delivery survey reports thereon.
    (ii) In the event of cargo loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall provide to the Chief, Debt Management Office, KCMO/DMD, the names 
and addresses of individuals who were present at the time of discharge 
and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. For 
bulk grain shipments, in those cases where the Cooperating Sponsor is 
responsible for survey and outturn reports, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to:
    (A) Observe the discharge of the cargo;
    (B) Report on discharging methods including scale type, calibrations 
and any other factor which may affect the accuracy of scale weights, 
and, if scales are not used, state the reason therefore and describe the 
actual method used to determine weights;
    (C) Estimate the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge 
through carrier negligence;
    (D) Advise on the quality of sweepings;
    (E) Obtain copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing 
quantity discharged;
    (F) Provide immediate notification to the Cooperating Sponsor if 
additional services are necessary to protect cargo interests or if the 
surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not 
discharged; and
    (G) In the case of shipments arriving in container vans, list the 
container van numbers and seal numbers shown on the container vans, and 
indicate whether the seals were intact at the time the container vans 
were opened, and whether the container vans were in any way damaged. To 
the extent possible, the independent surveyor should observe discharge 
of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the 
container van occurred and arrange for surveying as container vans are 
opened.
    (iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCMO/DMD, Chief, 
Debt Management Office of all reports and documents pertaining to the 
discharge of commodities.
    (iv) CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for costs incurred 
upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other 
documents that establish the survey cost. CCC will not reimburse a 
Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of a delivery survey unless the 
surveyor also prepares a discharge survey, or for any other survey not 
taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless CCC 
determines that such action was justified in the circumstances.
    (3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless 
CCC determines that the use of competitive bids would not be 
practicable. CCC may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of 
conflicts of interest or lack of demonstrated capability to properly 
carry out surveying responsibilities.
    (4) If practicable, all surveys shall be conducted jointly by the 
surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report 
shall be signed by all parties.
    (d) Ocean carrier loss and damage. (1) Notwithstanding transfer of 
title, CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and retain the proceeds 
of collection from

[[Page 864]]

claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss and damage arising 
out of shipments of commodities provided to governmental Cooperating 
Sponsors; however, when the Cooperating Sponsor pays the ocean freight 
or a portion thereof, it shall be entitled to pro rata reimbursement 
received from any claims related to ocean freight charged. CCC will pay 
general average contributions for all valid general average incidents 
which may arise from the movement of commodity to the destination ports. 
CCC shall receive and retain all allowances in general average.
    (2) Nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors shall: file notice with the 
ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any cargo loss or damage; 
promptly initiate claims against the ocean carriers for such loss and 
damage; take all necessary action to obtain restitution for losses, and 
(iv) provide CCC copies of all such claims. Notwithstanding the 
preceding sentence the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor need not file 
a claim when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the 
loss is between $100 and $300 and the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor determines that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will 
exceed the amount of the claim. The nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor 
shall transmit to KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt Management Office information 
and documentation on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to 
be filed. In the event of a declaration General Average:
    (i) The Cooperating Sponsor shall assign all claim rights to CCC and 
shall provide CCC all documentation relating to the claim, if 
applicable;
    (ii) CCC will be responsible for settling general average and marine 
salvage claims;
    (iii) CCC has sole authority to authorize any disposition of 
commodities which have not commenced ocean transit or of which the ocean 
transit is interrupted;
    (iv) CCC will receive and retain any monetary proceeds resulting 
from such disposition;
    (v) CCC will initiate, prosecute, and retain all proceeds of cargo 
loss and damage against ocean carriers and any allowance in general 
average; and
    (vi) CCC will pay any general average or marine salvage claims 
determined to be due.
    (3) Amounts collected by nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors on 
claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained 
by the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor. On claims involving loss or 
damage of $200 or more, nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors may retain 
from collections received by them, either $200 plus 10 percent of the 
difference between $200 and the total amount collected on the claim, up 
to a maximum of $500; or the actual administrative expenses incurred in 
collection of the claim, provided retention of such administrative 
expenses is approved by CCC. Allowable collection costs shall not 
include attorneys fees, fees of collection agencies, and similar costs. 
In no event will CCC pay collection costs in excess of the amount 
collected on the claim.
    (4) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor also may retain from claim 
recoveries remaining after allowable deductions for administrative 
expenses of collection, the amount of any special charges, such as 
handling and packing costs, which the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor has incurred on the lost or damaged commodity and which are 
included in the claims and paid by the liable party.
    (5) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may redetermine claims on 
the basis of additional documentation or information not considered when 
the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information 
clearly changes the ocean carrier's liability. Approval of such changes 
by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of 
redetermined claims and supporting documentation or information shall be 
furnished to CCC.
    (6) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may negotiate compromise 
settlements of claims of any amount, provided that proposed compromise 
settlements of claims having a value of $5,000 or more shall require 
prior approval in writing by CCC. When a claim is compromised, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may retain from

[[Page 865]]

the amount collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the 
special charges described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section as 
compromised amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is 
less than $600, a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may terminate 
collection activity when it is determined that pursuit of such claims 
will not be economically sound. Approval for such termination by CCC is 
not required; however, the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall 
notify KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt Management Division when collection 
activity on a claim is terminated.
    (7) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized in 
this section to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the purpose of 
determining the amount to be retained by a nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against ocean carriers, the 
word ``claim'' shall refer to the loss and damage to commodities which 
are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port 
destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the 
number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier.
    (8) If a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor is unable to effect 
collection of a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement 
within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof 
granted in writing by the party alleged responsible for the damage, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall assign its rights to the claim 
to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of legal action prior to 
the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. 
Generally, a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor should assign claim 
rights to CCC no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the 
period of limitation or any extension thereof. In all cases, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall keep CCC informed of the 
progress of its collection efforts and shall promptly assign their claim 
rights to CCC upon request. Subsequently, if CCC collects on or settles 
the claim, CCC shall, except as indicated in this paragraph pay to a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor the amount to which it would have 
been entitled had it collected on the claim. The additional 10 percent 
on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable, however, only if 
CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim 
prior to the assignment, or if payment is determined to be commensurate 
with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting the claim. If 
documentation requirements have not been fulfilled and the lack of such 
documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction of CCC, CCC 
will deny payment of all allowances to the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor.
    (9) When a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor permits a claim to 
become time-barred, or fails to take timely actions to insure the right 
of CCC to assert such claims, and CCC determines that the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor failed to properly exercise its 
responsibilities under the Agreement, the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor shall be liable to the United States for the cost and freight 
value of the commodities lost to the program.
    (e) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor in country of distribution. If a 
commodity, sale proceeds or program income is used for a purpose not 
permitted by the Program Agreement, or if a Cooperating Sponsor causes 
loss or damage to a commodity, sale proceeds, or program income through 
any act or omission or failure to provide proper storage, care and 
handling, the cooperating sponsor shall pay to the United States the 
value of the commodities, sale proceeds or program income lost, damaged 
or misused. CCC will consider normal commercial practices in the country 
of distribution in determining whether there was a proper exercise of 
the Cooperating Sponsor's responsibility. Payment by the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Fault of others in country of distribution and in intermediate 
country. (1) In addition to survey or outturn reports to determine ocean 
carrier loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor

[[Page 866]]

shall, in the case of landlocked countries, arrange for an independent 
survey at the point of entry into the recipient country and make a 
report as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will 
reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of survey as set forth 
in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (2) Where any damage to or loss of the commodity or any loss of sale 
proceeds or program income is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier or 
other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort 
to pursue collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file 
or pursue such claims shall be liable to CCC for the value of the 
commodities or sale proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or 
misused: Provided, however, that the Cooperating Sponsor may elect not 
to file a claim if the loss is less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In 
addition, Cooperating Sponsors may, with the written approval of the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache, retain amounts to cover special costs 
of collection such as legal fees, or pay such collection costs with sale 
proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than the 
full amount of the claim requires prior approval by the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache. When the Cooperating Sponsor has exhausted all 
reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache to provide further instructions.
    (3) The Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial 
billings and at least three subsequent demands at not more than 30 day 
intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue legal action in the judicial system of 
country unless otherwise agreed by the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache. The Cooperating Sponsors must inform the Agricultural Counselor 
or Attache in writing of the reasons for not pursuing legal action; and 
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require the Cooperating 
Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its 
decision prior to granting approval. If the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further 
action on the claim, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the claim to 
CCC and shall forward all documentation relating to the claim to KCMO/
DMD.
    (4) As an alternative to legal action in the judicial system of the 
country with regard to claims against a public entity of the government 
of the cooperating country, the Cooperating Sponsor and the cooperating 
country may agree in writing to settle disputed claims by an appropriate 
administrative procedure or arbitration.
    (g) Determination of value. The Cooperating Sponsor shall determine 
the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged on the basis of the 
domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage 
occurred. When it is not feasible to determine such market price, the 
value shall be the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the 
commodity at the time and place of export, plus ocean freight charges 
and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to 
the Cooperating Sponsor. When the value is determined on a cost basis, 
the Cooperating Sponsor may add to the value any provable costs it has 
incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim 
statement, these costs shall be clearly segregated from costs incurred 
by the Government of the United States. With respect to claims other 
than ocean carrier loss or damage claims, the Cooperating Sponsor may 
request the Agricultural Counselor or Attache to approve a commercially 
reasonable alternative basis to value the claim.
    (h) Reporting losses to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC 
designated representative. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly 
notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated 
representative, in writing, of the circumstances pertaining to any loss, 
damage, or misuse of commodities valued at $500 or more occurring within 
the country of distribution or intermediate country. The report shall be

[[Page 867]]

made as soon as the Cooperating Sponsor has adequately investigated the 
circumstances, but in no event more than ninety days from the date the 
loss became known to the Cooperating Sponsor. The report shall identify 
the party in possession of the commodities and the party responsible for 
the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantities of commodities; the 
size and type of containers; the time and place of misuse, loss, or 
damage; the current location of the commodity; the Program Agreement 
number, the CCC contract numbers, or if unknown, other identifying 
numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action taken by the 
Cooperating Sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the 
estimated value of the commodity. The report shall explain why any of 
the information required by this paragraph cannot be provided. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall also report the details regarding any loss or 
misuse of sale proceeds or program income.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall report quarterly to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache any loss, damage to or misuse of 
commodities resulting in loss of less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
shall inform the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated 
representative if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend 
in the loss, damage, or misuse of such commodities and submit a report 
as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, together with any 
other relevant information the Cooperating Sponsor has available to it. 
The Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require additional information 
about any commodities lost, damaged or misused.
    (i) Handling claims proceeds. Claims against ocean carriers shall be 
collected in U.S. dollars (or in the currency in which freight is paid) 
and shall be remitted (less amounts authorized to be retained) by 
Cooperating Sponsors to CCC. Claims against Cooperating Sponsors shall 
be paid to CCC in U.S. dollars. With respect to commodities lost, 
damaged or misused, amounts paid by Cooperating Sponsors and third 
parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the U.S. 
Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably in U.S. dollars with 
instructions to credit the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as 
determined by CCC, or in local currency at the highest rate of exchange 
legally obtainable on the date of deposit with instructions to credit 
the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC. With 
respect to sale proceeds and program income, amounts recovered may be 
deposited in the same account as the sale proceeds and may be used for 
purposes of the program.

Sec. 1499.16  Records and reporting requirements.

    (a) Records and reports--general requirements. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall maintain records for a period of three (3) years from the 
date of export of the commodities that accurately reflect the receipt 
and use of the commodities and any proceeds realized from the sale of 
commodities. The Government of the Exporting Country may, at reasonable 
times, inspect the Cooperating Sponsor's records pertaining to the 
receipt and use of the commodities and proceeds realized from the sale 
of the commodities, and have access to the Cooperating Sponsor's 
commodity storage and distribution sites and to locations of activities 
supported with proceeds realized from the sale of the commodities.
    (b) Evidence of export. The Cooperating Sponsor's freight forwarder 
shall, within thirty (30) days after export, submit evidence of export 
of the agricultural commodities to the Chief, Export Operations 
Division, KCCO. If export is by sea or air, the Cooperating Sponsor's 
freight forwarder shall submit five copies of the carrier's on board 
bill of lading or consignee's receipt authenticated by a representative

and quantity of agricultural commodities exported, the date of export, 
and the destination country.
    (c) Reports. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall submit a semiannual 
logistics report to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache and to the 
Director, CCC Program Support Division, FAS/USDA, Washington, DC 20250-
1031, covering

[[Page 868]]

the receipt of commodities. Cooperating sponsors must submit reports on 
Form CCC-620 and submit the first report by May 16 for agreements signed 
during the period, October 1 through March 31, or by November 16 for 
agreements signed during the period, April 1 through September 30. The 
first report must cover the time period from the date of signing and 
subsequent reports must be provided at six months intervals covering the 
period from the due date of the last report until all commodities have 
been distributed or sold and such distribution or sale reported to CCC. 
The report must contain the following data:
    (i) Receipts of agricultural commodities including the name of each 
vessel, discharge port(s) or point(s) of entry, the date discharge was 
completed, the condition of the commodities on arrival, any significant 
loss or damage in transit; advice of any claim for, or recovery of, or 
reduction of freight charges due to loss or damage in transit on U.S. 
flag vessels;
    (ii) Estimated commodity inventory at the end of the reporting 
period;
    (iii) Quantity of commodity on order during the reporting period;
    (iv) Status of claims for commodity losses both resolved and 
unresolved during the reporting period;
    (v) Quantity of commodity damaged or declared unfit during the 
reporting period; and
    (vi) Quantity and type of the commodity that has been directly 
distributed by the Cooperating Sponsor, distribution date, region of 
distribution, and estimated number of individuals benefiting from the 
distribution.
    (2) If the Program Agreement authorizes the sale or barter of 
commodities by the Cooperating Sponsor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall 
also submit a semiannual monetization report to the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache and to the Director, CCC Program Support Division, 
FAS/USDA, Washington, DC 20250-1031, a monetization report covering the 
deposits into and disbursements from the special account for the 
purposes specified in the Program Agreement. Cooperating Sponsors must 
submit reports on Form CCC-621 and submit the first report by May 16 for 
agreements signed during the period, October 1 through March 31, or by 
November 16 for agreements signed during the period, April 1 through 
September 30. The first report must cover the time period from the date 
of signing and subsequent reports must be provided at six months 
intervals covering the period from the due date of the last report until 
all funds generated from commodity sales have been distributed and such 
distribution reported to CCC. The report must contain the following 
information and include both local currency amounts and U.S. dollar

    Nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors shall assure that audits are 
performed to assure compliance with Program Agreements and the 
provisions of this part. An audit undertaken in accordance with OMB 
Circular A-133, shall fulfill the audit requirements of this section. 
Audits shall be performed at least annually until all commodities have 
been distributed and sale proceeds expended. Both the auditor and the 
auditing standards to be used by the Cooperating Sponsor must be 
acceptable to CCC. The Cooperating Sponsor is also responsible for 
auditing the activities of recipient agencies that receive more than 
$25,000 of provided commodities or sale proceeds. This responsibility 
may be satisfied by relying upon independent audits of the recipient 
agency or upon a review conducted by the Cooperating Sponsor.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.18  Suspension of the program.

    All or any part of the assistance provided under a Program 
Agreement, including commodities in transit, may be suspended by CCC if:
    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor fails to comply with the provisions of 
the Program Agreement or this part;
    (b) CCC determines that the continuation of such assistance is no 
longer necessary or desirable; or
    (c) CCC determines that storage facilities are inadequate to prevent 
spoilage or waste, or that distribution of commodities will result in 
substantial disincentive to, or interference with, domestic production 
or marketing in the recipient country.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.19  Sample documents and guidelines for developing proposals 
and reports.

    CCC has developed guidelines to assist the Cooperating Sponsors in

polarity on a dry weight basis.
    (1) To adjust the raw value for sugar with a polarization of less 
than 92 degrees, divide the total sugar content by 0.972 (polarization x 
outturn weight/.972).
    (2) To adjust the raw value for sugar with polarization of 92 
degrees or above, multiply the polarization times 0.0175, subtract 0.68, 
and multiply the difference by the outturn weight (((polarization x 
0.0175)-0.68) x outturn weight).
    (3) To determine the quantity of refined sugar that must be 
transferred or exported to equal a corresponding quantity of entered raw 
sugar charged to a license, divide the quantity of entered raw sugar by 
1.07 (raw quantity/1.07).

Sec. 1530.107  Bond or letter of credit requirements

    (a) The licensee may charge program sugar in anticipation of the 
transfer or export of refined sugar, the export of sugar in sugar 
containing products, or the production of certain polyhydric alcohols, 
if the licensee establishes a performance bond or a letter of credit 
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which meets the criteria set 
forth in this section.
    (b) The bond or letter of credit may cover entries made either 
during the period of time specified in the bond (a term bond) or for a 
specified entry (a single entry bond).
    (c) Only the licensee who will refine the sugar, manufacture the 
sugar containing product, or produce certain polyhydric alcohols may be 
the principal on the bond or letter of credit covering such sugar to be 
re-exported or used in the production of certain polyhydric alcohols. 
The surety or sureties shall be among those listed by the Secretary of 
the Treasury as acceptable on Federal bonds.
    (d) The obligation under the bond or letter of credit shall be made 
effective no later than the date of entry of the

[[Page 878]]

sugar for refiners or the date of transfer of the corresponding sugar 
for manufacture into a sugar containing product or certain polyhydric 
alcohols.
    (e) The amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be equal to 20 
cents per pound of sugar to be entered under the license.
    (f) If a licensee fails to qualify for credit to a license within 
the specified time period of the date of export or use of corresponding 
sugar in an amount sufficient to offset the charge to the license for 
that corresponding sugar, payment shall be made to the U.S. Treasury. 
The payment shall be equal to the difference between the Number 11 
contract price and the Number 14 contract price (New York Coffee, Sugar 
and Cocoa Exchange) in effect on the last market day before the date of 
entry of the sugar or the last market day before the end of the period 
during which export or use was required, whichever difference is 
greater. The difference shall be multiplied by the quantity of refined 
sugar, converted to raw value, that should have been exported in 
compliance with this part. If there was not a Number 11, or a Number 14 
contract price for the relevant market day, the Licensing Authority may 
estimate such price as he or she deems appropriate.

    Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5663.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.10  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program (SOAP) and Cottonseed Oil 
Assistance Program (COAP) administered by the Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered 
together in order to select eligible countries for SOAP and COAP 
initiatives which will best meet the programs' objective. The objective 
of the programs is to encourage the sale of additional quantities of 
sunflowerseed oil and cottonseed oil in world markets at competitive 
prices. Under the SOAP and the COAP, bonuses are made available by FAS 
to enable exporters to meet prevailing world prices for sunflowerseed 
oil and cottonseed oil in targeted destinations. In the operation of the 
SOAP and the COAP, FAS will make reasonable efforts to avoid the 
displacement of usual marketings of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.20  Criteria.

    The criteria considered by FAS in reviewing proposals for SOAP and 
COAP initiatives will include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) The expected contribution which initiatives will make toward 
realizing U.S. agricultural export goals and, in particular, in 
developing, expanding, or maintaining markets for U.S. sunflowerseed 
and/or cottonseed oil;
    (b) The subsidy requirements of proposed initiatives in relation to 
the sums made available to operate the programs in any given fiscal 
year; and
    (c) The likelihood that sales facilitated by initiatives would have 
the unintended effect of displacing normal commercial sales of 
sunflowerseed and/or cottonseed oil.

    Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5676.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.1100  Drawback certification.

    An offer submitted by an exporter to FAS for an export bonus under 
the SOAP or the COAP must contain, in addition to any other information 
required by FAS, a certification stating the following: ``None of the 
eligible commodity (sunflowerseed oil and/or cottonseed oil) has been or 
will be used as the basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant 
to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1313) of any duty, 
tax, or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or 
product.'' This certification must be signed by the exporter, if the 
exporter is an individual, or by a partner or officer of the exporter, 
if the exporter is a partnership or a corporation, respectively. FAS 
will reject any offer that does not contain the prescribed 
certification.

<R05>
Sec. 1599.4  How do I apply?

    To apply for this program, a Cooperating Sponsor shall submit an SF-
424, which is a standard application for federal assistance, a Program 
Introduction, a Plan of Operation, and a Budget Proposal to the 
Director, PPDED and to the Agricultural Counselor or Attach[eacute] 
responsible for the country where activities are to be implemented. 
Electronic submissions of these items are preferred, particularly 
through the FAS on-line system. If on-line submission is not available, 
e-mail or hard copy are acceptable.
    (a) SF-424
    (b) Program Introduction shall include the following:
    (1) Information about the organization's past food aid activities 
with particular emphasis on school feeding, maternal child health or 
other relevant development activities, its experience within the country 
where the program is proposed, and any other relevant information to 
demonstrate its capability to implement the program in the country, with 
particular emphasis on the organizations ability to:
    (i) Identify and assess the needs of beneficiaries, especially 
malnourished or undernourished mothers and their children who are 5 
years of age or younger, and school-age children who are malnourished, 
undernourished, or do not regularly attend school;
    (ii) In the case of preschool and school-age children, target low-
income areas where child enrollment and attendance in school is low or 
girls enrollment and participation in preschool or school is low;
    (iii) Incorporate developmental objectives for improving literacy 
and primary education (especially with girls); and,
    (iv) In the case of maternal and child nutrition activities, 
coordinate supplementary feeding and nutrition programs with existing or 
newly established maternal, infant, and child programs that meet 
maternal, prenatal, postnatal, and newborns health needs;
    (2) Reasons for the need for the food aid and in particular, a 
school feeding program in the country. The organization shall include 
statistics on poverty, food deficits, and related items such as:
    (i) Literacy rates for the target population;

information; and lastly,
    (vii) Other potential donors;
    (3) Verification that the national government is committed to or is 
working toward, through a national action plan, the goals of the World 
Declaration on Education for All convened in 1990 in Jomtien, Thailand,

Forum, convened in 2000;
    (4) Steps to graduate the program from food aid and address 
sustainability, or sustainable program components, which will continue 
after the end of food aid donations. In addressing graduation or 
sustainability,

education, enrollment, and attendance of children in schools in the 
targeted communities when the provision of commodities and assistance to 
a recipient country under FFE terminates;
    (ii) Estimate the time required until the recipient country or 
eligible organizations will be able to provide sufficient assistance 
without additional assistance under FFE; or in the absence of 
sustainability; and

Sec. 1599.6(b)(4)(i) would enhance the effectiveness of the activities 
implemented under this subpart. For purposes of this section, 
``expenditures that would enhance the effectiveness of the activities 
implemented under this subpart'' are those expenditures which would 
increase the likelihood of meeting the objectives of the activities as 
stated in the Plan of Operation. Examples of costs that may enhance the 
effectiveness of a school feeding program may be the purchase of 
utensils and food trays, text books, and incentives for teachers, as 
well as the use of consultancies to provide technical assistance in the 
educational improvement area when conducting teacher training. These 
costs may include a limited amount to procure locally produced foods.
    (7) If your proposal includes monetization or barter, demonstrate 
that monetization or bartering of commodities offers more benefits than 
a direct cash outlay.
    (c) A Plan of Operation shall provide the following information:

identification of the administrative or technical personnel who will 
implement the activities;
    (iv) Activity budgets, including costs that will be borne by the 
Cooperating Sponsor, other organizations or local governments. If a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor requests FAS to fund costs 
identified in Sec. 1599.6(b)(4)(i), the Cooperating Sponsor shall 
include a detailed description of:

recipient country. The Cooperating Sponsor shall also include a 
description of the steps that the government of the host country is 
taking to improve the preschool and school systems in the country;
    (vii) Method of educating consumers as to the source of the provided 
commodities and, where appropriate, preparation and use of the

from the barter of the agricultural commodities provided, or the amount 
of program income expected to be generated;
    (iv) The steps taken to use, to the extent possible, the private 
sector in the process of selling commodities;
    (v) The specific uses of sale proceeds or program income and a 
timetable for their expenditure; and
    (vi) Procedures for assuring the receipt and deposit of sale 
proceeds and program income into a separate special account and 
procedures for the disbursement of the proceeds and program income from 
such special account.
    (6) Distribution methods: (i) A description of the transportation 
and storage system which will be used to move the agricultural

be developed. The Program Agreement, which will incorporate the terms 
and conditions set forth in this part, the commodities provided by FAS, 
and any packaging, will meet the specifications set forth in such 
Program Agreement. A Program Agreement may contain special terms or 
conditions, in addition to or in lieu of, the terms and conditions set 
forth in the regulations in this part when FAS determines that such 
special terms or conditions are necessary to effectively carry out the 
particular Program Agreement. The Plan of Operation, Budget Proposal, 
and Commodity specifications will be incorporated into the Program 
Agreement as Attachments.

end of each calendar quarter, submit a financial statement to the 
Director, PPDED, accounting for all funds advanced and all interest 
earned.
    (j) FAS will pay all other costs for which it is obligated under the 
Program Agreement by reimbursement. However, FAS will not pay any cost 
incurred after the final date specified in the Program Agreement.

Sec. 1599.7  What procedures apply to procuring ocean transportation?

    (a) Cargo preference. Shipments of commodities are subject to the 
requirements of sections 901(b) and 901b of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, regarding carriage on U.S.-flag vessels. A Cooperating Sponsor 
shall comply with the instructions of FAS regarding the quantity of 
commodities that must be carried on U.S. flag vessels.
    (b) Freight procurement requirements. When FAS is financing any 
portion of the ocean freight, whether on U.S. flag or non-U.S. flag 
vessels, and the Cooperating Sponsor arranges ocean transportation:
    (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange ocean transportation 
through competitive bidding and shall obtain approval of all invitations 
for bids from the Director, CCC-OD.
    (2) Invitations for bids shall be posted on FAS' Web site and a 
commercially available news wire service.
    (3) Freight invitations for bids shall include specified procedures 
for payment of freight, including the party responsible for the freight 
payments, and expressly require that:
    (i) Offers include a contract canceling date no later than the last 
contract layday specified in the invitation for bids;
    (ii) Offered rates be quoted in U.S. dollars per metric ton;
    (iii) If destination bagging or transportation to a point beyond the 
discharge port is required, the offer separately state the total rate 
and the portion thereof attributable to the ocean segment of the 
movement;
    (iv) Any non-liner U.S. flag vessel 15 years or older offer, in 
addition to any other offered rate, a one-way rate applicable in the 
event the vessel is scrapped or transferred to foreign flag registry 
prior to the end of the return voyage to the United States;
    (v) In the case of packaged commodities, U.S. flag carriers specify 
whether delivery will be direct breakbulk shipment, container shipment, 
or breakbulk transshipment and identify whether transshipment (including 
container relays) will be via U.S. or foreign flag vessel;
    (vi) Vessels offered subject to Maritime Administration approval 
will not be accepted; and
    (vii) Offers be received by a specified closing time, which must be 
the same for both U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels.
    (4) In the case of shipments of bulk commodities and non-liner 
shipments of packaged commodities, the Cooperating Sponsor shall open 
offers in public in the United States at the time and place specified in 
the invitation for bids and consider only offers that are responsive to 
the invitation for bids without negotiation. Late offers shall not be 
considered or accepted.
    (5) All responsive offers received for both U.S. flag and foreign 
flag service shall be presented to KCCO which will determine the extent 
to which U.S.-flag vessels will be used.
    (6) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish the Director, 
CCC-OD, or other official specified in the Program Agreement, copies of 
all offers received with the time of receipt indicated thereon. The 
Director, CCC-OD, or other official specified in the Program Agreement, 
will approve all

[[Page 901]]

vessel fixtures. The Cooperating Sponsor may fix vessels subject to the 
required approval; however, the Cooperating Sponsor shall not confirm a 
vessel fixture until advised of the required approval and the results of 
the Maritime Administration's guideline rate review. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall not request guideline rate advice from the Maritime 
Administration.
    (7) Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers may not be employed to 
carry shipments on either U.S. or foreign-flag vessels.
    (8) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish the Director CCC-
OD, a copy of the signed laytime statement and statement of facts at the 
discharge port.
    (c) Shipping agents. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor may appoint a 
shipping agent to assist in the procurement of ocean transportation. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall nominate the shipping agent in writing to the 
Deputy Administrator, Room 4077-S, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1031, and include a copy 
of the proposed agency agreement. The Cooperating Sponsor shall specify 
the time period of the nomination.
    (2) The shipping agent so nominated shall submit the information and 
certifications required by 7 CFR 17.4 to the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) A person may not act as a shipping agent for a Cooperating 
Sponsor unless the Deputy Administrator has notified the Cooperating 
Sponsor in writing that the nomination is accepted.
    (d) Commissions. (1) When any portion of the ocean freight is paid 
by FAS, total commissions earned on U.S. and foreign flag bookings by 
all parties arranging vessel fixtures, shall not exceed 2\1/2\ percent 
of the total freight costs.
    (2) Address commissions are prohibited.
    (e) Contract terms. When FAS is paying any portion of the ocean 
freight, charter parties and liner booking contracts must conform to the 
following requirements, as applicable:
    (1) Packaged commodities on liner vessels shall be shipped on the 
basis of full berth terms with no demurrage or despatch;
    (2) Shipments of bulk liquid commodities may be contracted in 
accordance with trade custom. Other bulk commodities, including 
shipments that require bagging or stacking for the account of the 
vessel, shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load, free out, with 
demurrage and despatch applicable at load and discharge ports; except 
that, if bulk commodities require further inland distribution, they 
shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load with demurrage and despatch 
at load and berth terms discharge, i.e., no demurrage, despatch, or 
detention at discharge. Demurrage and despatch shall be settled between 
the ocean carrier and commodity suppliers at load port and between the 
ocean carrier and charterers at discharge ports. FAS is not responsible 
for resolving disputes involving the calculation of laytime or the 
payment of demurrage or despatch.
    (3) If the Program Agreement requires the Cooperating Sponsor to 
arrange an irrevocable letter of credit for ocean freight, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable for detention of the vessel for 
loading delays attributable solely to the decision of the ocean carrier 
not to commence loading because of the failure of the Cooperating 
Sponsor to establish such letter of credit. Charter parties and liner 
booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean 
carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention for 
all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, 
including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay 
shall not commence earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the 
designated loading port within the laydays specified in the charter 
party or liner booking contract, and upon notification of the vessel's 
readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the applicable charter 
party or liner booking contract. The period of such delay shall end at 
the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit have been 
established for ocean freight or the time the vessel begins loading, 
whichever is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not count as

[[Page 902]]

laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no later than 
upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.
    (4) Charges including, but not limited to charges for inspection, 
fumigation, and carrying charges, attributable to the failure of the 
vessel to present before the canceling date will be for the account of 
the ocean carrier.
    (5) 100% of ocean freight is earned and payable under a charter 
party when the vessel and cargo arrive at the first port of discharge, 
Provided, That if a force majeure prevents the vessel's arrival at the 
first port of discharge, 100% of the ocean freight is payable, and 
provided further, that if the charter party provides for completing 
additional requirements after discharge such as bagging, stacking, or 
inland transportation, not more than 85% of the ocean freight is earned 
and payable at the time the Associate Administrator determines that such 
force majeure was the cause of nonarrival; and
    (6) When the ocean carrier offers delivery to destination ports on 
U.S.-flag vessels, but foreign-flag vessels are used for any part of the 
voyage to the destination port without first obtaining the approval of 
the Cooperating Sponsor, KCCO, and any other approval that may be 
required by the Program Agreement, the ocean freight rate will be 
reduced to the lowest responsive foreign-flag vessel rate offered in 
response to the same invitation for bids and the carrier agrees to pay 
FAS the difference between the contracted ocean freight rate and the 
freight rate offered by such foreign-flag vessel.
    (f) Coordination between FAS and the Cooperating Sponsor. When a 
Program Agreement specifies that the Cooperating Sponsor will arrange 
ocean transportation:
    (1) FAS will provide that KCCO furnishes the Cooperating Sponsor, or 
its agent, a Notice of Commodity Availability (Form FAS-512) which will 
specify the receiving country, commodity, quantity, and date at U.S. 
port or intermodal delivery point.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall complete the Form FAS-512 
indicating name of steamship company, vessel name, vessel flag and 
estimated time of arrival at U.S. port; and shall sign and return the 
completed form to KCCO, with a copy to the Director, CCC-OD. If FAS 
agrees to pay any part of the ocean transportation for liner cargoes, 
the Cooperating Sponsor shall also indicate on the Form FAS-512 the 
applicable Federal Maritime Commission tariff rate, and tariff 
identification.
    (3) FAS will arrange for KCCO to issue instructions to have the 
commodity delivered f.a.s. or f.o.b. vessel, U.S. port of export or 
intermodal delivery point, consigned to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (g) Documents required for payment of freight--(1) General rule. To 
receive payment for ocean freight, the Cooperating Sponsor shall submit 
the following documents to the Director, CCC-OD:
    (i) One signed copy of completed Form FAS-512;
    (ii) Four copies of the original on-board bills of lading indicating 
the freight rate and signed by the originating carrier;
    (iii) For all non-containerized grain cargoes,
    (A) One signed copy of the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) 
Official Stowage Examination Certificate (Vessel Hold Certificate);
    (B) One signed copy of the National Cargo Bureau Certificate of 
Readiness (Vessel Hold Inspection Certificate); and
    (C) One signed copy of the National Cargo Bureau Certificate of 
Loading;
    (iv) For all containerized grain and grain product cargoes, one copy 
of the FGIS Container Condition Inspection Certificate;
    (v) One signed copy of liner booking note or charter party covering 
ocean transportation of cargo;
    (vi) For charter shipments, a signed notice of arrival at first 
discharge port submitted by the Cooperating Sponsor;
    (vii) For all liner cargoes, a copy of the tariff page;
    (viii) Four copies of either:
    (A) A request by the Cooperating Sponsor for reimbursement of ocean 
freight or ocean freight differential indicating the amount due, and 
accompanied by a certification from the ocean carrier that payment has 
been

[[Page 903]]

received from the Cooperating Sponsor; or
    (B) A request for direct payment to the ocean carrier, indicating 
amount due; or
    (C) A request for direct payment of ocean freight differential to 
the ocean carrier accompanied by a certification from the carrier that 
payment of the Cooperating Sponsor's portion of the ocean freight has 
been received.
    (ix) Each request to FAS for payment must provide a document, on 
letterhead and signed by an official or agent of the requester, the name 
of the entity to receive payment, the bank ABA number to which payment 
is to be made; the account number for the deposit at the bank; the 
requester's taxpayer identification number; and the type of the account 
into which funds will be deposited.
    (2) In cases of force majeure. To receive payment in cases where the 
Associate Administrator determines that circumstances of force majeure 
have prevented the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall submit all documents required by paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section except for the notice of arrival required by 
paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (h) FAS payment of ocean freight or ocean freight differential--(1) 
General rule. FAS will pay, not later than 30 days after receipt in good 
order of the required documentation, 100 percent of either the ocean 
freight or the ocean freight differential, whichever is specified in the 
Program Agreement.
    (2) Additional requirements after discharge. Where the charter party 
or liner booking note provide for the completion of additional services 
after discharge, such as bagging, stacking or inland transportation, FAS 
will pay, not later than 30 days after receipt in good order of the 
required documentation, either not more than 85 percent of the total 
freight charges or 100 percent of the ocean freight differential, 
whichever is specified in the Program Agreement. FAS will pay the 
remaining balance, if any, of the freight charges not later than 30 days 
after receipt of notification from the Cooperating Sponsor that such 
additional services have been provided; except that FAS will not pay any 
remaining balance where the Associate Administrator determines that the 
vessel's arrival at first port of discharge was prevented by force 
majeure.
    (3) No demurrage. FAS will not pay demurrage.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.8  Who arranges for entry and handling in the foreign country?

    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor shall make all necessary arrangements 
for receiving the commodities in the recipient country, including 
obtaining appropriate approvals for entry and transit. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall store and maintain the commodities from time of delivery 
at port of entry or point of receipt from originating carrier in good 
condition until their distribution, sale or barter.
    (b) When FAS has agreed to pay costs of transporting, storing, and 
distributing commodities from designated points of entry or ports of 
entry, the Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for such services, by 
through bill of lading, or by contracting directly with suppliers of 
services, as FAS may approve. If the Cooperating Sponsor contracts 
directly with the suppliers of such services, the Cooperating Sponsor 
may seek reimbursement by submitting documentation to FAS indicating 
actual costs incurred. All supporting documentation must be sent to the 
Director, CCC-OD. FAS, at its option, will reimburse the Cooperating 
Sponsor for the cost of such services in U.S. dollars at the exchange 
rate in effect on the date of payment by FAS, or in foreign currency.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.9  What are the restrictions on commodity use and distribution?

    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor may use the commodities provided only in 
accordance with the terms of the Program Agreement.
    (b) In the event that its participation in the program terminates, 
the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor will safeguard any undistributed 
commodities and sales proceeds and dispose of such commodities and 
proceeds as directed by FAS.

[[Page 904]]


<R05>
Sec. 1599.10  Are there special requirements for agreements between 
Cooperating Sponsor and Recipient Agencies?

    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor shall enter into a written agreement 
with a recipient agency prior to the transfer of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income to the recipient agency. Copies of such 
agreements shall be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, 
and the Director, PPDED. Such agreements shall require the recipient 
agency to pay the Cooperating Sponsor the value of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income that are used for purposes not expressly 
permitted under the Program Agreement, or that are lost, damaged, or 
misused as a result of the recipient agency's failure to exercise 
reasonable care;
    (b) FAS may waive the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
where it determines that such an agreement is not feasible or 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.11  What procedures apply to sales and barter of commodities 
provided and the use of proceeds?

    (a) Commodities may be sold or bartered without the prior approval 
of FAS where damage has rendered the commodities unfit for intended 
program purposes and sale or barter is necessary to mitigate loss of 
value.
    (b) A Cooperating Sponsor may, but is not required to, negotiate an 
agreement with the host government under which the commodities imported 
for a sale or barter may be imported, sold, or bartered without 
assessment of duties or taxes. In such cases and where the commodities 
are sold, they shall be sold at prices reflecting prevailing local 
market value.
    (c) The Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit all sale proceeds into an 
interest-bearing account unless prohibited by the laws or customs of the 
importing country or FAS determines that to do so would constitute an 
undue burden. Interest earned on such deposits shall only be used for 
approved activities.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the Cooperating 
Sponsor may use sale proceeds and resulting interest only for those 
purposes approved in the applicable Plan of Operation.
    (e) FAS will approve the use of sale proceeds and interest to 
purchase real and personal property where local law permits the 
Cooperating Sponsor to retain title to such property, but will not 
approve the use of sale proceeds or interest to pay for the acquisition, 
development, construction, alteration or upgrade of real property that 
is:
    (1) Owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged 
exclusively in religious activity, or
    (2) Used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes; except that, a 
Cooperating Sponsor may use such sale proceeds or interest to pay for 
repairs or rehabilitation of a structure located on such real property 
to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of provided 
commodities but only if such structure is not used in whole or in part 
for any religious or sectarian purposes while the provided commodities 
are stored in such structure. When not approved in the Plan of 
Operation, such use may be approved by the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache.
    (f) The Cooperating Sponsor shall follow commercially reasonable 
practices in procuring goods and services and when engaging in 
construction activity in accordance with the approved Plan of Operation. 
Such practices shall include procedures to prevent fraud, self-dealing 
and conflicts of interest, and shall foster free and open competition to 
the maximum extent practicable.
    (g) To the extent required by the Program Agreement, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall submit to the Director, PPDED, an inventory of all assets 
acquired with sale proceeds or interest or program income. In the event 
that its participation in the program terminates, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall dispose, at the direction of the Director, PPDED, of any 
property, real or personal, so acquired.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.12  What procedures apply to the processing, packaging and 
labeling of commodities in the foreign country?

    (a) Cooperating Sponsors may arrange for the processing of 
commodities provided under the Program Agreement, or for packaging or 
repackaging prior to distribution. When a third party provides such 
processing,

[[Page 905]]

packaging or repackaging, the Cooperating Sponsor shall enter into a 
written agreement requiring that the provider of such services maintain 
adequate records to account for all commodities delivered and submit 
periodic reports to the Cooperating Sponsor. The Cooperating Sponsor 
shall submit a copy of the executed agreement to the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache.
    (b) If, prior to distribution, the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for 
packaging or repackaging commodities, the packaging shall be plainly 
labeled in the language of the country in which the commodities are to 
be distributed with the name of the commodity and, except where the 
commodities are to be sold or bartered after processing, packaging or 
repackaging, to indicate that the commodity is furnished by the people 
of the United States of America and not to be sold or exchanged. If the 
commodities are not packaged, the Cooperating Sponsor shall, to the 
extent practicable, display banners, posters or other media containing 
the information prescribed in this paragraph.
    (c) FAS will reimburse Cooperating Sponsors that are nonprofit 
private voluntary organizations or cooperatives for expenses incurred 
for repackaging if the packages of commodities are discharged from the 
vessel in damaged condition, and are repackaged to ensure that the 
commodities arrive at the distribution point in wholesome condition. No 
prior approval is required for such expenses equaling $500 or less. If 
such expense is estimated to exceed $500, the authority to repackage and 
incur such expense must be approved by the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache in advance of repackaging.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.13  How does the Cooperating Sponsor dispose of commodities 
unfit for authorized use?

    (a) Prior to delivery to Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or 
point of entry. If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a 
governmental Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or point of entry 
overseas, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache will immediately arrange 
for inspection by a public health official or other competent authority. 
If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a nongovernmental 
Cooperating Sponsor at the discharge port or point of entry, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for such inspection. 
If inspection discloses the commodity to be unfit for the use authorized 
in the Program Agreement, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose of the commodities in 
accordance with the priority set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Expenses incidental to the handling and disposition of the damaged 
commodity will be paid by FAS from the sale proceeds or from an 
appropriate FAS account designated by FAS. The net proceeds of sales 
shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, 
in an account designated by FAS; however, if the commodities are 
provided for a sales program, the net sale proceeds, net of expenses 
incidental to handling and disposition of the damaged commodity, shall 
be deposited to the special account established for sale proceeds. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall consult with FAS regarding the inspection and 
disposition of commodities and accounting for sale proceeds in the event 
the Cooperating Sponsor executed a sales agreement under which title 
passed to the purchaser prior to delivery to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (b) After delivery to Cooperating Sponsor. (1) If after arrival in a 
foreign country and after delivery to a Cooperating Sponsor, it appears 
that the commodity, or any part thereof, may be unfit for the use 
authorized in the Program Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall 
immediately arrange for inspection of the commodity by a public health 
official or other competent authority approved by the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache. If no competent local authority is available, the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache may determine whether the commodities 
are unfit for the use authorized in the Program Agreement and, if so, 
may direct disposal in accordance with this paragraph. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall arrange for the recovery of that portion of the 
commodities designated during the inspection as suitable for authorized 
use. If, upon inspection, the

[[Page 906]]

commodity (or any part thereof) is determined to be unfit for the 
authorized use, the Cooperating Sponsor shall notify the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache of the circumstances pertaining to the loss or 
damage. With the concurrence of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, 
the commodity determined to be unfit for authorized use shall be 
disposed of in the following order of priority:
    (i) By transfer to an approved USDA sponsored program for use as 
livestock feed. FAS shall be advised promptly of any such transfer so 
that shipments from the United States to the livestock feeding program 
can be reduced by an equivalent amount;
    (ii) Sale for the most appropriate use, i.e., animal feed, 
fertilizer, or industrial use, at the highest obtainable price. When the 
commodity is sold, all U.S. Government markings shall be obliterated or 
removed;
    (iii) By donation to a governmental or charitable organization for 
use as animal feed or for other non-food use; or
    (iv) If the commodity is unfit for any use or if disposal in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section is 
not possible, the commodity shall be destroyed under the observation of 
a representative of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, if 
practicable, in such manner as to prevent its use for any purpose.
    (2) Actual expenses incurred, including third party costs, in 
effecting any sale may be deducted from the sale proceeds and, if the 
commodities were intended for direct distribution, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall deposit the net proceeds with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, 
American Embassy, with instructions to credit the deposit to an account 
as designated by FAS. If the commodities were intended to be sold, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit the gross proceeds into the special 
interest bearing account and, after approved costs related to the 
handling and disposition of damaged commodities are paid, shall use the 
remaining funds for purposes of the approved program. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall promptly furnish to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache 
a written report of all circumstances relating to the loss and damage on 
any commodity loss in excess of $5,000; quarterly reports shall be made 
on all other losses. If the commodity was inspected by a public health 
official or other competent authority, the report and any supplemental 
report shall include a certification by such public health official or 
other competent authority as to the condition of the commodity and the 
exact quantity of the damaged commodity disposed. Such certification 
shall be obtained as soon as possible after the discharge of the cargo. 
A report must also be provided to the Chief, Debt Management Division, 
KCMO/DMD, of action taken to dispose of commodities unfit for authorized 
use.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.14  How is liability established for loss, damage, or improper 
distribution of commodities?

    (a) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor prior to loading on ocean vessel. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify KCCO, Chief, Export 
Operations Division if the Cooperating Sponsor will not have a vessel 
for loading at the U.S. port of export in accordance with the agreed 
shipping schedule. FAS will determine whether the commodity will be: 
Moved to another available outlet; stored at the port for delivery to 
the Cooperating Sponsor when a vessel is available for loading; or 
disposed of as FAS may deem proper. The Cooperating Sponsor shall take 
such action as directed by FAS and shall reimburse FAS for expenses 
incurred if FAS determines that the expenses were incurred because of 
the fault or negligence of the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (b) Fault of others prior to loading on ocean vessel. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify the Chief, Debt Management 
Office, KCMO/DMD, when any damage or loss to the commodity occurs that 
is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier, or other person between the 
time title is transferred to a Cooperating Sponsor and the time the 
commodity is loaded on board vessel at the designated port of export. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly assign to CCC any rights to 
claims which may arise as a result of such loss or damage and shall 
promptly forward

[[Page 907]]

to CCC all documents pertaining thereto. CCC shall have the right to 
initiate claims, and retain the proceeds of all claims, for such loss or 
damage.
    (c) Survey and outturn reports related to claims against ocean 
carriers. (1) If the Program Agreement provides that CCC will arrange 
for an independent cargo surveyor to attend the discharge of the cargo, 
CCC will require the surveyor to provide a copy of the report to the 
Cooperating Sponsor.
    (2)(i) If the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for an independent cargo 
surveyor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall forward to the Chief, Debt 
Management Office, KCMO/DMD, any narrative chronology or other 
commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean 
transportation claims and shall prepare such a narrative in any case 
where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00. The 
Cooperating Sponsor may, at its option, also engage the independent 
surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs 
or port areas to the Cooperating Sponsor or its agent and to issue 
delivery survey reports thereon.
    (ii) In the event of cargo loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall provide to the Chief, Debt Management Office, KCMO/DMD, the names 
and addresses of individuals who were present at the time of discharge 
and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. For 
bulk grain shipments, in those cases where the Cooperating Sponsor is 
responsible for survey and outturn reports, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to:
    (A) Observe the discharge of the cargo;
    (B) Report on discharging methods including scale type, calibrations 
and any other factor which may affect the accuracy of scale weights, 
and, if scales are not used, state the reason therefore and describe the 
actual method used to determine weights;
    (C) Estimate the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge 
through carrier negligence;
    (D) Advise on the quality of sweepings;
    (E) Obtain copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing 
quantity discharged;
    (F) Provide immediate notification to the Cooperating Sponsor if 
additional services are necessary to protect cargo interests or if the 
surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not 
discharged; and
    (G) In the case of shipments arriving in container vans, list the 
container van numbers and seal numbers shown on the container vans, and 
indicate whether the seals were intact at the time the container vans 
were opened, and whether the container vans were in any way damaged. To 
the extent possible, the independent surveyor should observe discharge 
of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the 
container van occurred and arrange for surveying as container vans are 
opened.
    (iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCMO/DMD, Chief, 
Debt Management Office of all reports and documents pertaining to the 
discharge of commodities.
    (iv) FAS will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for costs incurred 
upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other 
documents that establish the survey cost. FAS will not reimburse a 
Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of a delivery survey unless the 
surveyor also prepares a discharge survey, or for any other survey not 
taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless FAS 
determines that such action was justified in the circumstances.
    (3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless 
FAS determines that the use of competitive bids would not be 
practicable. FAS may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of 
conflicts of interest or lack of demonstrated capability to properly 
carry out surveying responsibilities.
    (4) If practicable, all surveys shall be conducted jointly by the 
surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report 
shall be signed by all parties.
    (d) Ocean carrier loss and damage. (1) Notwithstanding transfer of 
title, CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and retain the proceeds 
of collection from claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss 
and damage arising

[[Page 908]]

out of shipments of commodities provided to governmental Cooperating 
Sponsors; however, when the Cooperating Sponsor pays the ocean freight 
or a portion thereof, it shall be entitled to pro rata reimbursement 
received from any claims related to ocean freight charged. FAS will pay 
general average contributions for all valid general average incidents 
which may arise from the movement of commodity to the destination ports. 
CCC shall receive and retain all allowances in general average.
    (2) Nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors shall: File notice with the 
ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any cargo loss or damage, 
promptly initiate claims against the ocean carriers for such loss and 
damage, take all necessary action to obtain restitution for losses, and 
provide CCC copies of all such claims. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor need not file a claim 
when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the loss is 
between $100 and $300 and the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor 
determines that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will exceed 
the amount of the claim. The nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall 
transmit to KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt Management Office information and 
documentation on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to be 
filed. In the event of a declaration of General Average:
    (i) The Cooperating sponsor shall assign all claim rights to CCC and 
shall provide CCC all documentation relating to the claim, if 
applicable;
    (ii) CCC shall be responsible for settling general average and 
marine salvage claims;
    (iii) FAS has sole authority to authorize any dispositions of 
commodities which have not commenced ocean transit or of which the ocean 
transit is interrupted;
    (iv) FAS will receive and retain any monetary proceeds resulting 
from such disposition;
    (v) CCC will initiate, prosecute, and retain all proceeds of cargo 
loss and damage against ocean carriers and any allowance in general 
average; and
    (vi) FAS will pay any general average or marine salvage claims 
determined to be due.
    (3) Amounts collected by nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors on 
claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained 
by the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor. On claims involving loss or 
damage of $200 or more, nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors may retain 
from collections received by them, either $200 plus 10 percent of the 
difference between $200 and the total amount collected on the claim, up 
to a maximum of $500; or the actual administrative expenses incurred in 
collection of the claim, provided retention of such administrative 
expenses is approved by CCC. Allowable collection costs shall not 
include attorneys fees, fees of collection agencies, and similar costs. 
In no event will FAS pay collection costs in excess of the amount 
collected on the claim.
    (4) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor also may retain from claim 
recoveries remaining after allowable deductions for administrative 
expenses of collection, the amount of any special charges, such as 
handling and packing costs, which the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor has incurred on the lost or damaged commodity and which are 
included in the claims and paid by the liable party.
    (5) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may redetermine claims on 
the basis of additional documentation or information not considered when 
the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information 
clearly changes the ocean carrier's liability. Approval of such changes 
by FAS is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of 
redetermined claims and supporting documentation or information shall be 
furnished to FAS.
    (6) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may negotiate compromise 
settlements of claims of any amount, provided that proposed compromise 
settlements of claims having a value of $5,000 or more shall require 
prior approval in writing by FAS. When a claim is compromised, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may retain from the amount 
collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, 
and in addition, an

[[Page 909]]

amount representing such percentage of the special charges described in 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section as compromised amount is to the full 
amount of the claim. When a claim is less than $600, a nongovernmental 
Cooperating Sponsor may terminate collection activity when it is 
determined that pursuit of such claims will not be economically sound. 
Approval for such termination by FAS is not required; however, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall notify KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt 
Management Division when collection activity on a claim is terminated.
    (7) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized in 
this section to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the purpose of 
determining the amount to be retained by a nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against ocean carriers, the 
word ``claim'' shall refer to the loss and damage to commodities which 
are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port 
destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the 
number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier.
    (8) If a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor is unable to effect 
collection of a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement 
within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof 
granted in writing by the party alleged responsible for the damage, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall assign its rights to the claim 
to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of legal action prior to 
the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. 
Generally, a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor should assign claim 
rights to CCC no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the 
period of limitation or any extension thereof. In all cases, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall keep CCC informed of the 
progress of its collection efforts and shall promptly assign their claim 
rights to CCC upon request. Subsequently, if CCC collects on or settles 
the claim, CCC shall, except as indicated in this paragraph, pay to a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor the amount to which it would have 
been entitled had it collected on the claim. The additional 10 percent 
on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable, however, only if 
CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim 
prior to the assignment, or if payment is determined to be commensurate 
with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting the claim. If 
documentation requirements have not been fulfilled and the lack of such 
documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction of CCC, CCC 
will deny payment of all allowances to the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor.
    (9) When a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor permits a claim to 
become time-barred, or fails to take timely actions to insure the right 
of CCC to assert such claims, and CCC determines that the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor failed to properly exercise its 
responsibilities under the Agreement, the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor shall be liable to the United States for the cost and freight 
value of the commodities lost to the program.
    (e) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor in country of distribution. If a 
commodity, sale proceeds or program income is used for a purpose not 
permitted by the Program Agreement, or if a Cooperating Sponsor causes 
loss or damage to a commodity, sale proceeds, or program income through 
any act or omission or failure to provide proper storage, care and 
handling, FAS may require the Cooperating Sponsor to pay to the United 
States the value of the commodities, sale proceeds or program income 
lost, damaged or misused, or undertake other remedies FAS deems 
appropriate. FAS will consider normal commercial practices in the 
country of distribution in determining whether there was a proper 
exercise of the Cooperating Sponsor's responsibility. Payment by the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (f) Fault of others in country of distribution and in intermediate 
country. (1) In addition to survey or outturn reports to determine ocean 
carrier loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor

[[Page 910]]

shall, in the case of landlocked countries, arrange for an independent 
survey at the point of entry into the recipient country and make a 
report as set forth in paragraph (c)(l) of this section. FAS will 
reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of survey as set forth 
in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (2) Where any damage to or loss of the commodity or any loss of sale 
proceeds or program income is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier or 
other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort 
to pursue collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file 
or pursue such claims shall be liable to FAS for the value of the 
commodities or sale proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or 
misused: Provided, however, that the Cooperating Sponsor may elect not 
to file a claim if the loss is less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In 
addition, Cooperating Sponsors may, with the written approval of the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache, retain amounts to cover special costs 
of collection such as legal fees, or pay such collection costs with sale 
proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than the 
full amount of the claim requires prior approval by the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache. When the Cooperating Sponsor has exhausted all 
reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache to provide further instructions.
    (3) The Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial 
billings and at least three subsequent demands at not more than 30 day 
intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, the 
cooperating sponsor shall pursue legal action in the judicial system of 
country unless otherwise agreed by the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache. The Cooperating Sponsors must inform the Agricultural Counselor 
or Attache in writing of the reasons for not pursuing legal action; and 
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require the Cooperating 
Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its 
decision prior to granting approval. If the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further 
action on the claim, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the claim to 
CCC and shall forward all documentation relating to the claim to CCC.
    (4) As an alternative to legal action in the judicial system of the 
country with regard to claims against a public entity of the government 
of the cooperating country, the Cooperating Sponsor and the cooperating 
country may agree in writing to settle disputed claims by an appropriate 
administrative procedure or arbitration.
    (g) Determination of value. The Cooperating Sponsor shall determine 
the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged on the basis of the 
domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage 
occurred. When it is not feasible to determine such market price, the 
value shall be the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the 
commodity at the time and place of export, plus ocean freight charges 
and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to 
the Cooperating Sponsor. When the value is determined on a cost basis, 
the Cooperating Sponsor may add to the value any provable costs it has 
incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim 
statement, these costs shall be clearly segregated from costs incurred 
by the Government of the United States. With respect to claims other 
than ocean carrier loss or damage claims, the Cooperating Sponsor may 
request the Agricultural Counselor or Attache to approve a commercially 
reasonable alternative basis to value the claim.
    (h) Reporting losses to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or FAS 
designated representative. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly 
notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or FAS designated 
representative, in writing, of the circumstances pertaining to any loss, 
damage, or misuse of commodities valued at $500 or more occurring within 
the country of distribution or intermediate country. The report shall be

[[Page 911]]

made as soon as the Cooperating Sponsor has adequately investigated the 
circumstances, but in no event more than ninety days from the date the 
loss became known to the Cooperating Sponsor. The report shall identify 
the party in possession of the commodities and the party responsible for 
the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantities of commodities; the 
size and type of containers; the time and place of misuse, loss, or 
damage; the current location of the commodity; the Program Agreement 
number, the procurement contract numbers, or if unknown, other 
identifying numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action 
taken by the Cooperating Sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; 
and the estimated value of the commodity. The report shall explain why 
any of the above-required information can not be provided. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall also report the details regarding any loss or 
misuse of sale proceeds or program income.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall report quarterly to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache any loss, damage to or misuse of 
commodities resulting in loss of less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
shall inform the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or FAS designated 
representative if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend 
in the loss, damage, or misuse of such commodities and submit a report 
as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, together with any 
other relevant information the Cooperating Sponsor has available to it. 
The Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require additional information 
about any commodities lost, damaged or misused.
    (i) Handling claims proceeds. Claims against ocean carriers shall be 
collected in U.S. dollars (or in the currency in which freight is paid) 
and shall be remitted (less amounts authorized to be retained) by 
Cooperating Sponsors to CCC. Claims against Cooperating Sponsors shall 
be paid to CCC in U.S. dollars. With respect to commodities lost, 
damaged or misused, amounts paid by Cooperating Sponsors and third 
parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the U.S. 
Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably in U.S. dollars with 
instructions to credit the deposit to an account as determined by FAS, 
or in local currency at the highest rate of exchange legally obtainable 
on the date of deposit with instructions to credit the deposit to an FAS 
account as determined by FAS. With respect to sale proceeds and program 
income, amounts recovered may be deposited in the same account as the 
sale proceeds and may be used for purposes of the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.15  Are there special record keeping and reporting 
requirements?

    (a) Records and reports--general requirements. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall maintain records for a period of three (3) years from the 
final date specified in the program agreement. FAS may, at reasonable 
times, inspect the Cooperating Sponsor's records pertaining to the 
receipt and use of the commodities and proceeds realized from the sale 
of the commodities, and have access to the Cooperating Sponsor's 
commodity storage and distribution sites and to locations of activities 
supported with proceeds realized from the sale of the commodities.
    (b) Evidence of export. The Cooperating Sponsor's freight forwarder 
shall, within thirty (30) days after export, submit evidence of export 
of the agricultural commodities to the Chief, Export Operations 
Division, KCCO. If export is by sea or air, the Cooperating Sponsor's 
freight forwarder shall submit five copies of the carrier's on board 
bill of lading or consignee's receipt authenticated by a representative 
of the U.S. Customs Service. The evidence of export must show the kind 
and quantity of agricultural commodities exported, the date of export, 
and the destination country.
    (c) Reports. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall submit a semiannual 
logistics report to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache and to the 
Director, PPDED, FAS/USDA, Washington, DC 20250-1034, covering the 
receipt of commodities. Cooperating sponsors must submit reports on Form 
CCC-620 and submit the first report by May 16 for agreements signed 
during the period, October 1 through March 31, or by November 16

[[Page 912]]

for agreements signed during the period, April 1 through September 30. 
The first report must cover the time period from the date of signing and 
subsequent reports must be provided at six months intervals covering the 
period from the due date of the last report until all commodities have 
been distributed or sold and such distribution or sale reported to FAS. 
The report must contain the following data:
    (i) Receipts of agricultural commodities including the name of each 
vessel, discharge port(s) or point(s) of entry, the date discharge was 
completed, the condition of the commodities on arrival, any significant 
loss or damage in transit; advice of any claim for, or recovery of, or 
reduction of freight charges due to loss or damage in transit on 
vessels;
    (ii) Estimated commodity inventory at the end of the reporting 
period;
    (iii) Quantity of commodity on order during the reporting period;
    (iv) Status of claims for commodity losses both resolved and 
unresolved during the reporting period;
    (v) Quantity of commodity damaged or declared unfit during the 
reporting period; and
    (vi) Quantity and type of the commodity that has been directly 
distributed by the Cooperating Sponsor, distribution date, region of 
distribution, and estimated number of individuals benefitting from the 
distribution.
    (2) Program Agreements will require Cooperating Sponsors to report 
periodically, against collected, established baseline indicators, on the 
number of meals served, enrollment levels, total attendance numbers, 
including female attendance levels, learning developments, nutrition and 
health progress of mothers and children, and progress towards sustaining 
the feeding program.
    (3) If the Program Agreement authorizes the sale or barter of 
commodities by the Cooperating Sponsor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall 
also submit a semiannual monetization report to the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache and to the Director, PPDED, FAS/USDA, Washington, 
DC 20250-1034, covering the deposits into and disbursements from the 
special account for the purposes specified in the Program Agreement. 
Cooperating Sponsors must submit reports on Form CCC-621 and submit the 
first report by May 16 for agreements signed during the period, October 
1 through March 31, or by November 16 for agreements signed during the 
period, April 1 through September 30. The first report must cover the 
time period from the date of signing and subsequent reports must be 
provided at six months intervals covering the period from the due date 
of the last report until all funds generated from commodity sales have 
been distributed and such distribution reported to FAS. The report must 
contain the following information and include both local currency 
amounts and U.S. dollar equivalents:
    (i) Quantity and type of commodities sold;
    (ii) Proceeds generated from the sale;
    (iii) Proceeds deposited to the special account including the date 
of deposit;
    (iv) Interest earned on the special account;
    (v) Disbursements from the special account, including date, amount 
and purpose of the disbursement; and
    (vi) Any balance carried forward in the special account from the 
previous reporting period.
    (4) The Cooperating Sponsor shall furnish FAS such additional 
information and reports relating to this agreement as FAS may reasonably 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.16  What are the Cooperating Sponsor's audit requirements?

    Non-governmental Cooperating Sponsors are subject to the audit 
requirements of OMB Circular A-133 as implemented in USDA by 7 CFR part 
3052, ``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit 
Organizations.'' The Cooperating Sponsor is also responsible for 
auditing the activities of recipient agencies that receive more than 
$25,000 of provided commodities or sale proceeds. This responsibility 
may be satisfied by relying upon independent audits of the recipient 
agency or upon a review conducted by the Cooperating Sponsor.

[[Page 913]]


<R05>
Sec. 1599.17  When may FAS suspend a program?

    All or any part of the assistance provided under a Program 
Agreement, including commodities in transit, may be suspended by FAS if:
    (a) The Cooperating Sponsor fails to comply with the provisions of 
the Program Agreement or this part;
    (b) FAS determines that the continuation of such assistance is no 
longer necessary or desirable; or
    (c) FAS determines that storage facilities are inadequate to prevent 
spoilage or waste, or that distribution of commodities will result in 
substantial disincentive to, or interference with, domestic production 
or marketing in the recipient country.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.18  Are there sample documents and guidelines available for 
developing proposals and reports?

    FAS has developed guidelines to assist the Cooperating Sponsors with 
effective reporting on program logistics and commodity sales. 
Cooperating Sponsors may obtain these guidelines from the Director, 
PPDED.


<R05>
Sec. 1599.19  Has the Office of Management and Budget reviewed the 
paperwork and record keeping requirements contained in this part?

    The paperwork and record keeping requirements imposed by this part 
have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq.). OMB 
has assigned control number 0051-0039 for this information collection.
