                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1999), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

together with a copy of the proposal, requesting the Secretary to hold a 
hearing upon the proposal. Upon receipt of such proposal, the 
Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made and such 
consideration to be given as, in the Administrator's opinion, are 
warranted. If the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator 
to conclude that the proposed order will not tend to effectuate the 
declared policy of the Act, or that for other proper reasons a hearing

application, and promptly notify the applicant of such denial, which 
notice shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds for the 
denial.

provided herein.

    (a) Filing and contents of the notice of hearing. The proceeding 
shall be instituted by filing the notice of hearing with the hearing 
clerk. The notice of hearing shall contain a reference to the authority 
under which the order is proposed; shall define the scope of the hearing 
as specifically as may be practicable; shall contain either the terms or 
substance of the proposed order or a description of the subjects and 
issues involved; and shall state the time and place of such hearing, and 
the place where copies of such proposed order may be obtained or 
examined. The time of the hearing shall not be less than 15 days after 
the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register, as 
provided herein, unless the Administrator shall determine that an 
emergency exists which requires a shorter period of notice, in which 
case the period of notice shall be that which the Administrator may 
determine to be reasonable in the circumstances: Except that in the case

Columbia that are directly affected by such order.

notice is given in the manner provided by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section; failure to give notice in the manner provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not affect the 
legality of the notice.

affidavit or certificate of the person giving the notice provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section. In regard to the 
provisions relating to mailing in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, 
determination by the Administrator that such provisions have been

section there shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the

<R05>
Sec. 1200.6  Docket number.

    Each proceeding, immediately following its institution, shall be 
assigned a docket number by the hearing clerk and thereafter the

<R05>
Sec. 1200.7  Judge.

    (a) Assignment. No judge who has any pecuniary interest in the 
outcome of a proceeding shall serve as judge in such proceeding.
    (b) Power of judge. Subject to review by the Secretary, as provided 
elsewhere in this subpart, the judge in any proceeding shall have power 
to:
    (1) Rule upon motions and requests;
    (2) Change the time and place of hearings, and adjourn the hearing 
from time to time or from place to place;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;
    (4) Examine and cross-examine witnesses and receive evidence;
    (5) Admit or exclude evidence;
    (6) Hear oral argument on facts or law; and
    (7) Do all acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance 
of order at the hearings and the efficient conduct of the proceeding.
    (c) Who may act in absence of judge. In case of the absence of the 
judge or the judge's inability to act, the powers and duties to be 
performed by the judge under this part in connection with a proceeding 
may, without abatement of the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the 
Secretary, be assigned to any other judge.
    (d) Disqualification of judge. The judge may at any time withdraw as 
judge in a proceeding if such judge deems himself or herself to be 
disqualified. Upon the filing by an interested person in good faith of a 
timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of 
a judge, the Secretary shall determine the matter as a part of the 
record and decision in the proceeding, after making such investigation 
or holding such hearings, or both, as the Secretary may deem appropriate 
in the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.8  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. (1) All motions and requests shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during the course of the hearing 
may be filed with the judge or may be stated orally and made a part of 
the transcript.
    (2) Except as provided in Sec. 1200.17(b) such motions and requests 
shall be addressed to, and ruled on by, the judge if made prior to 
certification of the transcript pursuant to Sec. 1200.11 or by the 
Secretary if made thereafter.
    (b) Certification to Secretary. The judge may, in his or her 
discretion, submit or certify to the Secretary for decision any motion, 
request, objection, or other question addressed to the judge.

[[Page 10]]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.9  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) Time and place. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
fixed in the notice of hearing, unless the judge shall have changed the 
time or place, in which event the judge shall file with the hearing 
clerk a notice of such change, which notice shall be given in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 1200.5 (relating to the giving of notice of 
the hearing): Except that if the change in time or place of hearing is 
made less than five days prior to the date previously fixed for the 
hearing, the judge either in addition to or in lieu of causing the 
notice of the change to be given, shall announce, or cause to be 
announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed for the 
hearing.
    (b) Appearances--(1) Right to appear. At the hearing, any interested 
person shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in person or 
through authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with 
respect to matters relevant and material to the proceeding. Any 
interested person who desires to be heard in person at any hearing under 
these rules shall, before proceeding to testify, state his or her name, 
address, and occupation. If any such person is appearing through a 
counsel or representative, such person or such counsel or representative 
shall, before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the 
hearing, state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or 
representative, and the names, addresses, and occupations of such person 
and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such counsel or 
representative shall give such other information respecting such 
appearance as the judge may request.
    (2) Debarment of counsel or representative. (i) Whenever, while a 
proceeding is pending before the judge, such judge finds that a person, 
acting as counsel or representative for any person participating in the 
proceeding, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge 
may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel 
or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be 
taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or 
suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Except that the judge may 
suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling 
the client to obtain other counsel or representative.
    (ii) In case the judge has ordered that a person be precluded from 
further action as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the judge 
within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the Secretary a 
report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order and shall 
recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other 
proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after 
notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings 
before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
    (3) Failure to appear. If any interested person fails to appear at 
the hearing, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to be 
heard in the proceeding.
    (c) Order of procedure. (1) The judge shall, at the opening of the 
hearing prior to the taking of testimony, have noted as part of the 
record the notice of hearing as filed with the Office of the Federal 
Register and the affidavit or certificate of the giving of notice or the 
determination provided for in Sec. 1200.5(c).
    (2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters 
specified in the notice of the hearing in such order as the judge shall 
announce.
    (d) Evidence--(1) General. The hearing shall be publicly conducted, 
and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.
    (i) Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or 
make affirmation. Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (ii) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the 
hearing, the judge may limit the number of times any witness may testify 
to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative 
evidence.
    (iii) The judge shall, insofar as practicable, exclude evidence 
which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not 
of the sort upon

[[Page 11]]

which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to any other ruling of the judge during the hearing, 
such party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon 
an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the 
judge. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon 
except as ordered by the judge. The ruling of the judge on any objection 
shall be a part of the transcript. Only objections made before the judge 
may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible as evidence without the presence of the person who made or 
prepared the same. The judge shall exercise discretion in determining 
whether an official publication of such record or document shall be 
necessary, or whether a copy would be permissible. If permissible such a 
copy should be attested to by the person having legal custody of it, and 
accompanied by a certificate that such person has the custody.
    (4) Exhibits. All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon satisfactory showing of 
authenticity, relevancy, and materiality, be numbered as exhibits and 
received in evidence and made a part of the record. Such exhibits shall 
be submitted in quadruplicate and in documentary form. In case the 
required number of copies is not made available, the judge shall 
exercise discretion as to whether said exhibits shall, when practicable, 
be read in evidence or whether additional copies shall be required to be 
submitted within a time to be specified by the judge. If the testimony 
of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report or document (including 
the record of any previous hearing), the judge, after inquiry relating 
to the identification of such statute, report, or document, shall 
determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and 
physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it 
shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and 
material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report or document 
(including the record of any previous hearing) containing immaterial or 
irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be 
excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the 
direction of the judge.
    (5) Official notice. Official notice at the hearing may be taken of 
such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United 
States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial 
fact of established character: Except that interested persons shall be 
given an adequate period of time, at the hearing or subsequent to it, of 
matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.
    (6) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a 
brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence 
consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be 
inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be 
considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the 
judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall 
not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such 
evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In 
the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the judge erred in 
excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing 
shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.10  Oral and written arguments.

    (a) Oral argument before the judge. Oral argument before the judge 
shall be in the discretion of the judge. Such argument, when permitted, 
may be limited by the judge to any extent that the judge finds necessary 
for the expeditious disposition of the proceeding and shall be reduced 
to writing and made part of the transcript.

[[Page 12]]

    (b) Briefs, proposed findings, and conclusions. The judge shall 
announce at the hearing a reasonable period of time within which 
interested persons may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings and 
conclusions, and written arguments or briefs, based upon the evidence 
received at the hearing, citing, where practicable, the page or pages of 
the transcript of the testimony where such evidence appears. Factual 
material other than that adduced at the hearing or subject to official 
notice shall not be alluded to therein, and, in any case, shall not be 
considered in the formulation of the order. If the person filing a brief 
desires the Secretary to consider any objection made by such person to a 
ruling of the judge, as provided in Sec. 1200.9(d), that person shall 
include in the brief a concise statement concerning each such objection, 
referring, where practicable, to the pertinent pages of the transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.11  Certification of the transcript.

    The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing 
as soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written 
arguments, briefs, proposed findings, and proposed conclusions and shall 
furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be 
necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall 
transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the 
transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the 
exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. The 
judge shall attach to the original transcript of the testimony a 
certificate stating that, to the best of the judge's knowledge and 
belief, the transcript is a true transcript of the testimony given at 
the hearing, except in such particulars as the judge shall specify, and 
that the exhibits transmitted are all the exhibits as introduced at the 
hearing with such exceptions as the judge shall specify. A copy of such 
certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the transcript of 
testimony. In accordance with such certificate the hearing clerk shall 
note upon the official record copy, and cause to be noted on other 
copies of the transcript, each correction detailed therein by adding or 
crossing out (but without obscuring the text as originally transcribed) 
at the appropriate place any words necessary to make the same conform to 
the correct meaning, as certified by the judge. The hearing clerk shall 
obtain and file certifications to the effect that such corrections have 
been effectuated in copies other than the official record copy.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.12  Copies of the transcript.

    (a) During the period in which the proceeding has an active status 
in the Department, a copy of the transcript and exhibits shall be kept 
on file in the office of the hearing clerk where it shall be available 
for examination during official hours of business. Thereafter said 
transcript and exhibits shall be made available by the hearing clerk for 
examination during official hours of business after prior request and 
reasonable notice to the hearing clerk.
    (b) If a personal copy of the transcript is desired, such copy may 
be obtained upon written application filed with the reporter and upon 
payment of fees at a rate that may be agreed upon with the reporter.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.13  Administrator's recommended decision.

    (a) Preparation. As soon as practicable following the termination of 
the period allowed for the filing of written arguments or briefs and 
proposed findings and conclusions the Administrator shall file with the 
hearing clerk a recommended decision.
    (b) Contents. The Administrator's recommended decision shall 
include: (1) a preliminary statement containing a description of the 
history of the proceedings, a brief explanation of the material issues 
of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, and proposed 
findings and conclusions about such issues, including the reasons or 
basis for such proposed findings; (2) a ruling upon each proposed 
finding or conclusion submitted by interested persons; and (3) an 
appropriate proposed order effectuating the Administrator's 
recommendations.
    (c) Exceptions to recommended decision. Immediately following the 
filing of the

[[Page 13]]

recommended decision, the Administrator shall give notice thereof and 
opportunity to file exceptions thereto by publication in the Federal 
Register. Within a period of time specified in such notice any 
interested person may file with the hearing clerk exceptions to the 
Administrator's proposed order and a brief in support of such 
exceptions. Such exceptions shall be in writing, shall refer, where 
practicable, to the related pages of the transcript, and may suggest 
appropriate changes in the proposed order.
    (d) Omission of recommended decision. The procedure provided in this 
section may be omitted only if the Secretary finds on the basis of the 
record that due and timely execution of the Secretary's functions 
imperatively and unavoidably requires such omission.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.14  Submission to Secretary.

    Upon the expiration of the period allowed for filing exceptions or 
upon request of the Secretary, the hearing clerk shall transmit to the 
Secretary the record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: All 
motions and requests filed with the hearing clerk and rulings thereon; 
the certified transcript; any proposed findings or conclusions or 
written arguments or briefs that may have been filed; the 
Administrator's recommended decision, if any; and such exceptions as may

reasons or basis for such findings, upon all the material issues of 
fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, (b) a ruling upon each 
proposed finding and proposed conclusion not previously ruled upon in 
the record, (c) a ruling upon each exception filed by interested 
persons, and (d) either (1) denial of the proposal to issue an order, or 
(2) if the findings upon the record so warrant, an order, the provisions 
of which shall be set forth and such order shall be complete except for 
its effective date and any determinations to be made under Sec. 1200.16: 
Except that such order shall not be executed, issued, or made effective 
until and unless the Secretary determines that the requirements of 
Sec. 1200.16 have been met.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.16  Execution of the order.

    (a) Issuance of the order. The Secretary shall, if the Secretary

decision pursuant to Sec. 1200.15: Except that the issuance of such 
order shall have been approved or favored by eligible voters as required 
by the applicable Act.
    (b) Effective date of order. No order shall become effective in less 
than 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register, unless the

shall be filed with the hearing clerk, and notice thereof, together with

but before it is transmitted to the secretary), or by the Secretary

<R05>
Sec. 1205.341  Certification of cotton producer organization.

    Any cotton producer organization within a cotton-producing State may 
request the Secretary for certification of eligibility to participate in 
nominating members and alternate members to represent such State on the 
Cotton Board. Such eligibility shall be based in addition to other 
available information upon a factual report submitted by the 
organization which shall contain information deemed relevant and 
specified by the Secretary for the making of such determination, 
including the following:
    (a) Geographic territory within the State covered by the 
organization's active membership;
    (b) Nature and size of the organization's active membership in the 
State, proportion of total of such active membership accounted for by 
farmers, a map showing the cotton-producing counties in such State in 
which the organization has members, the volume of cotton produced in 
each such county, the number of cotton producers in each such county, 
and the size of the organization's active cotton producer membership in 
each such county;

a sufficiently large number of cotton producers who produce a relatively 
significant volume of cotton to reasonably warrant its participation in 
the nomination of members for the Cotton Board. Any cotton producer 
organization found eligible by the Secretary under this Sec. 1205.341 
will be certified by the Secretary, and the Secretary's determination as 
to eligibility is final.

volume of cotton to reasonably warrant its participation in the 
nomination of members for the Cotton Board. Any importer organization 
found eligible by the Secretary under this Sec. 1205.342 will be 
certified by the Secretary, and the Secretary's determination as to 
eligibility is final.

<R05>
Sec. 1205.510  Levy of assessments.

    (a) Producer assessments. An assessment of $1 per bale for cotton 
research and promotion is hereby levied on each bale of Upland cotton 
that is produced from cotton harvested and ginned except cotton consumed 
by any governmental agency from its own production. Such assessment 
shall be payable and collected only once on each bale.
    (1) A supplemental assessment for cotton research and promotion in 
addition to the $1 per bale assessment provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section, is hereby levied on each bale of Upland cotton harvested 
and ginned except cotton consumed by any governmental agency from its 
own production. The supplemental assessment rate shall be levied at the 
rate of five-tenths of one percent of:
    (i) The current value of the cotton multiplied by the number of 
pounds of lint cotton or;
    (ii) The current value of the cotton converted to a fixed amount per 
bale as reflected in the following assessment chart:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Assessment is calculated on \5/10\ of 1 percent of the midpoint of
  each 10 cents increment, based on a 500 lb. bale and converted to a
  fixed amount per bale.

    (2) Each marketing year the collecting handler must select one of 
the two options for collecting the supplemental assessment as provided 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The handler shall notify the Cotton 
Board as to the method selected at the time the handler files the first 
handler report each marketing year.
    (b) Importer assessment. An assessment for cotton research and 
promotion of $1 per bale is hereby levied on each bale of cotton, or the 
bale equivalent thereof for cotton in cotton-containing products 
identified in the HTS conversion factor table in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section and imported into the United States on or after July 31, 
1992. The $1 per bale assessment shall be converted to a fixed amount 
per kilogram to facilitate the U.S. Customs Service in collecting this 
assessment.
    (1) A supplemental assessment for cotton research and promotion in 
addition to the $1 per bale assessment provided for in paragraph (b) of 
this section is hereby levied on each bale of cotton or bale equivalent 
of cotton in cotton-containing products, identified in this subpart, 
imported into the United States on or after July 31, 1992. The 
supplemental assessment shall be levied at the rate of five-tenths of 
one percent of the historical value of cotton as determined by the 
Secretary and expressed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The rate of 
the supplemental assessment on imported cotton will be

[[Page 33]]

the same as that levied on cotton produced within the United States. The 
supplemental assessment will be calculated as a fixed amount per 
kilogram and added to the $1 per bale or bale equivalent assessment to 
facilitate the Customs Service in collecting assessments.
    (2) The 12-month average of monthly average prices received by U.S. 
farmers will be calculated annually. Such average will be used as the 
value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying the supplemental 
assessment on imported cotton and will be expressed in kilograms. The 
value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying this supplemental 
assessment is $1.4881 per kilogram.
    (3) The following table contains Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) 
classification numbers and corresponding conversion factors and 
assessments. The left column of the following table indicates the HTS 
classifications of imported cotton and cotton-containing products 
subject to assessment. The center column indicates the conversion factor 
for determining the raw fiber content for each kilogram of the HTS. HTS 
numbers for raw cotton have no conversion factor in the table. The right 
column indicates the total assessment per kilogram of the article 
assessed.
    (i) Any line item entry of cotton appearing on Customs entry 
documentation in which the value of the cotton contained therein results 
in the calculation of an assessment of two dollars ($2.00) or less will 
not be subject to assessments as described in this section.
    (ii) In the event that any HTS number subject to assessment is 
changed and such change is merely a replacement of a previous number and 
has no impact on the physical properties, description, or cotton content 
of the product involved, assessments will continue to be collected based 
on the new number.

Sec. 1207.320  Establishment and membership.

    (a) There is hereby established a National Potato Promotion Board, 
hereinafter called the ``Board'', composed of producers, importers, and 
a public member appointed by the Secretary. Producer members shall be 
appointed from nominations submitted by producers in the various States 
or groups of States pursuant to Sec. 1207.322. Importer members shall be 
appointed from nominations submitted by importers pursuant to 
Sec. 1207.322. The public member shall be nominated by Board members in 
such manner as recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary, 
and shall be appointed by the Secretary.
    (b) Producer membership upon the Board shall be determined on the 
basis of the potato production reported in the latest Crop Production 
Annual Summary Report issued by the Crop Reporting Board, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. Unless the Secretary, upon recommendation of 
the Board, determines an alternate basis, for each five million 
hundredweight of such production, or major fraction thereof, produced 
within each State, such State shall be entitled to one member. However, 
each State shall initially be entitled to at least one member.
    (c) The number of importer member positions on the Board shall be 
based on the hundredweights of potatoes, potato products equivalent to 
fresh potatoes, and seed potatoes imported into the United States but 
shall not exceed five importer members. Unless the Secretary, upon 
recommendation of the Board, determines an alternate basis, there shall 
be one importer member position for each 5 million hundredweight, or 
major fraction thereof, of potatoes, potato product equivalents, and 
seed potatoes imported into the United States.
    (d) Any State in which the potato producers fail to respond to an 
officially called nomination meeting may be combined with an adjacent 
State for the purpose of representation on the Board, in which case the 
Board's producer member selected by the Secretary will represent both 
States, but

[[Page 48]]

such member's voting power under Sec. 1207.325 shall not be increased.
    (e) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the Board, may establish, 
through rule making procedure, districts or groups of States in order to 
change the representation requirements for membership on the Board. In 
such event the voting power of members under Sec. 1207.325 would be 
based upon the total production within the new district or group of 
States.
    (f) Should the Board fail to nominate a public member, the Secretary 
may appoint such member.

<R05>
Sec. 1207.322  Nominations and appointment.

    The Secretary shall select the producer, importer, and public 
members of the Board from nominations which may be made in the following 
manner.
    (a) A meeting or meetings of producers shall be held in each State 
to nominate producer members for the Board. For nominations to the 
initial Board the meetings shall be announced by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. The Department may call upon other organizations to assist 
in conducting the meetings such as State and national organizations of 
potato producers. Such nomination meetings shall be held not later than 
60 days after the issuance of this subpart. Any organization designated 
to hold such nomination meetings shall give adequate notice of such 
meetings to the potato producers affected; also to the Secretary so that 
a representative of the Secretary, if available, may conduct such 
meetings or act as secretary of such nomination meetings.
    (b) After the establishment of the initial Board, the nominations 
for subsequent Board producer members shall be made by producers at 
meetings in the producing sections or States. The Board shall hold such 
meetings, or cause them to be held, in accordance with rules established 
pursuant to recommendation of the Board.
    (c) Only producers may participate in designating producer nominees. 
Each producer is entitled to one vote only on behalf of himself, his 
partners, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and representatives for each 
position for which nominations are being held. If a producer is engaged 
in producing potatoes in more than one State, he shall elect the State 
in which he shall vote. In no event shall he vote in nominations in more 
than one meeting.
    (d) The importer members shall be nominated by importers of 
potatoes, potato products and/or seed potatoes. The number of importer 
members on the Board shall be announced by the Secretary and shall not 
exceed five members. The Board may call upon organizations of potato, 
potato products and/or seed potato importers to assist in nominating 
importers for membership on the Board. If such organizations fail to 
submit nominees or are determined by the Board to not adequately 
represent importers, then the Board may conduct meetings of importers to 
nominate eligible importers for Board member positions. In determining 
if importer organizations adequately represent importers, the Board 
shall consider:
    (1) How many importers belong to the association;
    (2) What percentage of the total number of importers is represented 
by the association;

[[Page 49]]

    (3) Is the association representative of the potato, potato product, 
and seed potato import industry;
    (4) Does the association speak for potato, potato product, and seed

    (4) No assessments shall be levied on otherwise assessable potatoes 
which are contained in imported products wherein potatoes are not a 
principal ingredient.
    (c) Potatoes and potato products used for nonhuman food purposes, 
other than seed, are exempt from assessment but are subject to the

or potato products.

FR 44036, Aug. 26, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1207.511  Determination of assessable quantity.

    The assessable quantity of potatoes in any lot shall be determined 
on the basis of utilization. Assessments shall be due on the entire lot 
handled for human consumption, seed, or unspecified purposes if there is 
no accounting made on the basis of the utilization of such lot. However, 
if the accounting identifies all or portions of such lot on the basis of 
utilization, assessments shall be due only on that portion utilized for 
human consumption and seed.


<R05>
Sec. 1207.512  Designated handler.

    The assessment on each lot of potatoes produced in the 50 States of 
the United States and handled shall be paid by the designated handler as 
hereafter set forth.
    (a) Unless otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(8), (b), and (c) of 
this section, the designated handler shall be the first handler of such 
potatoes. The first handler is the person who initially performs a 
handler function as heretofore defined. Such person may be a fresh 
shipper, processor, or other person who first places the potatoes in the 
channels of commerce. A producer who grades, packs, or otherwise 
performs handler functions thereby becomes a handler and as such assumes 
first handler responsibilities under this part. The following examples 
are provided to aid in identification of first handlers who are 
designated handlers:
    (1) Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a 
handler for preparation for market. The handler in this instance is the 
designated handler, regardless of whether he subsequently handles such 
potatoes for his own account or for the account of the producer.
    (2) Producer delivers field-run potatoes of his own production to a 
handler who takes title to such potatoes and places them in storage for 
subsequent handling. The handler who purchases such potatoes from the 
producer is the designated handler.
    (3) Producer delivers field-run potatoes to a commercial storage 
facility for the purpose of holding such potatoes under his own account 
for later sale. There is no designated handler in this instance since 
such potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no 
assessment is due. The designated handler of such potatoes would be 
identified on the basis of subsequent handling of such potatoes.
    (4) Fresh shipper purchases a lot of potatoes from a producer, packs 
a portion of such potatoes for fresh market, and delivers the balance to 
a processor. The fresh shipper is the designated handler for all 
potatoes in the lot.
    (5) Handler purchases potatoes from a producer's field or storage 
for the purpose of preparing such potatoes for market or for 
transporting such potatoes to storage for subsequent handling. The 
handler who purchases such potatoes from the producer is the designated 
handler.
    (6) Producer packs and sells potatoes of his own production from the 
field, roadside stand, or storage to a consumer, itinerant trucker, or 
other buyer. In performing such handler functions the producer assumes 
the responsibility of designated handler.
    (7) Processor utilizes potatoes of his own production in the 
manufacture of

[[Page 57]]

potato chips, frozen, dehydrated, or canned products for human 
consumption. In so handling potatoes, the processor assumes the 
responsibility of designated handler.
    (8) Producer utilizes potatoes of his own production for seed in 
planting his subsequent crop. Such seed potatoes do not enter the 
current of commerce; there is no designated handler in this instance 
since the potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and no 
assessment is due. However, seed potatoes sold or shipped to other 
producers for planting or to other persons for subsequent disposition 
enter the current of commerce and are subject to assessment. The 
producer of seed potatoes shall be the designated handler of such 
potatoes shipped to other producers for planting and the assessment is 
due when he first sells or otherwise handles such potatoes. The first 
person who acquires seed potatoes from the producer thereof for 
subsequent disposition other than planting by said person shall be the 
designated handler of such potatoes. However, the seed producer will be 
the designated handler responsible for filing reports and making 
payments, unless he can show that the first person who obtained the 
potatoes from him disposed of them other than by planting. To show this 
the seed producer must submit to the Potato Board the name and address 
of the first person who obtained the potatoes from him and an invoice of 
sale or settlement sheet on which it is indicated that such person will 
be the designated handler and therefore will be responsible for the 
payment of the assessments. Only by showing this is the seed producer no 
longer considered the designated handler and therefore not liable for 
the assessments.
    (b) Any person who handles potatoes for a producer thereof under 
oral or written contract or agreement providing for the sale thereof 
shall be the designated handler for such potatoes, notwithstanding the 
fact that the producer may have graded, packed, or otherwise handled 
such potatoes and thereby became the first handler of such potatoes.
    Examples.  A cooperative marketing association, or other person, who 
makes an accounting to the producer, or pay the proceeds of the sale to 
the producer would be the designated handler responsible for the 
assessment.
    (c) Any processor who purchases potatoes from the producer thereof 
shall be the designated handler even though the producer may have 
graded, packed, or otherwise handled such potatoes and thereby became 
the first handler of such potatoes.

<R05>
Sec. 1207.513  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Time of payment. The assessment on domestically produced 
potatoes shall become due at the time a determination of assessable 
potatoes is made in the normal handling process, pursuant to 
Sec. 1207.511. If no determination is made of the utilization of a lot, 
assessments shall be due on the entire lot when it enters the current of 
commerce. The assessment on imported potatoes, potato products, and seed 
potatoes shall become due at the time of entry, or withdrawal, for 
consumption into the United States.
    (b) Responsibility for payment. (1) The designated handler is 
responsible for payment of the assessment on domestically produced 
potatoes. He may pay with no reimbursement from the producer. In the 
alternative, he may collect the assessment from the producer, or deduct 
such assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer on whose potatoes 
the assessment is made, provided he furnishes the producer with evidence 
of such payment. Any such collection or deduction of assessment shall be 
made not later than the time when the assessment becomes payable by the 
handler to the Board. Failure of the handler to collect or deduct such 
assessment does not relieve the handler of his obligation to remit the 
assessment to the Board.
    (2) The Customs Service shall collect payment of assessment on 
imported potatoes, potato products, and seed potatoes from importers and 
forward such assessment per agreement between the Customs Service and 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Importers shall be responsible for 
payment of assessment

[[Page 58]]

directly to the Board of any assessment due but not collected by the 
Customs Service at the time of entry, or withdrawal, for consumption 
into the United States. An importer may apply to the Board for 
reimbursement of assessments paid on exempted products.
    (c) Payment directly to the Board. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, each designated handler or 
importer shall remit assessments directly to the Board by check, draft, 
or money order payable to the National Potato Promotion Board, or NPPB, 
not later than 10 days after the end of the month such assessment is due 
together with a report (preferably on Board forms) thereon.
    (2) All designated handlers, including a designated handler whose 
own production is handled and assessments to the Board paid by another 
designated handler, shall report to the Board:
    (i) Date of report (which is also date of payment to the Board).
    (ii) The name and address of the designated handler;
    (iii) The period potatoes were handled;
    (iv) The total quantity of potatoes determined to be assessable 
during the period potatoes were handled, pursuant to Sec. 1207.511.
    (3) Designated handlers who collect assessments from producers or 
withhold assessments from their accounts or pay the assessment 
themselves shall also include a list of all such producers whose 
potatoes were handled during the period, their addresses and the total 
assessable quantities handled for each such producer.
    (i) In lieu of such a list, the designated handler may substitute 
authentic copies of settlement sheets given to each producer provided 
such settlement sheets contain all the information listed above.
    (ii) The words ``final report'' shall be shown on the last report at 
the close of his marketing season or at the end of each fiscal period if 
such handler markets potatoes on a year-round basis.
    (4) Prepayment of assessment: (i) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
and reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Board 
may permit designated handlers to make advance payments of their total 
estimated assessments for the season to the Board prior to their actual 
determination of assessable potatoes. Such procedure may be permitted 
when it is considered by the designated handler to be the more practical 
method of payment.
    (ii) Persons using such procedure shall provide a final annual 
accounting of actual handling and assessments.
    (iii) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board upon request.
    (d) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may authorize 
other organizations to collect assessments in its behalf. In any State 
or area in which the Board has negotiated an agreement to collect 
assessments with an agency such as a State Potato Commission or a Potato 
Association approved by the Secretary, the designated handler shall pay 
the assessment to such agency in the time and manner, and with such 
identifying information as specified in such agreement. Such an 
agreement shall not provide any cooperating agency with authority to 
collect confidential information from handlers; to qualify, the 
cooperating agency must on its own accord have access to all information 
required by the Board for collection purposes. If the Board requires 
further evidence of payment than provided, it may acquire such evidence 
from individual designated handlers.
    (1) All such agreements are subject to the requirement of 
Sec. 1207.352 Confidential treatment, of the plan, the provisions of 
section 310(c) of the Act, and all applicable rules and regulations and 
financial safeguards in effect under the Act and the plan; and all 
affected persons shall agree to, and conduct their operations and 
activities in accordance with, such requirements.

the Council for advertising, promotion, dissemination of information, 
and research. All such submissions to the Secretary shall be accompanied 
by a proposed budget showing the estimated expense to be incurred and 
the availability of revenue from which such expense may be paid. On 
approval of any such submission, the Council may proceed with the 
contract, plan or project and incur the expenses necessary to carry it 
out. Contracts or agreements to be submitted to the Secretary and 
entered into if approved by the Secretary shall, among such other 
matters as may be required, provide that:

[[Page 70]]

    (1) The contracting or agreeing party shall develop and submit to 
the Council a plan or project, together with a budget that includes the 
estimated costs to be incurred for the plan or project;
    (2) The plan or project shall become effective on the approval of 
the Secretary; and
    (3) The contracting or agreeing party shall:
    (i) Keep accurate records of all of the transactions of the party;
    (ii) Account for funds received and expenses;
    (iii) Make periodic reports to the Council of activities conducted; 
and
    (iv) Make such other reports as the Council or the Secretary may 
require.
    (d) The Council, from time to time, may seek advice from and consult 
with experts from the production, import, wholesale, and retail segments 
of the cut flowers and greens industry to assist in the development of 
promotion, consumer information, and related research plans and 
projects. For these purposes, the Council may appoint special committees 
composed of persons other than Council members. A committee so appointed 
may not provide advice or recommendations to a representative of an 
agency, or an officer, of the Federal Government, and shall consult 
directly with the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.43  Other contracts and agreements.

    The Council may enter into contracts or agreements for 
administrative services, including contracts of employment, as may be 
required to conduct its business in accordance with such fiscal period 
budgets as may have been approved by the Secretary. To the extent 
appropriate to the contract involved, contracts entered into by the 
Council under the authority of this section shall contain provisions 
comparable to those described in Sec. 1208.42(c).

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1208.50  Assessments.

    (a) Each qualified handler, as defined in Sec. 1208.16, shall pay to 
the Council an assessment in an amount determined in accordance with 
this subpart, on each sale of cut flowers and greens to a retailer or an 
exempt handler (as defined in Sec. 1208.8) and on each non-sale transfer 
of cut flowers and greens to a retailer by a qualified handler that is a 
distribution center; as well as each direct sale of cut flowers and 
greens to a consumer by a producer that is a qualified handler, or by an 
importer that is a qualified handler. Such assessments shall be remitted 
by each qualified handler to the Council or its agent within 60 days 
after the end of the month in which the sale or non-sale transfer 
subject to assessment under this subpart took place. Such assessments 
shall be paid at the following rates:
    (1) During the first three years after December 29, 1994.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the 
rate shall be one-half of 1 (0.5) percent of the gross sales price of 
the cut flowers and greens sold;
    (ii) In the case of non-sale transfers to a retailer by a qualified 
handler that is a distribution center and in the case of direct sales by 
importers or producers, the rate shall be one-half of 1 (0.5) percent of 
the amount of each transaction's valuation for assessment as provided in 
paragraph (b);
    (2) After the first three years from December 29, 1994, the uniform 
assessment rate may be increased or decreased annually by not more than 
one-quarter of 1 (0.25) percent of the gross sales price of a product 
sold; or in the case of other transactions the amount of such 
transactions, except that the assessment rate may not exceed 1 percent 
of the gross sales price or the transaction amount. Changes in the rate 
of assessment may only be made if such changes are adopted by a two-
thirds majority vote of the Council and approved by the Secretary (after 
public notice and opportunity for comment as provided in the Act) as 
being necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act. Any such change 
so approved by the Secretary may be put into effect without a referendum 
but shall be announced not less than 30 days prior to the beginning of a 
fiscal year.
    (b) Each non-sale transfer of cut flowers and greens to a retailer 
from a qualified handler that is a distribution center shall be treated 
as a sale of cut

[[Page 71]]

flowers and greens to a retailer and shall be assessable. Each direct 
sale of cut flowers and greens to a consumer by a producer who is a 
qualified handler or an importer who is a qualified handler shall be 
assessable. These transactions shall be determined to have the following 
valuations for assessment purposes:
    (1) In the case of a non-sale transfer of cut flowers and greens 
from a distribution center that is a qualified handler and each direct 
sale of cut flowers and greens to a consumer by an importer that is a 
qualified handler, the amount of the valuation of the cut flowers and 
greens for assessment purposes shall be the price paid by the 
distribution center or importer to acquire the cut flowers and greens, 
and determined by multiplying the acquisition price by a uniform factor 
of 1.43 to represent the markup of a wholesale handler on a sale to a 
retailer.
    (2) In the case of a direct sale to a consumer by a producer who is 
a qualified handler, the valuation of the cut flowers and greens for 
assessment purposes shall be equal to an amount determined by 
multiplying the price paid by the consumer by a uniform factor of 0.50 
to represent the cost of producing the article and the markup of a 
wholesale handler on a sale to a retailer.
    (3) The Council may consider and adopt changes in the uniform 
factors specified in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section. Any 
such change shall not become effective until it has been adopted by a 
majority vote of the Council and approved by the Secretary after public 
notice and opportunity to comment on such change as provided in the Act. 
Changes so adopted and approved shall become effective at the beginning 
of the next fiscal year.
    (c) The collection of assessments shall commence on or after a date 
established by the Secretary, and shall continue until terminated by the 
Secretary. If the Council is not constituted on the date the first 
assessments are to be remitted, the Secretary shall have the authority 
to receive assessments on behalf of the Council and may hold such 
assessments in an interest bearing account until the Council is 
constituted, and the funds may be transferred to the Council.
    (d) Assessments shall be determined on the basis of the gross sales 
price. The Council, with the approval of the Secretary, may make uniform 
adjustments in determining the gross sales price when such adjustments 
reflect changes in trade practices or ensure equitable treatment of all 
qualified handlers paying assessments.
    (e) No assessments may be levied on any sale of cut flowers and 
greens for export from the United States. The Council is authorized to 
establish procedures for the verification of exports.
    (f) In general, assessment funds (less refunds, if any) shall be 
used:
    (1) For payment of costs incurred in implementing and administering 
this subpart;
    (2) To provide for a reasonable reserve to be maintained from 
assessments to be available for contingencies; and
    (3) To cover the administrative costs incurred by the Secretary in 
implementing and administering this Act.

    Note to Sec. 1208.50: The requirement to pay assessments is 
terminated as of July 29, 1997.

<R05>
Sec. 1208.51  Influencing governmental action.

    No funds collected by the Council shall in any manner be used for 
the purpose of influencing legislation or government action or policy, 
except to develop and recommend to the Secretary amendments to this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.52  Charges for late payments.

    Any assessment due the Council pursuant to Sec. 1208.50 that is not 
paid on time shall be increased 1.5 percent each month it remains unpaid 
beginning with the day following the date such assessment was due. If 
not paid in full, any remaining amount due, which shall include any 
unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be 
increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of each month 
thereafter until paid. For the purpose of this section, any assessment 
that was determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart 
because of a failure to submit a report when due

[[Page 72]]

shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been 
due if the report had been filed when due. The timeliness of a payment 
to the Council shall be based on the applicable postmark date or the 
date actually received by the Council, whichever is earlier.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.53  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever the Council or the Secretary determines through an audit of 
a person's reports, records, books, or accounts or through some other 
means that additional money is due the Council or that money is due such 
person from the Council, such person shall be notified of the amount 
due. The person shall then remit any amount due the Council by the next 
date for remitting assessments. Overpayments shall be credited to the 
account of the person remitting the overpayment and shall be applied 
against amounts due in succeeding months.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.54  Refunds of assessments and escrow account.

    (a) Any qualified handler may demand and receive from the escrow 
account, subject to the limitation on such payments provided in 
paragraph (c), a one-time refund of any assessments paid by or on behalf 
of the handler if the handler requests the refund before the initial 
referendum on this subpart is held and this subpart is rejected by the 
voters when it is submitted to the referendum. Such a refund will be 
paid only if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The handler has paid the assessments sought to be refunded and 
has submitted proof of such payment;
    (2) The handler does not support the program established under this 
subpart and so states in the handler's demand for a refund;
    (3) The handler's demand for a refund is made on a form specified by 
the Council and filed not less than 10 days prior to the date when the 
initial referendum, conducted pursuant to Sec. 1208.60(a) to ascertain 
whether this subpart shall remain in effect, is scheduled to begin; and
    (4) This subpart is not approved by a simple majority of the votes 
cast by qualified handlers in the initial referendum.
    (b) The Council shall establish an escrow account to be used for 
assessment refunds, as needed, and shall place into the account an 
amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of assessments collected 
during the period beginning on December 29, 1994 and ending on the date 
the results of the initial referendum are issued and the initial 
referendum is completed.
    (c) If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to refund 
the total amount of assessments demanded by all qualified handlers 
determined eligible for refunds and this subpart is not approved in the 
referendum, the Council shall prorate the amount of all such refunds 
among all eligible qualified handlers that demand the refund. If there 
is any amount in excess of the amount needed to pay refunds and 
expenses, it shall be returned pro rata to those who paid assessments. 
If this subpart is approved in the referendum, there shall be no refunds 
made, and all funds in the escrow account shall be returned to the 
Council for use by the Council in accordance with the other provisions 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.55  Postponement of collections.

    (a) The Council may grant a postponement of the payment of an 
assessment under this subpart for any qualified handler that establishes 
that it is financially unable to make the payment. In order that a 
qualified handler that is financially unable to pay an assessment may 
have the opportunity to petition the Council to postpone payment of such 
an assessment, as provided in the Act, the Council shall develop forms 
and procedures for this purpose as expeditiously as possible and submit 
them to the Secretary for approval and issuance after notice and an 
opportunity for public comment thereon. Such procedures shall, among 
other things, require that the handler demonstrate the handler's 
inability to pay through the submission of an opinion prepared by an 
independent certified public accountant (at the handler's expense) and 
any other documentation specified therein to the effect that the handler 
is insolvent or will be unable to continue to operate if

[[Page 73]]

the handler is required to pay the assessment when due.
    (b) The procedures for obtaining a postponement of payment to be 
developed by the Council for submission to the Secretary shall also 
include provisions with respect to the period of postponement, the 
conditions of payment that may be imposed and the basis, if any, on 
which further extensions of the time for payment will be granted so as 
to appropriately reflect the demonstrated needs of the qualified 
handler.


<R05>
Sec. 1208.56  Determinations.

    (a) The Council is authorized to make the determinations required by 
this subpart as to the status of persons as qualified handlers and 
exempt handlers including determinations of the status of persons as 
qualified wholesale handlers, distribution centers that are qualified 
handlers, producers that are qualified handlers, importers that are 
qualified handlers, as well as such other determinations of status and 
facts as may be required for the effective administration of this 
subpart. Based on such determinations, the Council from time to time 
shall publish lists of exempt handlers who are not required to pay 
assessments, and lists of qualified handlers who are required to pay 
assessments under this subpart.
    (b) For the purpose of applying the $750,000 annual sales limitation 
to a specific person in order to determine the status of the person as a 
qualified handler or an exempt handler or to a specific facility in 
order to determine the status of the facility as an eligible separate 
facility for the purpose of referenda, the Council is authorized to 
determine the annual sales volume of a person or facility.
    (c) Any such determination shall be based on the sales of cut 
flowers and greens by the person or facility during the most recently-
completed calendar year, except that in the case of a new business or 
other operation for which complete data on sales during all or part of 
the most recently-completed calendar year are not available to the 
Council, the determination may be made using an alternative time period 
or other alternative procedures as the Council may find appropriate. In 
making such determinations, the Council is authorized to make 
attributions in accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this 
section and for the purpose of determining the annual sales volume of a 
person or a separate facility of a person, sales attributable to a 
person shall include:
    (1) In the case of an individual, sales attributable to the spouse, 
children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents of the person;
    (2) In the case of a partnership or member of a partnership, sales 
attributable to the partnership and other partners of the partnership;
    (3) In the case of an individual or a partnership, sales 
attributable to any corporation or other entity in which the individual 
or partnership owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity 
is not a corporation) that the individual or partnership controls; and
    (4) In the case of a corporation, sales attributable to any 
corporate subsidiary or other corporation or entity in which the 
corporation owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity is 
not a corporation) that the corporation controls.
    (d) The Council is also authorized to attribute any stock ownership 
interest as may be required to carry out this subpart. In doing so a 
stock ownership interest in the entity that is owned by the spouse, 
children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, or partners of an 
individual, or by a partnership in which a person is a partner, or by a 
corporation more than 50 percent of the stock of which is owned by a 
person, shall be treated as owned by the individual or person.
    (e) For the purpose of this subpart, the Council, with the approval 
of the Secretary, may require a person who sells cut flowers and greens 
to retailers to submit reports to the Council on annual sales by the 
person and on stock ownership.

                        Suspension or Termination


<R05>
Sec. 1208.60  Suspension and termination.

    If the Secretary finds that this subpart, or any provision of this

the policy of the Act, the Secretary shall terminate or suspend the 
operation of this subpart or the provision of this subpart under such 
terms as the Secretary determines are appropriate. Such termination or 
suspension shall not be considered an order within the meaning of such 
term in the Act.

referendum results are issued.
    (4) From time to time account for all receipts and disbursements, 
and deliver all property on hand, together with all books and records of 
the Council and of the trustees, to such persons as the Secretary may

other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such persons full 
title and right to all of the funds, property, and claims vested in the 
Council or the trustees under this subpart.
    (c) Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been 
transferred or delivered under this subpart shall be subject to the same

    (b) The Council shall, as soon as practicable after December 29, 
1994 and after consultation with the Secretary and other appropriate

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1208.150  Procedures for postponement of collections.

    (a) For a request for postponement of the payment of assessments to 
be granted, the qualified handler requesting such postponement must: 
Submit a written opinion from a Certified Public Accountant stating that 
the handler making the request is insolvent or will be unable to 
continue to operate if the handler is required to pay the assessments 
when due; and submit copies of the handler's last three (3) years' 
federal tax returns. The request must be in writing no later than 30 
days after the assessment for the first month of the requested 
postponement period is due. Applications postmarked after the 30-day due 
date will not be considered by the Council. The qualified handler must 
file handler reports with the Council for each month during the 
postponement period. The postponement period may not exceed six (6) 
months unless an extension is requested and granted by the Council. Only 
one extension of up to six (6) months may be granted. Within the 
postponement period, the qualified handler will be exempt from paying 
assessments beginning with the first month for which the request for 
postponement is filed with the Council and for no more than six (6) 
months unless an extension is granted. The same procedures used for the 
initial request will be used to grant any extension. The written request 
must specify:
    (1) A reason for the request;
    (2) Detailed information concerning the qualified handler's name, 
address, and telephone and fax numbers;
    (3) The month(s) for which the request is made;
    (4) Assessments due per month or gross sales per month;
    (5) Total assessments due;
    (6) The percent or amount of the outstanding assessment to be paid 
each month after the postponement of payment is granted; and
    (7) The starting and ending date for the payment of assessments due.
    (b) At the end of the postponement period, the qualified handler 
must pay the percent or amount outstanding of assessments agreed upon 
each month

[[Page 77]]

as well as any other assessments which are due. An extension of time for 
payment of postponed assessments, if granted, will be for the same 
months previously requested and granted. The extension must not exceed 
six (6) months. If a qualified handler requests that another period be 
postponed, that handler must file another application for the 
postponement of the assessment for the second period using the same 
procedure which was followed in requesting the first postponement. A 
qualified handler may request the postponement of the payment of 
assessments for a maximum of two periods of up to six (6) months each. 
The payment applicable to the second postponement period, if granted, 
may not be extended, and the payment period must not exceed the length 
of the postponement period. Payment of the total assessments due, when 
an extension and a second period are granted, must begin within one (1) 
year after the first postponed month's assessments were originally due. 
No additional postponements would be considered by the Council until the 
assessments owed for the first two periods have been paid. The Council 
may conduct an audit of the qualified handler's records at any time to 
determine whether the qualified handler will be unable to continue to 
operate if the handler is required to pay the assessments due. In the 
event that postponed assessments are not paid when due, the Council can 
demand that all such assessments due be paid in their entirety.
    (c) Charges for late payment of assessments as described in 
Sec. 1208.52 will not be imposed on assessments for which postponement

and the number of Council members from each region shall be as follows:
    (1) Region 1: including Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, 
Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, 
Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, and

    (4) Region 4: including New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, 
Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina,

    (c) Importers shall be represented by a single, separate region, 
referred to as Region 5, consisting of the United States as defined in 
Sec. 1209.21(b) when imports, on average, equal or exceed 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (d) At least every five years, and not more than every three years, 
the Council shall review changes in the geographic distribution of 
mushroom production volume throughout the United States and import 
volume, using the average annual mushroom production and imports over 
the preceding four years, and, based on such review, shall recommend to 
the Secretary reapportionment of the regions established in paragraph 
(b), or modification of the number of members from such regions, as 
determined under the rules established in paragraph (e), or both, as 
necessary to best reflect the geographic distribution of mushroom 
production volume in the United States and representation of imports, if 
applicable.
    (e) Subject to the nine-member maximum limitation, the following 
procedure will be used to determine the number of members for each 
region to serve on the Council under paragraph (d):
    (1) Each region that produces, on average, at least 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually shall be entitled to one representative on 
the Council.
    (2) As provided in paragraph (c), importers shall be represented by 
a single, separate region, which shall be entitled to one 
representative, if such region imports, on average, at least 35,000,000 
pounds of mushrooms annually.
    (3) Each region shall be entitled to representation by an additional 
Council member for each 50,000,000 pounds of annual production or 
imports, on average, in excess of the initial 35,000,000 pounds required 
to qualify the region for representation.
    (4) Should, in the aggregate, regions be entitled to levels of 
representation under paragraphs (e) (1), (2) and (3) that would exceed 
the nine-member limit on the Council under the Act, the regions shall be 
entitled to representation on the Council as follows:
    (i) Each region first shall be assigned one representative on the 
Council pursuant to paragraphs (e) (1) and (2).
    (ii) Then, each region with 50,000,000 pounds of annual production 
or imports, on average, in excess of the initial 35,000,000 pounds 
required to qualify the region for representation shall be assigned one 
additional representative on the Council, except that if under such 
assignments all five regions, counting importers as a region, if 
applicable, would be entitled to additional representatives, that region 
with the smallest on-average volume, in terms of production or imports, 
will not be assigned an additional representative.
    (iii) After members are assigned to regions under paragraphs (e)(4) 
(i) and (ii), if less than the entire nine seats on the Council have 
been assigned to regions, the remaining seats on the Council shall be 
assigned to each region for each 50,000,000 pound increment of annual 
production or import volume, on average, in excess of 85,000,000 pounds 
until all the seats are filled. It for any such 50,000,000 pound 
increment, more regions are eligible for seats than there are seats 
available, the seat or seats assigned for such increment shall be 
assigned to that region or those regions with greater on-average 
production or import volume than the other regions otherwise eligible at 
that increment level.
    (f) In determining the volume of mushrooms produced in the United 
States or imported into the United States for purposes of this section, 
the Council and the Secretary shall:
    (1) Only consider mushrooms produced or imported by producers and 
importers, respectively, as those terms are defined in Secs.  1209.8 and 
1209.15; and
    (2) Use the information received by the Council under Sec. 1209.60, 
and data published by the Department.

    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e), nominations for each 
position shall be made by regional caucus in the region entitled to 
nominate for such position. Notice of such caucus shall be publicized to 
all producers or importers within the region, and to the Secretary, at

the call for nominations from the Council and the Department's equal 
opportunity policy. Except with respect to nominations for the initial 
appointments to the Council, the responsibility for convening and 
publicizing the regional caucus shall be that of the Council.
    (2) All producers or importers within the region may participate in 
the caucus. However, if a producer is engaged in the production of 
mushrooms in more than one region or is also an importer, such person's 
participation within a region shall be limited to one vote and shall 
only reflect the volume of such person's production or imports within 
the applicable region.
    (3) The regional caucus shall conduct the selection process for the 
nominees in accordance with procedures to be adopted at the caucus 
subject to the following requirements:
    (i) There shall be two individuals nominated for each open position.
    (ii) Each nominee shall meet the qualifications set forth in the 
call.
    (iii) If a producer nominee is engaged in the production of 
mushrooms in more than one region or is also an importer, such 
individual shall participate within the region that such individual so 
elects in writing to the Council and such election shall remain 
controlling until revoked in writing to the Council.
    (e) After the regional caucuses for the initial Council, the Council 
may conduct the selection of nominees by mail ballot in lieu of a 
regional caucus.
    (f) When producers or importers are voting for nominees to the 
Council, whether through a regional caucus or a mail ballot, the 
following conditions shall apply:
    (1) Voting for any open position shall be on the basis of:
    (i) One vote per eligible voter; and

[[Page 82]]

    (ii) Volume of on-average production or imports of the eligible 
voter within that region.
    (2) Whenever the producers or importers in a region are choosing 
nominees for one open position on the Council, the proposed nominee with 
the highest number of votes cast and the proposed nominee with the 
highest volume of production or importers voted shall be the nominees 
submitted to the Secretary. If a proposed nominee receives both the 
highest number of votes cast and the highest volume of production or 
imports voted, then the proposed nominee with the second highest number 
of votes cast shall be a nominee submitted to the Secretary along with 
such proposed nominee receiving both the highest number of votes cast 
and the highest volume of production or imports voted.
    (3) Whenever the producers or importers in a region are choosing 
nominees for more than one open position on the Council at the same 
time, the number of the nominations submitted to the Secretary shall 
equal twice the number of such open positions, and for each open 
position shall consist of the proposed nominee with the highest number 
of votes cast and the proposed nominee with the highest volume of 
production or imports voted with respect to that position, subject to 
the rule set out in paragraph (f)(2). An individual shall only be 
nominated for one such open position.
    (4) Voters shall certify on their ballots as to their on-average 
production or import volume within the region involved. Such 
certification may be subject to verification.
    (g)(1) The Secretary may reject any nominee submitted. If there are 
insufficient nominees from which to appoint members to the Council as a 
result of the Secretary's rejecting such nominees, additional nominees 
shall be submitted to the Secretary under the procedures set out in this 
section.
    (2) Whenever producers or importers in a region cannot agree on 
nominees for an open position on the Council under the preceding 
provisions of this section, or whenever they fail to nominate 
individuals for appointment to the Council, the Secretary may appoint 
members in such manner as the Secretary, by regulation, determines 
appropriate.

qualify by filing a written acceptance with the Secretary at the time of 
nomination.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.33  Appointment.

    From the nominations made pursuant to Sec. 1209.31, the Secretary 
shall appoint the members of the Council on the basis of representation 
provided for in Sec. 1209.30, except that no more than one member may be 
appointed to the Council from nominations submitted by any one producer 
or importer.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.34  Term of office.

    (a) The members of the Council shall serve for terms of three years,

    (b) Members of the initial Council shall be designated for, and 
shall serve, terms as follows: One producer member each from regions 1,

member each from regions 1, 2, and 3 shall be appointed for an initial 
term of two years; and one producer member each from regions 2, 3, and 4 
shall be appointed for an initial term of three years. Because current 
imports of fresh mushrooms are less than 35,000,000 pounds, the minimum 
established for representation on the Council, importers will not 
initially have a member appointed to the Council.
    (c)(1) Except with respect to terms of office of the initial 
Council, the term of office for each member of the Council shall begin 
on January 1 or such other date that may be approved by the Secretary.
    (2) The term of office for the initial Council shall begin 
immediately following appointment by the Secretary, except that time in 
the interim period from appointment until the following January 1, or 
such other date that is the generally applicable beginning date for 
terms under paragraph (c)(1) approved by the Secretary, shall not count 
toward the initial term of office.

[[Page 83]]

they are appointed and have qualified, and until their successors are 
appointed and have qualified.
    (e)(1) No member shall serve more than two successive three-year 
terms, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii).
    (2)(i) Those members serving initial terms of two or three years may 
serve one successive three-year term.

    (a) To fill any vacancy occasioned by the death, removal, 
resignation, or disqualification of any member of the Council, the 
Secretary may appoint a successor from the most recent nominations 
submitted for open positions on the Council assigned to the region that 
the vacant position represents, or the Secretary may obtain nominees to 
fill such vacancy in such manner as the Secretary, by regulation, deems 
appropriate. Each such successor appointment shall be for the remainder 
of the term vacated. A vacancy will not be required to be filled if the 
unexpired term is less than six months.

successive three-year term.
    (ii) Any successor serving one year or less may serve two successive 
three-year terms.

duties of a member of the Council, or if a member of the Council is 
known to be engaged in acts of dishonesty or willful misconduct, the 
Council may recommend to the Secretary that the member be removed from 
office. If the Secretary finds the recommendation of the Council shows 
adequate cause, the Secretary shall remove such member from office. 
Further, without recommendation of the Council, a member may be removed 
by the Secretary upon showing of adequate cause, including the failure 
by a member to submit reports or remit assessments required under this 
part, if the Secretary determines that such member's continued service

Sec. 1209.40  Programs, plans, and projects.

    (a) The Council shall receive and evaluate, or on its own initiative 
develop, and submit to the Secretary for approval any program, plan, or 
project authorized under this subpart. Such programs, plans, or projects 
shall provide for:
    (1) The establishment, issuance, effectuation, and administration of 
appropriate programs for promotion, research, consumer information, and 
industry information with respect to mushrooms; and
    (2) The establishment and conduct of research with respect to the

products, and the creation of new products thereof, to the end that 
marketing and use of mushrooms may be encouraged, expanded, improved or 
made more acceptable. However, as prescribed by the Act, nothing in this 
subpart may be construed to authorize mandatory requirements for quality 
control, grade standards, supply management programs, or other programs 
that would control production or otherwise limit the right of individual 
producers to produce mushrooms.
    (b) No program, plan, or project shall be implemented prior to its 
approval by the Secretary. Once a program, plan, or project is so 
approved, the

[[Page 86]]

Council shall take appropriate steps to implement it.
    (c) Each programs, plan, or project implemented under this subpart 
shall be reviewed or evaluated periodically by the Council to ensure 
that it contributes to an effective program of promotion, research, 
consumer information, or industry information. If it is found by the

an effective program of promotion, research, consumer information, or 
industry information, then the Council shall terminate such program, 
plan, or project.
    (d) In carrying out any program, plan, or project, no reference to a 
brand name, trade name, or State or regional identification of any 
mushrooms or mushroom product shall be made. In addition, no program, 
plan, or project shall make use of unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
with respect to the quality, value, or use of any competing product.

<R05>
Sec. 1209.50  Budget and expenses.

    (a)(1) At least 60 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year,

forth in paragraph (f). The Council may change such rate at any time, as 
provided in Sec. 1209.51(b)(5).

approved budget and which are consistent with governing bylaws need not 
have prior approval by the Secretary.
    (b) The Council is authorized to incur such expenses, including 
provision for a reasonable reserve, as the Secretary finds are

shall be paid from funds received by the Council.
    (c) The Council shall not use funds collected or received under this 
subpart to reimburse, defray, or make payment of expenditures incurred 
in developing, drafting, studying, lobbying on or promoting the 
legislation authorizing this subpart. Such prohibition includes 
reimbursement, defrayment, or payment to mushroom industry associations 
or organizations, producers or importers, lawyers, law firms, or 
consultants.

only be used to pay expenses incurred in the conduct of programs, plans, 
and projects. Such contributions shall be free from any encumbrance by 
the donor and the Council shall retain complete control of their use. 
The donor may recommend that the whole or a portion of the contribution 
be applied to an ongoing program, plan, or project.

carry over to subsequent fiscal periods excess funds in any reserve so 
established, except that the funds in the reserve shall not exceed 
approximately

one fiscal year's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used to defray any 
expenses authorized under this subpart.

for the payment of administrative expenses, subject to the same fiscal, 
budget, and audit controls as other funds of the Council.

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1209.251  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Each first handler responsible for collecting assessments on 
domestic mushrooms shall collect the amounts assessed and remit such 
amounts to the Council on a monthly basis not later than the fifteenth 
day of the month following the month in which the mushrooms were 
marketed to or through the first handler.
    (b) Each producer responsible for paying any assessment amount on 
the producer's own mushrooms shall remit such amount to the Council on a 
monthly basis not later than the fifteenth day of the month following 
the month in which the mushrooms were marketed by the producer.
    (c) Each importer shall be responsible for remittance to the Council 
of any assessment amount not collected by the U.S. Customs Service at 
the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the United States. 
Any such assessment amount shall be remitted to the Council on a monthly 
basis not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the month 
of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the United States. Any 
person who imports mushrooms, as principal or as an agent, broker, or 
consignee for any person who produces mushrooms outside the United 
States for marketing in the United States shall be considered an 
importer.
    (d) Remittance shall be by check, draft, or money order payable to 
the Mushroom Council, and shall be accompanied by a report, on a form 
provided by the Council.
    (e) A late payment charge shall be imposed on any first handler or 
importer who fails to make timely remittance to the Council of the total 
assessment amount for which the person is liable. Such late payment 
charge shall be imposed on any assessments not received by the last day 
of the month following the month in which the mushrooms involved were 
marketed or, in the case of imports, not collected by the U.S. Customs 
Service at the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the 
United States. This one-time late payment charge shall be 10 percent of 
the assessments due before interest charges have accrued. The late 
payment charge will not be applied to any late payments postmarked 
within 15 days after the end of the month such assessments are due.
    (f) In addition to the late payment charge, interest shall be 
charged at a rate of one and one-half percent per month on the 
outstanding balance, including the late payment charge and any accrued 
interest, of any account that remains delinquent beyond the last day of 
the second month following the month the mushrooms involved were 
marketed. However, first handlers paying their assessments, in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, will not be subject to 
the one and one-half percent per month interest under this paragraph 
until the last day of the second month after such assessments are due 
under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. In the case of imports, such a 
rate of interest will be charged to any account that remains delinquent 
on any assessments not collected by the U.S. Customs Service at the time 
of entry or withdrawal for consumption into the United States. Such a 
rate of interest will continue to be charged monthly until the 
outstanding balance is paid to the Council.
    (g) Any assessment determined by the Council at a date later than 
prescribed by this section, because of a person's failure to submit a 
report to the Council when due, shall be considered to have been payable 
by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed on time. 
A late payment charge and monthly interest charges on the outstanding 
balance shall be applicable to such unpaid assessment in accordance with 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
    (h) In lieu of the monthly assessment payment and reporting 
requirements of Sec. 1209.260 of this subpart and Sec. 1209.60 of this 
part, the Council may permit a first handler to make advance payment of 
the total estimated assessment amount due to the Council for the ensuing 
fiscal year, or portion thereof, prior to the actual determination of 
assessable mushrooms.

[[Page 94]]

    (1) Each person shall provide an initial report estimating 
assessable mushrooms. The Council may request additional information on 
such estimate.
    (2) Each person shall provide a final report of actual marketings 
during the period involved and remit any unpaid assessments not later 
than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the period 
covered.
    (3) Any person whose prepayment exceeds the amount paid shall be 
reimbursed for the amount of overpayment. The Council shall not, in any 
case, be obligated to pay interest on any advance payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.252  Exemption procedures.

    (a) Any person who produces or imports, on average, 500,000 pounds 
or less of mushrooms annually and who desires to claim an exemption from 
assessments during a fiscal year as provided in Sec. 1209.52 of this 
part shall apply to the Council, on a form provided by the Council, for 
a certificate of exemption. Such persons shall certify that their 
production or importation of mushrooms shall not exceed 500,000 pounds, 
on average, for the fiscal year for which the exemption is claimed. 
Pursuant to this section, the term on average shall be calculated by 
averaging a person's estimated production or importation for the fiscal 
year for which an exemption is claimed with such person's production or 
importation in the preceding fiscal year.
    (b) On receipt of an application, the Council shall determine 
whether an exemption may be granted. The Council then will issue, if 
deemed appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person that is 
eligible to receive one. Each person who is exempt from assessment must 
provide an exemption number to the first handler in order not to be 
subject to collection of an assessment on mushrooms. First handlers and 
importers, except as otherwise authorized by the Council, shall maintain 
records showing the exemptee's name and address along with the exemption 
number assigned by the Council. Importers who are exempt from assessment 
shall be eligible for reimbursement of assessments collected by the U.S. 
Customs Service and shall apply to the Council for reimbursement of such 
assessments paid.
    (c) Any person who desires to renew the exemption from assessments 
for a subsequent fiscal year shall reapply to the Council, on a form 
provided by the Council, for a certificate of exemption.
    (d) The Council may require persons receiving an exemption from 
assessments to provide to the Council reports on the disposition of 
exempt mushrooms.

                                 Reports


<R05>
Sec. 1209.260  Reports.

    Each first handler shall be required to report monthly to the 
Council such information as may be required under Sec. 1209.60(a) of 
this part. In addition, each first handler shall be required to provide 
the tax identification number or social security number of each producer 
the first handler has dealt with during the time period covered by the 
report.

      Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Order

    Source: 62 FR 66975, Dec. 23, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.300  General.

    A referendum to determine whether eligible producers and importers 
favor continuation of the Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer 
Information Order shall be conducted in accordance with these 
procedures.

[[Page 95]]


<R05>
Sec. 1209.301  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise defined below, the definition of terms used in 
these procedures shall have the same meaning as the definitions in the 
Order.
    (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Agricultural 
Marketing Service, with power to redelegate, or any officer or employee 
of the Department to whom authority has been delegated or may hereafter 
be delegated to act in the Administrator's stead.
    (b) Order means the Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer 
Information Order, including an amendment to the Order.
    (c) Referendum agent or agent means the individual or individuals 
designated by the Secretary to conduct the referendum.
    (d) Representative period means the period designated by the 
Secretary.
    (e) Person means any individual, group of individuals, partnership, 
corporation, association, cooperative, or any other legal entity. For 
the purpose of this definition, the term ``partnership'' includes, but 
is not limited to:
    (1) A husband and wife who have title to, or leasehold interest in, 
mushroom production facilities and equipment as tenants in common, joint 
tenants, tenants by the entirety, or, under community property laws, as 
community property, and
    (2) So-called ``joint ventures'', wherein one or more parties to the 
agreement, informal or otherwise, contributed capital and others 
contributed labor, management, equipment, or other services, or any 
variation of such contributions by two or more parties so that it 
results in the production or importation of fresh mushrooms and the 
authority to transfer title to the mushrooms so produced or imported.
    (f) Eligible producer means any person or entity defined as a 
producer who produces, on average, over 500,000 pounds annually of fresh 
mushrooms during the representative period and who:
    (1) Owns or shares in the ownership of mushroom production 
facilities and equipment resulting in the ownership of the mushrooms 
produced;
    (2) Rents mushroom production facilities and equipment resulting in 
the ownership of all or a portion of the mushrooms produced;

manage them and, as compensation, obtains the ownership of a portion of 
the mushrooms produced; or
    (4) Is a party in a landlord-tenant relationship or a divided 
ownership arrangement involving totally independent entities cooperating 
only to produce mushrooms who share the risk of loss and receive a share 
of the mushrooms produced. No other acquisition of legal title to 
mushrooms shall be deemed to result in persons becoming eligible 
producers.
    (g) Eligible importer means any person or entity defined as an 
importer who imports, on average, over 500,000 pounds annually of fresh 
mushrooms during the representative period. Importation occurs when

States. Included are persons who hold title to foreign-produced 
mushrooms immediately upon release by the U.S. Customs Service, as well

cooperating only to produce mushrooms, in which more than one of the 
parties is a producer, shall be entitled to cast one ballot in the 
referendum covering only such producer's share of the ownership.
    (b) Proxy voting is not authorized, but an officer or employee of an 
eligible corporate producer or importer, or an administrator, executor, 
or trustee of an eligible producing or importing entity may cast a 
ballot on behalf of

[[Page 96]]

such producer or importer entity. Any individual so voting in a 
referendum shall certify that such individual is an officer or employee 
of the eligible producer or importer, or an administrator, executor, or 
trustee of an eligible producing or importing entity, and that such 
individual has the authority to take such action. Upon request of the 
referendum agent, the individual shall submit adequate evidence of such 
authority.
    (c) Ballots are to be cast by mail or fax.


<R05>
Sec. 1209.303  Instructions.

during which ballots may be cast.
    (b) Provide ballots and related material to be used in the

    (2) By such other means as the agent may deem advisable.
    (d) Mail to eligible producers and importers, whose names and 
addresses are known to the referendum agent, the instructions on voting, 
a ballot, and a summary of the terms and conditions of the Order. No 
person who claims to be eligible to vote shall be refused a ballot.

review the ballots and tabulate the results.
    (g) Prepare a report on the referendum.

the absence of such appointment, shall be performed by the agent.


<R05>

                   National Watermelon Promotion Board


<R05>
Sec. 1210.320  Establishment and membership.

    (a) There is hereby established a National Watermelon Promotion 
Board, hereinafter called the ``Board.'' The Board shall be composed of 
producers, handlers, importers, and one public representative appointed 
by the Secretary. An equal number of producer and handler 
representatives shall be nominated by producers and handlers pursuant to 
Sec. 1210.321. The Board shall also include one or more representatives 
of importers, who shall be nominated in such manner as may be prescribed 
by the Secretary. The public representative shall be nominated by the 
Board members in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. If 
producers, handlers, and importers fail to select nominees for 
appointment to the Board, the Secretary may appoint persons on the basis 
of representation as provided in Sec. 1210.324. If the Board fails to 
adhere to procedures prescribed by the Secretary for nominating a public 
representative, the Secretary shall appoint such representative.
    (b) Membership on the Board shall be determined on the basis of two 
handler and two producer representatives for each of seven districts in 
the contiguous States of the United States. Such districts as hereby 
established have approximately equal production volume according to the 
three-year average production as set forth in the USDA Crop Production 
Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981. They are:

District 1--South Florida including all areas south of State Highway 
50.
District 2--North Florida including all areas north of State Highway 
50.
District 3--The States of Alabama and Georgia.
District 4--The States of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, 
Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, 
Ohio, Michigan, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New 
Hampshire, and Maine.
District 5--The States of Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, 
Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, and New 
Mexico.
District 6--The State of Texas.
District 7--The States of Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, 
Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, and Montana.

    (c) After two years, the Board shall review the districts to 
determine whether realignment of the districts is necessary and at least 
every five years thereafter the Board shall make such a review. In 
making such review, it shall give consideration to:
    (1) The most recent three years USDA production reports or Board 
assessment reports if USDA production reports are unavailable;
    (2) Shifts and trends in quantities of watermelon produced, and
    (3) Other relevant factors.

As a result of this review, the Board may realign the districts subject 
to the approval of the Secretary. Any such realignment shall be 
recommended by the Board to the Secretary at least six months prior to 
the date of the call for nominations and shall become effective at least 
30 days prior to such date.
    (d) Importer representation on the Board shall be proportionate to 
the percentage of assessments paid by importers to the Board, except 
that at least one representative of importers shall serve on the Board.
    (e) Not later than 5 years after the date that importers are subject 
to the Plan, and every 5 years thereafter, the Secretary shall evaluate 
the average annual percentage of assessments paid by importers during 
the 3-year period preceding the date of the evaluation and adjust, to 
the extent practicable, the number of importer representatives on the 
Board.
    (f) The Board consists of 14 producers, 14 handlers, at least one 
importer,

[[Page 100]]

and one public member appointed by the Secretary.

made. The handler shall maintain separate records for each producer's 
watermelons handled, including watermelons produced by said handler. In 
addition, the handler shall indicate the total quantity of watermelons 
handled by the handler, including those that are exempt under this Plan, 
and such other information as may be prescribed by the Board.
    (d) Each importer shall be responsible for payment of the assessment 
to the Board on watermelons imported into the United States through the

rules and regulations approved by the Secretary.
    (e) Producer-handlers and handlers shall pay assessments to the 
Board at such time and in such manner as the Board, with the Secretary's 
approval, directs, pursuant to regulations issued under this part. Such 
regulations may provide for different handlers or classes of handlers 
and different handler payment and reporting schedules to recognize 
differences in marketing practices or procedures used in any State or 
production area.
    (f) There shall be a late payment charge imposed on any handler or 
importer who fails to remit to the Board the total amount for which any 
such handler or importer is liable on or before the payment due date 
established by the Board under paragraph (e) of this section. The amount 
of the late payment charge shall be set by the Board subject to approval 
by the Secretary.
    (g) There shall also be imposed on any handler or importer subject 
to a late payment charge, an additional charge in the form of interest 
on the outstanding portion of any amount for which the handler or 
importer is liable. The rate of such interest shall be prescribed by the 
Board subject to approval by the Secretary.

reimbursement by the Board for such services shall be based on 
reasonable charges for services rendered.

shall be entitled to apply for a refund that is equal to the rate of 
assessment paid by domestic producers.
    (c) The Secretary may adjust the quantity of the weight exemption

Sec. 1210.363  Suspension or termination.

    (a) Whenever the Secretary finds that this Plan or any provision 
thereof obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of 
the Act, the Secretary shall terminate or suspend the operation of this 
Plan or such provision thereof.
    (b) The Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time and shall 
hold a referendum on request of the Board or at least 10 percent of the 
combined total of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers to 
determine if watermelon producers, handlers, and importers favor 
termination or suspension of this Plan. The Secretary shall suspend or 
terminate this Plan at the end of the marketing year whenever the 
Secretary determines that the suspension or termination is favored by a 
majority of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers voting in 
such referendum who, during a representative period determined by the 
Secretary, have been engaged in the production, handling, or importing 
of watermelons and who produced, handled, or imported more than 50 
percent of the combined total of the volume of watermelons produced, 
handled, or imported by those producers, handlers, and importers voting 
in the referendum. For purposes of this section, the vote of a person 
who both produces and handles watermelons will be counted as a handler 
vote if the producer purchased watermelons from other producers, in a 
combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the 
producer's own production; or the combined total volume of watermelon 
handled by the producer from the producer's own production and purchases 
from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the 
producer's own production. Provided, That the vote of a person who both 
imports and handles watermelons will be counted as an importer vote if 
that person imports 50 percent or more of the combined total volume of 
watermelons handled and imported by that person. Any such referendum 
shall be conducted by mail ballot.

Sec. 1210.364  Proceedings after termination.

    (a) Upon the termination of this Plan, the Board shall recommend not 
more than five of its members to the Secretary to serve as trustees for 
the purpose of liquidating the affairs of the Board. Such persons, upon 
designation by the Secretary, shall become trustees of all funds and 
property then in possession or under control of the Board, including 
claims for any funds unpaid or property not delivered or any other claim 
existing at the time of such termination.
    (b) The said trustees shall:
    (1) Continue in such capacity until discharged by the Secretary;
    (2) Carry out the obligations of the Board under any contracts or 
agreements entered into by it pursuant to Sec. 1210.328(d);

    (4) Upon the request of the Secretary execute such assignments or 
other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person or 
persons full title and right to all the funds, property, and claims 
vested in the Board or the trustees pursuant to this section.
    (c) Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been 
transferred or delivered pursuant to this section shall be subject to 
the same obligation imposed upon the Board and upon the trustees.
    (d) A reasonable effort shall be made by the Board or its trustees 
to return to producers, handlers and importers any residual funds not 
required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation. If it is found 
impractical to return such remaining funds to producers, handlers and 
importers such funds shall be disposed of in such manner as the 
Secretary may determine to be appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.403  Voting procedures.

    (a) Proxy voting by producers and handlers for producer and handler 
nominees shall be permitted at all district conventions: Provided, That 
producers may cast proxy votes for producers only, and handlers may cast 
proxy votes for handlers only. In non-multi-State districts, proxy 
voting shall be permitted for all producer and handler nominee balloting 
to determine the districts' nominees. In multi-State districts, proxy 
voting shall be permitted for all producers and handlers participating 
in a State's balloting to determine the State's nominees. No other proxy 
voting, such as for district convention chairperson, shall be allowed. 
Any person wanting to cast proxy votes must demonstrate authorization to 
do so. Authority to cast a proxy vote on behalf of another person shall 
be demonstrated through documentation containing:
    (1) The proxy voter's name, address, and telephone number;
    (2) Signature and date signed;
    (3) A certification identifying the proxy voter as a producer or a 
handler; and
    (4) A statement identifying the person being given authority by the 
proxy voter to cast the proxy vote.

All proxy documentation must be received by the Board at its 
headquarters address at least two weeks before the district convention 
is scheduled to convene. For the purpose of the initial district 
convention, all proxy documentation must be forwarded to the Department 
representative identified in the call for the district convention in a 
manner that will ensure receipt, at the address specified in the call, 
at least 72 hours before the district convention is scheduled to 
convene. The Board, or in the case of the initial conventions the 
Department representative identified in the call or other representative 
of the Department, may challenge any proxy vote and disqualify any 
challenged vote for cause. In the case of duplicate proxy authorizations 
by any person, only the first authorization, determined by date will be 
allowed. In the case of duplicate dates, the proxy which is received 
first will be allowed.
    (b) In non-multi-State districts, convention chairpersons shall be 
elected by a majority vote of the eligible voters in attendance. In 
multi-State districts, the election shall be by majority vote of all 
States present with each State's vote(s) determined by a majority vote 
of the eligible voters of that State in attendance. Each such State is 
entitled to one vote, plus one additional vote for each 500,000 
hundredweight volume of production in the State as determined by the 
three-year average annual crop production summary reports of the 
Department or, if such reports are not published, then the three-year 
average of the Board's assessment reports: Provided, That for the first 
two conventions, the Department's Crop Production Annual Summary Reports 
for 1979, 1980, and 1981 will be controlling as to any additional 
production volume votes.
    (c) In multi-State districts 3, 4, 5 and 7, the convention 
chairperson will direct the eligible producer voters and handler voters 
from each State to caucus separately for the purpose of electing a State 
spokesperson for each group. Election of each State spokesperson shall 
be by simple majority of all individual voters in attendance. In lieu of 
written ballots, a State spokesperson may be elected by voice vote or a 
show of hands. The role of the State spokesperson is to coordinate State 
voting and to cast all State votes.
    (d) Convention chairpersons will coordinate the entire producer and 
handler nomination process. In conducting the nomination process, each 
convention chairperson will ensure that:
    (1) Voting for producer nominees is limited to producers, and voting 
for handler nominees is limited to handlers; and
    (2) Producer candidates for nomination are producers, and handler 
candidates for nomination are handlers.
    (e) Voting, for producer and handler nominees, in non-multi-State 
districts shall be on the basis of one vote per person, except that 
persons authorized to cast proxy votes shall be allowed to cast all 
proxy votes not disallowed by the Board or the Department. Election

[[Page 110]]

of nominees shall be on the basis of a simple majority of all eligible 
votes cast.
    (f) Voting for producer and handler nominees in multi-State 
districts shall be on a State by State basis. Producers and handlers 
from each State shall caucus separately, at the district convention, for 
the purpose of determining which nominees shall receive their State's 
vote(s) for membership on the Board. Each State's vote(s) shall be based 
on a simple majority of all votes (including proxy votes) cast by 
producers or handlers voting in their State's caucus. Each State 
represented at a multi-State district convention shall have one vote for 
each producer position and one vote for each handler position from the 
district on the Board. Each State shall further have an additional vote 
toward each position for each 500,000 hundredweight volume of production 
in the State as determined by the three-year average annual crop 
production summary reports of the Department or, if such reports are not 
published, then the three-year average of the Board's assessment 
reports: Provided, That for the first two calls for nominees, the 
Department's Crop Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 
1981 will be controlling as to any additional production volume votes. 
Each State spokesperson will cast the State's vote(s) for each nominee 
position. Election of nominees shall be on the basis of a simple 
majority of all State votes cast.
    (g) During the voting for convention chairperson, State 
spokesperson, and Board member nominee, should no candidate receive the 
required simple majority on the first ballot, the number of candidates 
may be reduced by dropping one or more of the lowest vote recipients 
from the list of candidates. The balloting will be repeated until the 
position is filled.
    (h) Two nominees shall be elected for each of the producer and 
handler positions from each district on the Board. The two nominees for 
each position shall be elected simultaneously. The convention 
chairperson will open the floor to the nomination of candidates for 
possible election as a Board member nominee for each available position. 
Each position will be dealt with separately (i.e., candidates for one 
position will be nominated and then elected before the convention moves 
on to the next available position). Each eligible voter may vote for two 
of the nominees on one ballot. The two nominees receiving the greatest 
number of votes and at least a simple majority of the votes cast will be 
elected as the district's Board member nominees for the position. No 
individual elected as a nominee for Board membership may be a candidate 
on subsequent Board member nominee ballots (i.e., two different producer 
names and two different handler names must be submitted as nominees for 
each producer and handler position from each district to the Secretary 
of Agriculture). There shall be no designation of first and second 
choice nominees.

    (f) Mail balloting. If nominations are conducted by mail ballot, the 
Board shall request importers to submit nominations of eligible 
importers. It is the importer's responsibility to prove the individual's 
eligibility. After the names of nominees are received, the Board shall 
print ballots and ask eligible importers to vote to nominate their 
candidates. After the vote is received, the Board shall tabulate the 
results and shall send to the Department the nominees in order of 
preference. The Board shall provide the Secretary with a report on the 
results, number of importers participating in the vote, and the volume 
of imports, and shall arrange for completion of qualification statements 
and other specified information by each nominee and forward such to the 
Secretary within 14 calendar days of receiving the ballots.
    (g) Any individual who both imports and handles watermelons will be 
considered an importer if that person imports 50 percent or more of the 
combined total volume of watermelons handled and imported by that 
person.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.517  Determination of handler.

    The producer and handler assessments on each lot of watermelons 
handled shall be paid by the handler. Unless otherwise provided in this 
section, the handler responsible for payment of assessments shall be the 
first handler of such watermelons. The first handler is the person who 
initially performs a handling function as heretofore defined. Such 
person may be a fresh shipper, processor, or other person who first 
places the watermelons in the current of commerce.
    (a) The following examples are provided to aid in the identification 
of first handlers:
    (1) Producer grades, packs, and sells watermelons of own production 
to a handler. In this instance, it is the handler, not the producer, who 
places the watermelons in the current of commerce. The handler is 
responsible for payment of the assessments.
    (2) Producer packs and sells watermelons of that producer's own 
production from the field, roadside stand, or storage to a consumer, 
trucker, retail or wholesales outlet, or other buyer who is not a 
handler of watermelons. The producer places the watermelons in the 
current of commerce and is the first handler.
    (3) Producer purchases watermelons from another producer. The 
producer purchasing the watermelons is the first handler.
    (4) Producer delivers field-run watermelons of own production to a 
handler for preparation for market and entry into the current of 
commerce. The handler, in this instance, is the first handler, 
regardless of whether the handler subsequently handles such watermelons 
for the account of the handler or for the account of the producer.
    (5) Producer delivers field-run watermelons of own production to a 
handler for preparation for market and return to the producer for sale. 
The producer in this instance, is the first handler, except when the 
producer subsequently sells such watermelons to a handler.
    (6) Producer delivers watermelons of own production to a handler who 
takes title to such watermelons. The handler who purchases such 
watermelons from the producer is the first handler.

<R05>
Sec. 1210.518  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Time of payment. The assessment on domestically produced 
watermelons shall become due at the time the first handler handles the 
watermelons for non-exempt purposes. The assessment on imported 
watermelons shall become due at the time of entry, or withdrawal, into 
the United States.
    (b) Responsibility for payment. (1) The first handler is responsible 
for payment of both the producer's and the handler's assessment. The 
handler may collect the producer's assessment from the producer or 
deduct such producer's assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer 
on whose watermelons the producer assessment is made. Any such 
collection or deduction of producer assessment shall be made not later 
than the time when the first handler handles the watermelons.
    (2) The U.S. Customs Service shall collect assessments on imported 
watermelons from importers and forward such assessments under an 
agreement between the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Importers shall be responsible for payment of assessments 
directly to the Board of any assessments due but not collected by the 
U.S. Customs Service at the time of entry, or withdrawal, on watermelons 
imported into the United States for human consumption.
    (c) Payment direct to the Board. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b) and (e) of this section, each handler and importer shall remit the 
required producer and handler assessments, pursuant to Sec. 1210.341 of 
the Plan, directly to the Board not later than 30 days after the end of 
the month such assessments are due. Remittance shall be by check, draft, 
or money order payable to the National Watermelon Promotion Board, or 
NWPB, and shall be accompanied by a report, preferably on Board forms, 
pursuant to Sec. 1210.350. To avoid late payment charges, the 
assessments must be mailed to the Board and postmarked within 30 days 
after the end of the month such assessments are due.
    (2) Pursuant to Sec. 1210.350 of the Plan, each handler shall file 
with the Board a report for each month that assessable watermelons were 
handled. All handler reports shall contain at least the following 
information:
    (i) The handler's name, address, and telephone number;
    (ii) Date of report (which is also the date of payment to the 
Board);
    (iii) Period covered by the report;
    (iv) Total quantity of watermelons handled during the reporting 
period;
    (v) Date of last report remitting assessments to the Board; and
    (vi) Listing of all persons for whom the handler handled 
watermelons, their addresses, hundredweight handled, and total 
assessments remitted for each producer. In lieu of such a list, the 
handler may substitute copies of settlement sheets given to each person 
or computer generated reports, provided such settlement sheets or 
computer reports contain all the information listed above.
    (vii) Name, address, and hundredweight handled for each person 
claiming exemption for assessment.
    (viii) If the handler handled watermelons for persons engaged in the 
growing of less than 10 acres of watermelons, the report shall indicate 
the name and address of such person and the quantity of watermelons 
handled for such person.
    (3) The words ``final report'' shall be shown on the last report at 
the close of the handler's marketing season or at the end of each fiscal 
period if such handler markets assessable watermelons on a year-round 
basis.
    (4) Prepayment of assessments. (i) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
and reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Board 
may permit handlers to make an advance payment of their total estimated 
assessments for the crop year to the Board prior to their actual 
determination of assessable watermelons. The Board shall not be 
obligated to pay interest on any advance payment.
    (ii) Handlers using such procedures shall provide a final annual 
report of actual handling and remit any unpaid assessments not later 
than 30 days after the end of the last month of the designated handler's 
marketing season

[[Page 115]]

or at the end of each fiscal period if such handler markets assessable 
watermelons on a year-round basis.
    (iii) Handlers using such procedures shall, after filing a final 
annual report, receive a reimbursement of any overpayment of 
assessments.
    (iv) Handlers using such procedures shall, at the request of the 
Board to verify a producer's refund claim, provide the Board with a 
handling report on any and all producers for whom the handler has 
provided handling services but has not yet filed a handling report with 
the Board.
    (v) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board on request.
    (d) Late payment charges and interest. (1) A late payment charge 
shall be imposed on any handler and importer who fails to make timely 
remittance to the Board of the total producer and handler and importer 
assessments for which any such handler and importer is liable. Such late 
payment shall be imposed on any assessments not received before the 
fortieth day after the end of the month such assessments are due. This 
one-time late payment charge shall be 10 percent of the assessments due 
before interest charges have accrued. The late payment charge will not 
be applied to any late payments postmarked within 30 days after the end 
of the month such assessments are due.
    (2) In addition to the late payment charge, one and one-half percent 
per month interest on the outstanding balance, including the late 
payment charge and any accrued interest, will be added to any accounts 
for which payment has not been received by the last day of the second 
month following the month of handling; Provided, that, handlers paying 
their assessments in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii), will not be 
subject to the one and one-half percent per month interest under this 
paragraph until the last day of the second month after such assessments 
are due under paragraph (c)(4)(ii). Such interest will continue monthly 
until the outstanding balance is paid to the Board.
    (e) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may enter into 
agreements, subject to approval of the Secretary, authorizing other 
organizations, such as a regional watermelon association or State 
watermelon board, to collect assessments in its behalf. In any State or 
area in which the Board has entered into such an agreement, the 
designated handler shall pay the assessment to such agency in the time 
and manner, and with such identifying information as specified in such 
agreement. Such an agreement shall not provide any cooperating agency 
with authority to collect confidential information from handlers or 
producers. To qualify, the cooperating agency must on its own accord 
have access to all information required by the Board for collection 
purposes. If the Board requires further evidence of payment than 
provided by the cooperating agency, it may acquire such evidence from 
individual handlers. All such agreements are subject to the requirements 
of the Act, Plan, and all applicable rules and regulations under the Act 
and the Plan.

Sec. 1210.519  Failure to report and remit.

    Any handler and importer who fails to submit reports and remittances 
according to the provisions of Sec. 1210.518 shall be subject to

following actions:

three previous fiscal years of the Board under Sec. 1220.223.
    (ii)(A) During the first fiscal year of the Board, the percentage 
used to determine the votes given to a unit will be based on annual

represented by more than one member, each member representing the unit 
shall receive an equal percentage of the votes allocated to the unit.

other members representing such unit shall vote, on an equal basis if 
there is more than one member representing the unit present, the number 
of votes which the absent member would have been entitled to vote.
    (iv) A motion will carry on a roll call vote if approved by both a 
simple majority of all votes cast and a simple majority of all units 
voting (with the vote of each unit determined by a simple majority of 
all votes cast by members in that unit).

members, or if a roll call vote is requested, a simple majority of all 
votes cast and a simple majority of all units voting by mail, telephone, 
facsimile, or telegraph, but any such action by telephone shall be 
confirmed promptly in writing. In the event that such action is taken, 
all members must be notified and provided the opportunity to vote. Any 
action so taken shall have the same force and effect as though such 
action had been taken at a regular or special meeting of the Board.
    (d) On or after the end of the three-year period beginning on the

soybeans purchased. Each first purchaser shall remit such assessment to 
the Board or to a Qualified State Soybean Board, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (2) Any producer marketing processed soybeans or soybean products of 
that producer's own production, shall remit to a Qualified State Soybean 
Board or to the Board, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
an assessment on such soybeans or soybean products at a rate of one-half 
of one percent (0.5%) of the net market price of the soybeans involved 
or the equivalent thereof.
    (3) In determining the assessment due from each producer under 
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, a producer who is 
contributing to a Qualified State Soybean Board shall receive a credit 
from the Board for contributions to such Qualified State Soybean Board 
on any soybeans assessed under this section in an amount not to exceed

assessed.
    (4) In order for a producer to receive the credit provided for in

in a State other than the State which is the situs of the first 
purchaser, the first purchaser that collects the assessment shall remit 
the assessment and information as to the State of origin of the soybeans 
to the Qualified State Soybean Board operating in the State in which the 
first purchaser is located. The Qualified State Soybean Board operating 
in the State in which the first purchaser is located shall remit such 
assessments to the Qualified State Soybean Board operating in the State 
in which the soybeans were grown. If no such Qualified State Soybean 
Board exists in such State, then the assessments shall be remitted to 
the Board. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may authorize 
Qualified State Soybean Boards to propose modifications to the foregoing 
``State of Origin'' rule to ensure effective coordination of assessment 
collections between Qualified State Soybean Boards.
    (ii)(A) If a producer pledges soybeans grown by that producer as 
collateral for a loan issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation and if 
that producer forfeits said soybeans in lieu of loan repayment, the 
Commodity Credit Corporation shall at the time of the loan settlement, 
collect from the producer the assessments due based on 0.5 percent of 
the principal loan amount received by the producer and remit the

[[Page 141]]

the soybeans were pledged, or if no Qualified State Soybean Board exists 
in such State, the Board.
    (B) If a producer redeems and subsequently markets soybeans which 
have been pledged as collateral for a loan issued by the Commodity 
Credit Corporation, the first purchaser shall collect and remit the 
assessments due pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or if a 
producer markets such soybeans as processed soybeans or as soybean 
products, the producer shall remit the assessment pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Qualified State Soybean Boards and the Board shall coordinate 
assessment collection procedures to ensure that producers marketing 
soybeans are required to pay only one assessment per bushel of soybeans 
and collections are adjusted among States on a mutually agreeable basis.
    (b) The collection of assessments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, shall commence on and after the date assessments are required 
to be paid and shall continue until terminated by the Secretary. If the 
Board is not constituted on the date the first assessments are to be 
collected, the Secretary shall have the authority to receive the 
assessments on behalf of the Board, and to hold such assessments until 
the Board is constituted, then remit such assessments to the Board.

this section, shall be increased two percent (2%) each month beginning

monthly on unpaid assessments and shall include any unpaid late charges 
previously applied pursuant to this section.
    (4) For the purpose of this section, any assessment that was 
determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a 
person's failure to submit a report to the Board or a Qualified State 
Soybean Board when due, shall be considered to have been payable by the 
date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due.
    (d) Prior to the continuance referendum, the Board, pursuant to 
procedures approved by the Secretary, shall ensure that each Qualified 
State Soybean Board is provided credit in accordance with the provisions 
of section 1969(n)(1) and subject to section 1969(n)(3) of the Act.
    (e) Following the continuance referendum, the Board, pursuant to 
procedures approved by the Secretary, shall ensure annually that each 
Qualified State Soybean Board is provided credit in accordance with the 
provisions of section 1969(n)(2) and subject to section 1969(n)(3) of 
the Act.

    (a) The Board shall receive and evaluate, or, on its own initiative, 
develop, and submit to the Secretary for approval, any plans and 
projects. Such plans and projects shall provide for:
    (1) The establishment, issuance, effectuation, and administration of 
appropriate plans and projects for promotion, research, and consumer

pork products;
    (2) The establishment and conduct of research and studies with 
respect to the sale, distribution, marketing, and utilization of pork

    (b) Each plan and project shall be periodically reviewed or 
evaluated by the Board to ensure that the plan and project contributes

terminate such plan and project.

section.

Sec. 1230.72  Distribution of assessments.

    Assessments remitted to the Board shall be distributed as follows:
    (a) Each State association shall receive on a monthly basis, a 
percentage determined by the Delegate Body or 16.5 percent, whichever is

assessments attributable to a State is the total amount of assessments 
received from producers in a State.
    (b) A State association which was conducting a pork promotion 
program in the period from July 1, 1984 to June 30, 1985, shall receive 
additional amounts at such times as the Board may determine, so that the 
total amount received on an annual basis would be equal to the amount 
that would have been collected in such State pursuant to the pork 
promotion program in existence in such State from July 1, 1984, to June 
30, 1985, had the porcine animals subject to assessment, been produced 
from July 1, 1984, to June 30, 1985, and been subject to the rates of 
assessment then in effect from such State to the Council and other 
national entities involved in pork promotion, research, and consumer 
information. This paragraph shall apply to a State association only if 
the annual amount determined under this paragraph would be greater than 
the annual amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The Council shall receive on a monthly basis 35 percent of the 
net assessments until after the referendum is conducted, and 25 percent 
thereafter and until 12 months after the referendum.

<R05>
Sec. 1230.73  Uses of distributed assessments.

    (a) Each State association shall use its distribution of assessments 
pursuant to Sec. 1230.72, as well as any proceeds from the investment of 
such funds pending their use, for financing plans and projects and the 
administrative expenses incurred in connection therewith, including the 
cost of administering nominations and elections of producer members of 
the Delegate Body.
    (b) The Council shall use its distribution of assessments pursuant 
to Sec. 1230.72, as well as any proceeds from the investment of such 
funds pending their use, for financing plans and projects and the 
Council's administrative expenses.
    (c) The Board shall use its distribution of assessments pursuant to 
Sec. 1230.72, as well as any proceeds from the investment of such funds 
pending their use, for:
    (1) Financing plans and projects;
    (2) The Board's expenses for the Board's administration, 
maintenance, and functioning as authorized by the Secretary;
    (3) Accumulation of a reserve not to exceed one fiscal period's 
budget to permit continuation of an effective promotion, research, and 
consumer information program in years when assessment amounts may be 
reduced; and
    (4) The Secretary's administrative costs in carrying out this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1230.74  Prohibited use of distributed assessments.

    (a) No funds collected under this subpart shall in any manner be 
used for the purpose of influencing legislation as that term is defined 
in section 4911 (d) and (e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or 
for the purpose of influencing governmental policy or action except in 
recommending to the Secretary amendments to this part.
    (b) Organizations receiving distributions of assessments from the 
Board shall furnish the Board with annual financial statements audited 
by a certified public accountant of all funds distributed to such 
organizations pursuant to this subpart and any other reports as may be 
required by the Secretary or the Board in order to verify the use of 
such funds.

60 FR 33683, June 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1230.75  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever the Board or the Department determines, through an audit of 
a

[[Page 159]]

person's reports, records, books or accounts or through some other means 
that additional money is due the Board or that money is due such person 
from the Board, such person shall be notified of the amount due. Any 
amount due the Board shall be remitted to the Board by the next date for 
remitting assessments as provided in Sec. 1230.71(b)(3). Any overpayment 
to the Board shall be credited to the account of the person remitting 
the overpayment and shall be applied against amounts due in succeeding 
months except that the Board shall make prompt payment when an 
overpayment cannot be adjusted by a credit.


<R05>
Sec. 1230.76  Charges.

    Any assessment not paid when due shall be increased 1.5 percent each 
month beginning with the day following the date such assessment was due. 
Any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges 
previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at the same 
rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. For 
the purpose of this section, any assessment that was determined at a 
date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a person's failure 
to submit a report to the Board when due shall be considered to have 
been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been 
filed when due. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based 
on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the 
Board, whichever is earlier.

as a result of the adjustment of the boundaries of the regions in 
accordance with Sec. 1240.32(b)(6), a producer member or alternate is no 
longer from the region from which such person was appointed, such member 
or alternate may serve out the term for which such person was appointed.
    (b) If a member of the Board consistently refuses to perform the 
duties of a member of the Board, or if a member of the Board engages in 
acts of dishonesty or willful misconduct, the Board may recommend to the

his/her pro rata share of such expenses as may be approved by the 
Secretary pursuant to Sec. 1240.40. Such pro rata share shall be the 
amount established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 1240.42 and in paragraphs (e), (f), 
and (g) of this section, the first handler shall be responsible for the 
collection of such assessment from the producer and payment thereof to 
the Board. The first handler shall maintain separate records for each 
producer's honey handled, including honey produced by said handler.
    (c) The assessment on honey shall be levied at a rate fixed by the 
Secretary which shall be $0.01 per pound of honey or honey used in honey 
products.
    (d) Should a deficit occur during any fiscal period, funds to cover 
the deficit may be obtained by increasing the rate of assessment subject 
to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section. The increased rate 
of assessment shall be applied to all honey and the honey used in 
products wherein honey is the primary ingredient sold in the States 
during that particular fiscal period so that the total payments by each 
person during each fiscal period will be proportional to the total value 
of the honey and honey products sold during that period.
    (e) The importer of imported honey and honey products shall pay the 
assessment to the Board at the time of entry of such honey and honey 
products into any State.
    (f) Producer-packers shall pay to the Board the assessment on the 
honey for which they act as first handler.
    (g) Whenever a loan is made on honey under the Honey Loan-Price 
Support Program, the Secretary shall provide that the assessment be 
deducted from the proceeds of the loan or the loan deficiency payment, 
if applicable, and that the amount of such assessment shall be forwarded 
to the Board, except that the assessment shall not be deducted by the 
Secretary in the case of a honey marketing cooperative that has already 
deducted the assessment. As soon as practicable after the assessment is 
deducted from the loan funds or loan deficiency payment, the Secretary 
shall provide the producer with proof of payment of the assessment.
    (h) Should a first handler or the Secretary fail to collect an 
assessment from a producer, the producer shall be responsible for the 
payment of the assessment to the Board.
    (i) Assessments shall be paid to the Board at such time and in such 
manner as the Board, with the Secretary's approval, directs pursuant to 
regulations issued hereunder. Such regulations may provide for different 
handler, importer, or producer-packer payment schedules so as to 
recognize differences in marketing or purchasing practices and 
procedures.
    (j) There shall be a late payment charge imposed on any handler, 
importer, or producer-packer who fails to remit to the Board the total 
amount for which any such handler, importer, or producer-packer is 
liable on or before the payment due date established by the Board under 
paragraph (h) of this section. The amount of the late payment charge 
shall be set by the Board subject to approval by the Secretary.
    (k) There shall also be imposed on any handler, importer, or 
producer-packer subject to a late payment charge, an additional charge 
in the form of interest on the outstanding portion of any amount for 
which the handler, importer, or producer-packer is liable. The rate of 
such interest shall be prescribed by the Board subject to approval by 
the Secretary, but shall not exceed the maximum legal rate of interest, 
if any, as established by Congress.
    (l) The Board is hereby authorized to accept advance payment of 
assessments by handlers, importers, or producer-packers that shall be 
credited toward any amount for which the handlers, importers or 
producer-packers may become liable. The Board is not obligated to pay 
interest on any advance payment.
    (m) The Board is hereby authorized to borrow money for the payment 
of expenses subject to the same fiscal,

Sec. 1240.42  Exemption from assessment.

    (a) A producer who produces less than 6,000 pounds of honey per 
year, or a producer-packer who produces and handles less than 6,000 
pounds of honey per year or an importer who imports less than 6,000 
pounds of honey per year on honey which such person distributes directly 
through local retail outlets such as roadside stands, farmers markets, 
groceries, or other outlets as otherwise determined by the Secretary, 
during such year shall be eligible for an exemption from the assessment.
    (b) A producer or importer who consumes honey at home or donates 
honey to a nonprofit, government, or other entity, as determined 
appropriate by the Secretary, rather then sell such honey, shall be 
exempt from the assessment on that honey so consumed or donated, except 
for honey donated that is later sold in a commercial outlet by a donee 
or donee's assignee.
    (c) To claim such exemption, a producer, producer-packer, or 
importer shall submit an application to the Board stating the basis on 
which the person claims the exemption for such year.
    (d) If, after a person claims an exemption from assessments for any 
year under this subparagraph, and such person no longer meets the 
requirements of this subparagraph for an exemption, such person shall 
file a report with the Board in the form and manner prescribed by the 
Board and pay an assessment on or before March 15 of the subsequent year 
on all honey produced or imported by such person during the year for 
which the person claimed the exemption.
    (e) The Board may recommend to the Secretary that honey exported 
from the States be exempted from the provisions of this order, and 
include procedures for the refund of assessments on such honey and such 
safeguards as may be necessary to prevent improper use of this 
exemption.
    (f) The Board shall determine those States that are operating a 
program with objectives comparable to the objectives of the Act and 
recommend to the Secretary that they be exempted from a portion of the 
assessments collected by the Federal program. The amount of such 
assessments subject to exemption shall not exceed the amount authorized 
by the State plan on January 1, 1985, unless a State provides evidence 
that it was in the process of promulgating a different assessment level 
on January 1, 1985, then the new assessment level promulgated will be 
exempt upon approval of the honey producers in that State. Producers 
having an exemption from a portion of the assessments under this order, 
due to payment of assessments to a State plan, shall be required to 
furnish evidence to the Board that the assessments to the State plan 
have been paid.

whether he or she handles the honey for his or her own account or for 
the account of the producer or the account of other persons.
    (b) When a producer delivers honey to a handler who takes title to 
such honey, and places it in storage, such handler is the first handler.
    (c) When a producer delivers honey to a commercial storage facility 
for the purpose of holding such honey under his or her own account for 
later sale, the first handler of such honey would be identified on the 
basis of later handling of such honey.

her own production directly to a commercial user or food processor who 
utilizes such honey as an ingredient in the manufacture of formulated 
products, the producer is a producer-packer.
    (f) When a producer uses honey from his or her own production in the

Sec. 1240.115  Levy of assessments.

    (a) Time of payment. The assessment shall become due at the time 
assessable honey is first handled or entered or withdrawn for 
consumption into the United States pursuant to this part.
    (b) An assessment of one cent per pound is levied on honey produced 
in the United States, on imported honey entered or withdrawn for 
consumption into the United States, and on honey used in imported honey 
products entered or withdrawn for consumption into the United States 
except that assessments shall not be levied on the following:
    (1) Any persons other than importers holding a valid exemption 
certificate during the twelve month period ending on December 31;
    (2) That portion of honey which does not enter the current of 
commerce which is utilized solely to sustain a producers or producer-
packer's own colonies of bees;
    (3) That portion of otherwise assessable honey which is contained in 
imported products wherein honey is not a principal ingredient. Honey 
subject to assessment shall be assessed only once.
    (c) The assessment on each lot of honey handled in the United States 
shall be paid by the first handler who handles, or by the producer-
packer who produces and handles such honey.
    (1) The first handler shall collect and pay assessments to the Board 
unless such handler has received documentation acceptable to the Board 
that the assessment has been previously paid.
    (2) A producer-packer shall pay, or collect and pay, assessments to 
the Board unless--
    (i) Such producer-packer has obtained an exemption from the Board 
applicable to the honey which that producer-packer produced or produced 
and handled; or
    (ii) Has received documentation acceptable to the Board that the 
assessment has been previously paid.
    (d) Assessments shall be levied with respect to honey pledged as 
collateral for a loan or loan deficiency payment under the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC) Honey Price Support Program in accordance with 
an agreement entered into between the Honey Board and the CCC. The 
assessment will be deducted from the proceeds of the loan or loan 
deficiency payment by the CCC and forwarded to the Board, except that 
the assessment shall not be deducted in the case of a honey marketing 
cooperative that has already deducted the assessment or that portion of 
the assessment paid to a qualified State plan exempted by the Board. The 
Secretary, through the CCC, shall provide for the producer to receive a 
statement of the amount of the assessment deducted from the loan funds 
or loan deficiency payment promptly after each occasion when an 
assessment is deducted from any such loan funds or payment under this 
subsection.
    (e) The U.S. Customs Service (USCS) will collect assessments on all 
honey or honey products where honey is the principal ingredient imported 
under its tariff schedule (HTS heading numbers 0409.00.00 and 
2106.90.9988) at the time of entry or withdrawal for consumption and 
forward such assessment as per the agreement between the USCS and USDA. 
Any importer or agent who is exempt from payment of assessments

[[Page 177]]

pursuant to Sec. 1240.42 (a) and (b) of the Order may apply to the Board 
for reimbursement of such assessment paid.
    (f) A late payment charge shall be imposed on any handler, producer-
packer, or importer except as otherwise authorized by the Board, who 
fails to pay to the Board within the time prescribed in this subpart the 
total amount of assessment due for which any such handler, importer, or 
producer-packer is liable. Fifteen days after the assessment becomes due 
a one-time late payment charge of 10 percent will be added to any 
outstanding funds due the Board.
    (g) In addition to the late payment charge, one and one-half percent 
per month interest on the outstanding balance except as otherwise 
authorized by the Board, will be added to any accounts delinquent over 
30 days and will continue monthly until the outstanding balance is paid 
to the Board.

<R05>
Sec. 1240.116  Payment of assessments.

    (a) Responsibility for payment. Unless otherwise authorized by the 
Board under the Act and Order, the first handler or producer-packer 
shall collect the assessment from the producer, or deduct such 
assessment from the proceeds paid to the producer on whose honey the 
assessment is made, and remit the assessments to the Board. The first 
handler or producer-packer shall furnish the producer with evidence of 
such payment. Any such collection or deduction of assessment shall be 
made not later than the time when the assessment becomes payable to the 
Board. Failure of the handler or producer-packer to collect or deduct 
such assessment does not relieve the handler or producer-packer of his 
or her obligation to remit the assessment to the Board. However, should 
a first handler or the Secretary fail to collect an assessment from a 
producer, the producer shall be responsible for the payment of the 
assessment to the Board. Assessments on imported honey and honey 
products shall be collected as specified in Sec. 1240.115(e); Provided, 
That importers shall be responsible for payment of any assessment amount 
not collected by the U.S. Customs Service at the time of entry or 
withdrawal for consumption into the United States.
    (b) Payment directly to the Board. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, each first handler and producer-packer shall pay 
the required assessment pursuant to Sec. 1240.41 of the Order directly 
to the Board at the address referenced in Sec. 1240.106, for each 
reporting period specified in Sec. 1240.119, on or before the 15th day 
following the end of such period. Payment shall be in the form of a 
check, draft, or money order payable to the Board and shall be 
accompanied by a report on Board forms pursuant to Sec. 1240.50.
    (c) Prepayment of assessment. (1) In lieu of the monthly assessment 
payment specified in Sec. 1240.119 of this subpart, the Board may permit 
first handlers or producer-packers to make advance payments of their 
total estimated assessments for the season to the Board prior to their 
actual determination of assessable honey.
    (2) Persons using such procedure shall provide a monthly accounting 
of actual handling and assessments.
    (3) Specific requirements, instructions, and forms for making such 
advance payments shall be provided by the Board upon request.
    (d) Payment through cooperating agency. The Board may enter into 
agreements subject to approval of the Secretary authorizing other 
organizations to collect assessments in its behalf. All such agreements 
are subject to the requirements of the Act, Order, and all applicable 
rules and regulations under the Act and the Order.

importer's death, bankruptcy, receivership, or incapacity to act, the

on the Board to represent the geographic area in which the organization 
represents egg producers. Such eligibility shall be based in addition to 
other available information upon a factual report submitted by the 
organization which shall contain information deemed relevant and 
specified by the Secretary for the making of such determination, 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) Geographic territory covered by the organization's active 
membership;
    (b) Nature and size of the organization's active membership, 
proportion of total of such active membership accounted for by producers 
of commercial eggs, a chart showing the egg production by State in which 
the organization has members, and the volume of commercial eggs produced 
by the organization's active membership in such State(s);
    (c) The extent to which the commercial egg producer membership of 
such organization is represented in setting the organization's policies;
    (d) Evidence of stability and permanency of the organization;
    (e) Sources from which the organization's operating funds are 
derived;
    (f) Functions of the organization; and
    (g) The organization's ability and willingness to further the aims 
and objectives of the act.

The primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an 
organization shall be whether its egg producer membership consists of a 
substantial number of egg producers who produce a substantial volume of 
the applicable geographic area's commercial eggs to

[[Page 190]]

reasonably warrant its participation in the nomination of members for 
the Board or to request the issuance of an order. The Secretary shall 
certify any organization which he finds to be eligible under this 
section and his determination as to eligibility shall be final.

<R05>
Sec. 1250.515  Reporting period and payment.

    (a) For the purpose of the payment of assessments, either a calendar 
month or a 4-week accounting period shall be considered the reporting 
period; however, other accounting periods may be used when approved by 
the Board on an individual basis. Each collecting handler shall register 
his reporting period with the Board. All changes in reporting periods 
shall be requested in writing and subject to approval by the Board.
    (b) Each producer shall pay the required assessment on his 
commercial eggs pursuant to Sec. 1250.514 to the collecting handler 
designated in Sec. 1250.516 on or before the date of final settlement 
between the producer and the collecting handler for the eggs received by 
the collecting handler during each reporting period.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.516  Collecting handlers and collection.

    (a) Handlers responsible for collecting the assessments shall be any 
of the following:
    (1) The first person to whom eggs are sold, consigned, or delivered 
by producers and who grades, cartons, or breaks such eggs. Such shell 
egg breaker or egg packer must collect and remit to the Board the 
assessments on all eggs handled except eggs for which there is a 
certification of exemption or eggs for which there is a statement 
indicating that an assessment has already been paid;
    (2) A person who buys or receives nest run eggs from a producer and 
who does not grade, carton, or break such eggs. Such person shall 
collect the assessment from the producer and remit to the Egg Board on 
all such eggs, except for which there is a certification of exemption or 
eggs for which there is a statement indicating that an assessment has 
already been paid;
    (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, a producer who grades, cartons, or breaks eggs of his own 
production shall be responsible for remitting the assessment to the 
Board on all eggs produced. This would include the eggs which he grades, 
cartons, or breaks as well as the nest run eggs which are graded, 
cartoned, or broken by another handler. Such a producer who remits the 
assessment on nest run eggs to the Board shall provide the handler 
specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section with a written 
statement that the assessment has already been paid on the nest run 
eggs; or
    (4) Upon approval of the Board, any person who handles eggs for a 
producer under a written contract that includes express provisions that 
said handler will remit the assessment on such eggs to the Board shall 
be the collecting handler notwithstanding the fact that the producer may 
have graded, cartoned, or otherwise processed the eggs.

    Following are some examples to aid in identification of collecting 
handlers:
    (i) Producer sells, assigns, consigns, or otherwise delivers nest 
run eggs of his own production to a shell egg packer or breaker for 
preparation for market--the shell egg packer or breaker is the 
collecting handler and is responsible for remitting to the Egg Board;
    (ii) Producer grades, cartons, breaks, or otherwise prepares for 
marketing a portion of the eggs of his own production and delivers the 
remaining portion of his nest run eggs to a shell egg packer or 
breaker--the producer is the collecting handler and shall remit the 
assessment on his total production to the Board;
    (iii) Producer sells all or a portion of his eggs in nest run form 
to a handler who is not a shell egg packer or breaker--the handler is 
responsible for collecting the assessment and remitting it to the Egg 
Board except for eggs covered by a statement indicating that an 
assessment has already been paid;
    (iv) A shell egg packer or breaker who buys or receives nest run 
eggs from a handler who is not a shell egg packer or breaker--the 
handler is the collecting handler and shall remit such assessment to the 
Board;
    (v) A shell egg packer or egg breaker buys nest run or graded eggs 
including undergrade eggs from another shell egg packer or egg breaker--
the first shell egg packer or breaker is the collecting handler and 
shall remit such assessments to the Board.


[[Page 195]]


    (b) In the event of a producer's death, bankruptcy, receivership, or 
incapacity to act, the representative of the producer or his estate, or 
the person acting on behalf of creditors, shall be considered the 
producer of the eggs for the purpose of this subpart.
    (c) The collecting handler may collect the assessment directly from 
the producer or deduct the assessment from the proceeds due or paid to 
the producer on whose eggs the assessment is made.

[41 FR 22925, June 8, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 60724, Nov. 29, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1250.517  Remittance to Egg Board.

    (a) The collecting handler responsible for remittance of assessments 
to the Board is not relieved of this obligation as a result of his 
failure to collect payment of the assessment from the egg producer(s).
    (b) Each collecting handler required to remit the assessments on the 
eggs handled during each reporting period, specified in 
Sec. 1250.515(a), shall remit the assessments directly to the Egg Board 
by check, draft, or money order payable to the Egg Board on or before 
the 15th day after the end of said reporting period together with a 
report pursuant to Sec. 1250.529. The assessment for each reporting 
period shall be calculated on the basis of the gross volume of eggs 
subject to assessment received by the collecting handler during each 
reporting period.
    (c) Remittance through cooperating agency.
    (1) In any State or specified geographic area the Egg Board, with 
the approval of the Secretary, may designate by agreement a cooperating 
agency to collect the assessments in its behalf. Every collecting 
handler within such a State or geographic area shall remit the 
assessments for each reporting period, specified in Sec. 1250.515(a), to 
the designated cooperating agency by check, draft, or money order 
payable to said cooperating agency on or before the 15th day after the 
end of said reporting period together with a report pursuant to 
Sec. 1250.529.
    (2) On or before the 20th day after the end of each reporting 
period, each designated cooperating agency shall remit to the Egg Board 
the total amount of all assessments received from collecting handlers 
for said reporting period together with all collecting handler reports. 
In addition, each designated cooperating agency shall submit to the Egg 
Board such information as is required by the designation agreement with 
the Egg Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.518  Receipts for payment of assessments.

    (a) Each collecting handler shall give each producer whose eggs are 
subject to assessment a receipt for the commercial eggs handled by said 
collecting handler showing payment of the assessment. This receipt may 
be on a separate receipt form or included as part of the invoice or 
settlement sheet for the eggs, but in either event shall contain the 
following information:
    (1) Name, address, and identification number of the collecting 
handler;
    (2) Name and address of the producer who paid the assessment;
    (3) Number of cases of eggs on which assessment was paid and the 
total amount of the assessment; and
    (4) Date on which assessment was paid by producer.
    (b) All eggs sold, consigned, or delivered from a collecting handler 
to another handler, excluding cartoned eggs and loose graded eggs sold 
to the bakeries, restaurants, and institutions, shall be accompanied 
with the collecting handler's written statement that the assessment on 
the lot of eggs covered by the invoice has been paid or that lot of eggs 
or portion thereof is exempt from assessment under provisions of 
Sec. 1250.514.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.519  Late-payment charge.

    Any unpaid assessments due to the Board pursuant to Sec. 1250.347 
shall be increased by a late-payment charge of 1.5 percent each month 
beginning with the day following the date such assessments are 30 days 
past due. Any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid 
charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at 
the same rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until 
paid. Assessments that are not paid when due because of a person's 
failure to submit a handler report to the Board as required shall accrue 
late-

[[Page 196]]

payment charges from the time such assessments should have been 
remitted. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based on the 
applicable postmark date or the date payment is actually received by the 
Board, whichever is earlier.

inventories throughout the United States and the volume of imported 
cattle, beef, and beef products and, if warranted, shall reapportion

[[Page 202]]

    (2) States which do not have total cattle inventories equal to or 
greater than five hundred thousand (500,000) head of cattle shall be 
grouped, to the extent practicable, into geographically contiguous units 
each of which have a combined total inventory of not less than 500,000 
head of cattle and such unit(s) shall be entitled to at least one 
representative on the Board;
    (3) Importers shall be represented by a single unit, with the number 
of Board members representing such unit based upon a conversion of the 
total volume of imported cattle, beef or beef products into live animal 
equivalencies;
    (4) Each unit shall be entitled to representation by an additional 
Board member for each one million (1,000,000) head of cattle within the 
unit which exceeds the initial five hundred thousand (500,000) head of 
cattle within the unit qualifying such unit for representation.
    (f) In determining the volume of cattle within the units, the Board 
and the Secretary shall utilize the information received by the Board 
pursuant to Secs. 1260.201 and 1260.202 industry data and data published 
by the Department.

                               Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 1260.172  Assessments.

    (a) Domestic assessments. (1) Except as prescribed by regulations 
approved by the Secretary, each person making payment to a producer for 
cattle purchased from such producer shall be a collecting person and 
shall collect an assessment from the producer, and each producer shall 
pay such assessment to the collecting person, at the rate of one dollar 
($1) per head of cattle purchased and such collecting person shall remit 
the assessment to the Board or to a qualified State beef council 
pursuant to Sec. 1260.172(a)(5).
    (2) Any producer marketing cattle of that producer's own production 
in the form of beef or beef products to consumers, either directly or 
through retail or wholesale outlets, or for export purposes, shall remit 
to a qualified State beef council or to the Board an assessment on such 
cattle at the rate of one dollar ($1) per head of cattle or the 
equivalent thereof.
    (3) In determining the assessment due from each producer pursuant to 
Sec. 1260.172(a), a producer who is contributing to a qualified State 
beef council(s) shall receive a credit from the Board for contributions 
to such Council, but not to exceed 50 cents per head of cattle assessed.
    (4) In order for a producer described in Sec. 1260.172(a) to receive 
the credit authorized in Sec. 1260.172(a)(3), the qualified State beef 
council or the collecting person must establish to the satisfaction of 
the Board that the producer has contributed to a qualified State beef 
council.
    (5) Each person responsible for the remittance of the assessment 
pursuant to Sec. 1260.172 (a) (1) and (2) shall remit the assessment to 
the qualified State beef council in the State from which the cattle 
originated prior to sale, or if there is no qualified State beef council 
within such State, the assessment shall be remitted directly to the 
Board. However, the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may 
authorize qualified

[[Page 208]]

State beef councils to propose modifications to the foregoing ``State of 
origin'' rule to ensure effective coordination of assessment collections 
between qualified State beef councils. Qualified State beef councils and 
the Board shall coordinate assessment collection procedures to ensure 
that producers selling or marketing cattle in interstate commerce are 
required to pay only one assessment per individual sale of cattle. For 
the purpose of this subpart, ``State of origin'' rule means the State 
where the cattle were located at time of sale, or the State in which the 
cattle were located prior to sale if such cattle were transported 
interstate for the sole purpose of sale. Assessments shall be remitted 
not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which 
the cattle were purchased or marketed.
    (6) If a State law or regulation promulgated pursuant to State law 
requires the payment and collection of a mandatory, nonrefundable 
assessment of more fifty (50) cents per head on the sale and purchase of 
cattle, or the equivalent thereof for beef and beef products as 
described in Sec. 1260.172 (a)(1) and (2) for use by a qualified State 
beef council to fund activities similar to those described in 
Sec. 1260.169, and such State law or regulation authorizes the issuance 
of a credit of that amount of the assessment which exceeds fifty (50) 
cents to producers who waive any right to the refund of the assessment 
credited by the State due pursuant to this subpart, then any producer 
subject to such State law or regulation who pays only the amount due 
pursuant to such State law or regulation and this subpart, including any 
credits issued, shall thereby waive that producer's right to receipt 
from the Board of a refund of such assessment for that portion of such 
refund for which the producer received credit pursuant to such State law 
or regulation.
    (b) Importer assessments. (1) Importers of cattle, beef, and beef 
products into the United States shall pay an assessment to the Board 
through the U.S. Customs Service, or in such other manner as may be 
established by regulations approved by the Secretary.
    (2) The assessment rates for imported cattle, beef, and beef 
products are as follows:

with this subpart with regard to the payment of such assessments;
    (4) Certify to the Board that such organization shall remit to the 
Board assessments paid and remitted to the council, minus authorized 
credits issued to producers pursuant to Sec. 1260.172(a)(3), by the last

State beef council unless the Board determines a different date for 
remittance of assessments.

    (a) Designation. The agency for the administration of the Pricing 
Regulation shall be the compact commission.
    (b) Powers. The compact commission shall have the following powers:
    (1) Administer the pricing regulation in accordance with its terms 
and provisions;
    (2) Make rules and regulations to effectuate the terms and 
provisions of the pricing regulation;
    (3) Receive and investigate complaints of violations;
    (4) Recommend amendments.
    (c) Duties. The compact commission shall perform all the duties 
necessary to administer the terms and provisions of the pricing 
regulation, including, but not limited to the following:
    (1) Employ and fix the compensation of persons necessary to enable 
them to exercise their powers and perform their duties;
    (2) Pay out of funds provided by the administrative assessment all 
expenses necessarily incurred in the maintenance and functioning of 
their office and in the performance of their duties;
    (3) Keep records which will clearly reflect the transactions 
provided for in the pricing regulation;
    (4) Announce publicly at its discretion, by such means as it deems 
appropriate, the name of any handler who, after the date upon which he 
is required to perform such act, has not:
    (i) Made reports required by the pricing regulation;
    (ii) Made payments required by the pricing regulation; or
    (iii) Made available records and facilities as required pursuant to 
Sec. 1300.3;
    (5) Prescribe reports required of each handler under the pricing 
regulation. Verify such reports and the payments required by the pricing 
regulation by examining records (including such papers as copies of 
income tax reports, fiscal and product accounts, correspondence, 
contracts, documents or memoranda,) of the handler, and the records of 
any other person that are relevant to the handler's obligation under the 
pricing regulation, by examining such handler's milk handling 
facilities; and by such other investigation as the compact commission 
deems necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any 
report or any obligation under the pricing regulation. Reclassify fluid 
milk product received by any handler if such examination and 
investigation discloses that the original classification was incorrect;
    (6) Furnish each regulated handler a written statement of such 
handler's accounts with the compact commission promptly each month. 
Furnish a corrected statement to such handler if verification discloses 
that the original statement was incorrect; and
    (7) Prepare and disseminate publicly for the benefit of producers, 
handlers, and consumers such statistics and other information covering 
operation of the pricing regulation and facts relevant to the provisions 
thereof (or proposed provisions) as do not reveal confidential 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.2  Continuity and separability of provisions.

    (a) Effective time. The provisions of this pricing regulation or any 
amendment to the pricing regulation shall become effective at such time 
as the compact commission may declare and shall continue in force until 
suspended or terminated.
    (b) Suspension or termination. The compact commission shall suspend 
or terminate any or all of the provisions of the pricing regulation 
whenever they find that such provision(s) obstructs or does not tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the compact. The pricing regulation 
shall terminate whenever the provisions of the compact authorizing it 
cease to be in effect.
    (c) Continuing obligations. If upon the suspension or termination of 
any or all

[[Page 222]]

of the provisions of the pricing regulation there are any obligations 
arising under the pricing regulation, the final accrual or ascertainment 
of which requires acts by any handler, by the compact commission, or by 
any other person, the power and duty to perform such further acts shall 
continue notwithstanding such suspensions or termination.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.3  Handler responsibility for records and facilities.

    Each handler shall maintain and retain records of his operations and 
make such records and his facilities available to the compact 
commission. If adequate records of a handler, or of any other person, 
that are relevant to the obligation of such handler are not maintained 
and made available, any fluid milk product required to be reported by 
such handler for which adequate records are not available shall not be 
considered accounted for or established as used in a class other than 
the highest price class.
    (a) Records to be maintained. (1) Each handler shall maintain 
records of his operations (including, but not limited to, records of 
purchases, sales, processing, packaging and disposition) as are 
necessary to verify whether such handler has any obligation under the 
pricing regulation and if so, the amount of such obligation. Such 
records shall be such as to establish for each plant or other receiving 
point for each month:
    (i) The quantities of fluid milk product contained in, or 
represented by, products received in any form, including inventories on 
hand at the beginning of the month, according to form, time and source 
of each receipt;
    (ii) The utilization of all fluid milk product showing the 
respective quantities of such fluid milk product in each form disposed 
of or on hand at the end of the month; and
    (iii) Payments to producers, dairy farmers and cooperative 
associations, including the amount and nature of any deductions and the 
disbursement of money so deducted.
    (2) Each handler shall keep such other specific records as the 
compact commission deems necessary to verify or establish such handler's 
obligation under the pricing regulation.
    (b) Availability of records and facilities. Each handler shall make 
available all records pertaining to such handler's operation and all 
facilities the compact commission finds are necessary to verify the 
information required to be reported by the pricing regulation and/or to 
ascertain such handler's reporting, monetary or other obligation under 
the pricing regulation. Each handler shall permit the compact commission 
to observe plant operations and equipment and make available to the 
compact commission such facilities as are necessary to carry out their 
duties.
    (c) Retention of records. All records required under the pricing 
regulation to be made available to the compact commission shall be 
retained by the handler for a period of three years to begin at the end 
of the month to which such records pertain. If, within such a three year 
period, the compact commission notifies the handler in writing that the 
retention of such records, or of specified records, is necessary in 
connection with a proceeding or court action specified in such notice, 
the handler shall retain such records, or specified records, until 
further written notification from the compact commission. The compact 
commission shall give further written notification to the handler 
promptly upon the termination of the litigation or when the records are 
no longer necessary in connection therewith.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.4  Termination of obligation.

    The provision of this section shall apply to any obligation under 
the pricing regulation for the payment of money:
    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
the obligation of any handler to pay money required to be paid under the 
terms of the pricing regulation shall terminate two years after the last 
day of the month during which the compact commission receives the 
handler's report of receipts and utilization on which such obligation is 
based, unless within such a two year period, the compact commission 
notifies the handler in writing that such money is due and payable. 
Service of such written notice shall be complete upon mailing to the 
handler's last known address and it shall contain

[[Page 223]]

but need not be limited to the following information:
    The amount of the obligation;
    (2) The month(s) on which such obligation is based; and
    (3) If the obligation is payable to one or more producers or to a 
cooperative association, the name of such producer(s) or such 
cooperative association, or if the obligation is payable to the compact 
commission, the account for which it is to be paid;
    (b) If a handler fails or refuses, with respect to any obligation 
under the pricing regulation, to make available to the compact 
commission all records required by the pricing regulation to be made 
available, the compact commission may notify the handler in writing, 
within the two year period provided for in paragraph (a) of this 
section, of such failure or refusal. If the compact commission so 
notifies a handler, the said two year period with respect to such 
obligation shall not begin to run until the first day of the month 
following the month during which all such records pertaining to such 
obligation are made available to the compact commission;
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, a handler's obligation under the pricing regulation to pay 
money shall not be terminated with respect to any transaction involving 
fraud or willful concealment of a fact, material to the obligation, on 
the part of the handler against whom the obligation is sought to be 
imposed; and
    (d) Unless the handler files a petition to the compact commission to 
commence litigation within the applicable two year period indicated 
below, the obligation of the compact commission:
    (1) To pay a handler any money which such handler claims to be due 
him under the terms of the pricing regulation shall terminate two years 
after the end of the month during which the fluid milk product involved 
in the claim were received; or
    (2) To refund any payment made by a handler (including a deduction 
or offset by the compact commission) shall terminate two years after the 
end of the month during which payment was made by the handler.

[[Page 230]]

stops receiving milk at his pool plant. Such information shall include 
the applicable date, the producer-member's post office address and farm 
location, and, if known, the plant at which his milk was previously

the milk is picked up at the farm a receipt indicating the measurement 
and the equivalent pounds of milk received;
    (b) Whenever he receives milk from the producer on a basis other 
than farm bulk tank measurements, the handler shall give the producer 
within three (3) days after receipt of the milk a written notice of the

Sec. 1306.3  Computation of basic over-order producer price.

    The compact commission shall compute the basic over-order producer 
price per hundredweight applicable to milk received at plants as 
follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1306.1 and Sec. 1306.2 of this chapter for all handlers from whom 
the compact commission has received at the Compact Commission's office 
prior to the 9th day after the end of the month the reports for the 
month prescribed in Sec. 1303.1 and the payments for the preceding month 
required under Sec. 1307.3 (a) of this chapter.
    (b) Subtract 3% of the total value computed pursuant to paragraph 
(a) above for the purpose of retaining a reserve for WIC pursuant to the 
Formal Agreement for reimbursement of WIC Program costs entered into 
between the Commission and the six New England State WIC Program 
Directors, as approved by the Food and Consumer Service of the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA);
    (c) In any month when the average percentage increase in production 
in the regulated area comes within 0.25 of the average percentage 
increase in production for the nation, subtract from the total value 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) above, for the purpose of retaining a 
reserve, an amount estimated by the Commission in consultation with the 
USDA for anticipated costs to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC) at the end of its fiscal year for any surplus milk purchases. 
Should those funds not be needed because no surplus purchases were made 
by the CCC at the end of its fiscal year, it is to be disbursed as 
follows:
    (1) Any producer who has received payment from a handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1307.4 shall become eligible to receive a pro rata disbursement by 
submitting to the Commission documentation that the producer did not 
increase production of milk during and after the month on which the 
regional rate of production increase met or exceeded the national rate 
of production increase, as compared to the same period in the preceeding 
year. Such documentation shall be filed with the Commission not later 
than 45 days after the end of the fiscal year.
    (2) The Commission shall calculate the amount of refund to be 
provided to each eligible producer by taking into account the total 
amount of retained proceeds, the total production of milk by all 
producers eligible for refunds, and the total amount of production by 
each eligible producer.
    (d) Beginning with the August 1998 pool, subtract from the total 
value computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, an amount 
estimated by the Commission for the purpose of retaining a reserve for 
payment of obligations pursuant to Sec. 1301.13(e) of this chapter. 
Surplus funds from this reserve shall be returned to the producer-
settlement fund.
    (e) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance of the producer-settlement fund at the close of business on the 
8th day after the end of the month;
    (f) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:

[[Page 235]]

    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk;
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1306.2(a); and
    (g) Subtract not less than four (4) cents nor more than five (5) 
cents for the purpose of retaining a cash balance in the producer-
settlement fund. The result shall be the basic over-order producer price 
for the month.

    (b) On or before the 20th day after the end of the month, the 
compact commission shall pay to each handler the handler's producer-
settlement fund credit for the month as determined under Sec. 1307.2(b).

uniformly such payments and shall complete them as soon as the funds are 
available.


<R05>
Sec. 1307.4  Payments to producers.

    (a) On or before the 20th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall make payment to each producer for the milk received from 
him during the month at not less than the basic over-order producer 
price per hundredweight computer under Sec. 1306.3. If the handler has 
not received full payment for the compact commission under 
Sec. 1307.3(b) by the date payments are due under this paragraph, he may 
reduce pro rata his payments to producers by an amount not to exceed 
such underpayment. Such payments shall be completed after receipt of the 
balance due from the compact commission by the next following date for 
making payments under this paragraph.
    (b) If the handler's net payment to a producer is for an amount less 
than the total amount due the producer under this section, the burden 
shall rest upon the handler to prove to the compact commission that each 
deduction from the total amount due is properly authorized and properly 
chargeable to the producer.
    (c) In making payment to producers under paragraph (b) of this 
section for milk diverted from a pool plant the handler may elect to pay 
such producers at the price of the plant from which the milk was 
diverted, if the resulting net payment to each producer is not less than 
the otherwise required under this section and the rate of payment and 
the deduction shown on the statement required to be furnished under 
Sec. 1307.6 are those used in computing the payment.
    (d) If a handler claims that the required payment cannot be made 
because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, such payment 
shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the 
handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, 
or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is 
later established, the compact commission shall make such payment from 
the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant, 
as the case may be.
    (e) If not later than the date when such payment is required to be 
made, legal proceedings have been instituted by the handler for the 
purpose of administrative or judicial review of the compact commission 
findings upon verification as provided above such payment shall be made 
to the producer-settlement fund and shall be held in reserve until such 
time as the above-mentioned proceedings have been completed or until the 
handler submits proof to the compact commission that the required 
payment has been made to the producer in which latter event the payment 
shall be refunded to the handler.
    (f) At a partially regulated plant each handler shall make payments, 
on a pro rata basis, to all producers and dairy farmers for milk 
(excluding diverted pool producer milk) received from them during the 
month, the payment received pursuant to Sec. 1307.3(b).

other than those establishing the Compact over-order price, are in the

oral hearing. In making this determination, the panel shall consider:
    (i) The nature of the petition before them;

documents, reports, answers, records, accounts, papers or other data and

may be embodied in a single decision.
    (5) Grant or deny petitioner's request for the establishment of an 
escrow account, if such request has been made. The panel shall deny such 
a request only if it has otherwise ensured adequate protection to the 
handler with respect to the payments of sums due and challenged in the 
petition.
    (c) The panel shall promptly notify petitioner by certified mail of 
the results of its deliberations under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. The panel's notice shall include a concise statement of the 
basis for its decisions under those paragraphs. The notice shall include 
a time and place for an oral hearing, if any, and the deadline for the 
submission of any additional information required by the panel. The 
notice shall also set forth the date by

[[Page 246]]

which the panel will issue its proposed findings of fact, conclusions 
and decision, as computed under paragraph (g) of this section. If a 
request has been made for the establishment of an escrow account and 
such request has been granted, the notice shall also include a procedure 
for the making of escrow payments. If such request is denied, any 
payments made and held in escrow may be released for disbursement by the 
Commission.
    (d) The panel may take official notice of such matters as are 
judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other 
matter of technical, scientific or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That interested parties shall be given adequate 
notice of matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to 
show that such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.
    (e) The panel shall:
    (1) Exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence which is immaterial, 
irrelevant or unduly repetitious: Provided, That interested parties 
shall be given adequate notice of such exclusion and an opportunity to 
show that such evidence has been erroneously excluded.
    (2) Not discuss ex parte the merits of the proceeding with any 
person who is or who has been connected in any manner with the 
proceeding.

and place determined by the panel.
    (2) Testimony presented at the hearing shall be:
    (i) Upon oath or affirmation administered by the panel and subject 
to reasonable cross examination; and

    (c) The percentage share of the interest in a limited partnership, 
limited liability partnership, limited liability company, corporation,

stock or other unit of ownership, including the various rights and 
privileges that are attributed to each such class.

personal management must be at least 50 percent;
    (c) The trust has provided a tax identification number of the trust 
unless the trust is a revocable trust and the grantor is the sole income 
beneficiary; and

    (d) The trust has provided a copy of the trust agreement to the 
county committee unless the trust is a revocable trust.

Sec. 1400.206  Estates.

    (a) For 2 program years after the program year in which an 
individual dies the individual's estate shall be considered to be 
actively engaged in farming if:
    (1) The estate makes a significant contribution of either:
    (i) Capital, equipment, or land; or
    (ii) A combination of capital, equipment, or land; and
    (2) The personal representative or heirs of the estate collectively 
make a significant contribution of either:
    (i) Active personal labor or active personal management; or
    (ii) A combination of active personal labor and active personal 
management.
    (b) After the period set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
deceased individual's estate shall not be considered to be actively 
engaged in farming unless, on a case by case basis, the Deputy 
Administrator determines that the estate has not been settled primarily 
for the purpose of obtaining program payments.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.207  Landowners.

    A person who is a landowner, including landowners with an undivided 
interest in land, making a significant contribution of owned land to the 
farming operation, shall be considered to be actively engaged in farming 
with respect to such owned land, if the landowner receives rent or 
income for such use of the land based on the land's production or the 
operation's operating results. A landowner also includes a member of a 
joint operation if the joint operation holds title to land in the name 
of the joint operation and if the joint operation or its members submit 
adequate documentation to determine that, upon dissolution of the joint 
operation, the title to the land owned by the joint operation will 
revert to such member of such joint operation.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.208  Family members.

    With respect to a farming operation conducted by persons, a majority 
of whom are individuals who are family members, an adult family member 
who makes a significant contribution of active personal management, 
active personal labor, or a combination of active personal labor and 
active personal management shall be considered to be actively engaged in 
farming.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.209  Sharecroppers.

    A sharecropper who makes a significant contribution of active 
personal labor to the farming operation shall be considered to be 
actively engaged in farming.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.210  Deceased and incapacitated individuals.

    The determining authority shall take into consideration the 
circumstances involving individuals who have died or become 
incapacitated during the program year or fiscal year, as applicable. If 
the individual dies or is incapacitated before a determination is made 
that the individual is ``actively engaged in farming,'' the 
representative of the deceased individual's estate or the incapacitated 
individual, or other person if necessary, must provide the determining 
authority information to verify that such individual did make a 
conscious effort to and would have been determined to be actively 
engaged in farming if not for the individual's death or incapacitation. 
If the individual dies or is incapacitated after being determined to be 
``actively engaged in farming,'' the determining authority shall allow 
such determination to be in effect for that program year or fiscal year, 
as applicable. However, the following year such individual or the 
individual's estate must meet all necessary requirements in order to be 
determined to be ``actively engaged in farming'' for that year.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.211  Persons not considered to be actively engaged in farming.

    An individual or entity who does not satisfy all of the provisions 
of Secs. 1400.202 through 1400.210 and a landowner who rents land to a 
farming operation for cash or a crop share guaranteed as to the amount 
of the commodity shall not be considered to be actively engaged in 
farming.

[[Page 264]]


<R05>
Sec. 1400.212  Hybrid seed producers.

    The existence of a hybrid seed contract for a producer shall not be 
taken into account when making an actively engaged in farming 
determination with respect to such producer. However, such producer must 
satisfy all other applicable provisions of this part.


<R04>
                      Subpart D--Permitted Entities


<R05>
Sec. 1400.301  Limitation on the number of entities through which an individual or entity may receive a payment and required notification.

    (a) An individual may receive a payment under a program specified in 
Sec. 1400.1(a) either directly or indirectly from no more than three 
permitted entities. An individual who receives such a payment shall 
notify the county committee in the county in which such individual 
maintains a farming operation whether or not the farming operation is to 
be considered a permitted entity. An individual may only receive such 
payments as a result of a farming operation conducted by:
    (1) The individual and by no more than two entities in which the 
individual holds a substantial beneficial interest; or
    (2) No more than three entities in which the individual holds a 
substantial beneficial interest.
    (b) Except for entities specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
each entity entering into a contract or agreement under a program 
specified in Sec. 1400.1(a) shall, by the date the contract or agreement 
is submitted to the county committee, notify in writing:
    (1) Each individual or other entity that acquires or holds an 
interest in such entity of the requirements and limitations provided in 
this part; and
    (2) The county committee of the name and social security number of 
each individual and the name and taxpayer identification number of each 
entity that holds or acquires a substantial beneficial interest in such 
entity.
    (c) Entities shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this section if, as determined by the Deputy Administrator:
    (1) Because of the number of members of such entity no member is 
likely to have a substantial beneficial interest in such entity; and
    (2) Such provisions would cause undue financial hardship on such 
entity.
    (d)(1) An individual or entity that holds a substantial beneficial 
interest in more than the number of permitted entities specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section for which a contract or agreement has been 
submitted to the county committee shall notify the county committee in 
writing, in each county in which they conduct a farming operation, of 
those entities that shall be considered as permitted entities by a date 
as determined by the Deputy Administrator following the date the 
contract or agreement was submitted to the county committee.
    (2) The remaining entities in which the individual or entity holds a 
substantial beneficial interest shall be notified that such entity is 
subject to reductions in the payments earned by the remaining entity. 
Such a reduction shall be made in an amount that bears the same 
relationship to the full payment that the individual's interest in the 
entity bears to all interests in the entity. The remaining entity's 
members shall have the opportunity to adjust among themselves their 
proportionate shares of the program benefits in the designated entity or 
entities before such reductions are made.
    (e) If an individual or entity fails to make such a notification as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section, all entities in which the 
individual or entity holds a substantial beneficial interest shall be 
subject to a reduction in payments in the manner specified in paragraph 
(d)(2).


<R04>
                      Subpart E--Cash Rent Tenants


<R05>
Sec. 1400.401  Eligibility.

    (a) Any tenant that is actively engaged in farming in accordance 
with the provisions of subpart C and conducts a farming operation in 
which the tenant rents the land for cash, for a crop share guaranteed as 
to the amount of the commodity, or by any arrangement in which the 
tenant does not compensate the landlord by cash or a crop share, and 
receives benefits,

[[Page 265]]

with respect to such land under a program specified in Sec. 1400.1(a) 
shall be ineligible to receive any payment with respect to such cash-
rented land unless the tenant makes a significant contribution to the 
farming operation of:
    (1) Active personal labor; or
    (2) Active personal management and equipment. If such equipment is 
leased by the tenant from:
    (i) The landlord, the lease must reflect the fair market value of 
the equipment leased; and
    (ii) The same individual or entity that is providing hired labor to 
the farming operation, the contracts for the lease of the equipment and 
for the hired labor must be two separate contracts that reflect the fair 
market value of the leased equipment and the hired labor and the tenant 
must exercise complete control over the use of a significant amount of 
the equipment during the current crop year.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R04>
                       Subpart F-- Foreign Persons


<R05>
Sec. 1400.501  Eligibility.

    (a) Any person who is not a citizen of the United States or a lawful 
alien shall be ineligible to receive payments, loans and benefits, with 
respect to any commodity produced, or land set aside from production, on 
a farm that is owned or operated by such person unless such person is an 
individual who is providing land, capital, and a substantial amount of 
active personal labor on such farm.
    (b)(1) A corporation or other entity shall be ineligible to receive 
payments, loan, and benefits if more than 10 percent of the beneficial 
ownership of the entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the 
United States or lawful aliens unless each foreign individual who is a 
stockholder or other type of member provides a substantial amount of 
active personal labor in the production of crops on a farm owned or 
operated by such an entity. However, upon the written request of the 
entity, the Deputy Administrator may make payments in an amount 
determined by the Deputy Administrator to be representative of the 
percentage interest of the entity that is owned by citizens of the 
United States and lawful aliens or foreign stockholders or other type of 
member who provide a significant contribution of active personal labor 
in the production of crops on a farm owned or operated by such entity.
    (2) In determining whether more than 10 percent of the beneficial 
ownership of an entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the 
United States or by lawful aliens, the beneficial ownership interest 
shall be the higher of the amount of such interest on:
    (i) The date the applicable program contract or agreement is 
executed by the entity; or
    (ii) Any other date prior to the final harvest date that is 
determined and announced by the Deputy Administrator to be normal in the 
area for the applicable program crop.
    (3) A corporation or other entity shall inform the county committee 
of any increase in such ownership that occurs after the applicable 
program contract or agreement is executed.
    (4) In the event of an increase in such ownership after a payment, 
loan, or benefit has been made, the entity shall refund such payment, 
loan, or benefit.
    (5) Where there is only one class of stock or other similar unit of 
ownership, an individual's or entity's percentage share of the limited 
partnership, corporation or other similar entity shall be based upon the 
outstanding shares of stock or other similar unit of ownership held by 
the individual or entity and compared to the total outstanding shares of 
stock or other similar unit of ownership. If the limited partnership, 
corporation or other similar entity has more than one class of stock or 
other unit of ownership, the percentage share of the limited 
partnership, corporation or other similar entity owned by an individual 
or entity shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on the basis 
of market quotations. If market quotations are lacking or are too scarce 
to be recognized, such percentage share shall be determined by the 
Deputy Administrator on the basis of all relevant factors affecting the 
fair market value of such stock or other unit of ownership, including 
the various rights and privileges that are attributed to each such 
class.

[[Page 266]]

    (c) A citizen of the United States, lawful alien, or entity that is 
not subject to this part who is in lawful possession, through a lease or 
otherwise, of a farm owned by an individual or entity who is subject to 
this part may receive a payment, loan, and benefit without regard to 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1400.502  Notification.

    (a) Any entity, whether foreign or domestic, that executes a program 
contract or agreement under which a payment, loan, or benefit may be 
available must provide written notification to the county committee in 
the county where the entity conducts its farming operation if:
    (1) Any individual, group of individuals, entity, or group of 
entities holds more than a 10 percent beneficial interest in such 
entity; and
    (2) Such individual, group of individuals, entity, or group of 
entities, in accordance with Sec. 1400.501, are ineligible to receive a 
payment, loan and benefit.
    (b) Such written notification must, if known, include the name and 
social security number or taxpayer identification number of such 
individual or entity and of all individuals and entities that hold a 
beneficial interest.
    (c) The failure of the entity to provide this information will 
result in the ineligibility of the entity to receive any payment, loan, 
or benefit.

<R05>
Sec. 1401.1  Applicability.

    This part shall be applicable to payments and loans made in 
accordance with the programs administered by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) or the Farm Service Agency (FSA) as determined and 
announced by the Secretary of Agriculture or a designee of the 
Secretary. The definitions of the terms applicable to 7 CFR part 713 set 
forth at Sec. 713.3 also shall be applicable to this part, except that 
the term ``commodity'' shall mean any agricultural commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.2  Payments in lieu of cash payments.

    (a) CCC will, in accordance with applicable program provisions, make 
payments in a form other than in cash to persons who otherwise are 
eligible to receive a cash payment from CCC. Further, subject only to 
statutory prohibition and notwithstanding any provisions of the contract 
to participate in a program administered by CCC or FSA, CCC may: at its 
option, make payments in a form other than in cash.
    (b) As determined by CCC, payments in a form other than in cash may 
be made in the following manner:
    (1) By delivery of a commodity to a person at a warehouse or other 
similar facility;
    (2) By transfer of negotiable warehouse receipts;
    (3) By the issuance of certificates which CCC shall redeem in 
accordance with this part;
    (4) By the acquisition and use of commodities pledged as collateral 
for CCC price support loans;
    (5) By the use of commodities owned by CCC; and
    (6) By such other methods as CCC determines appropriate, including 
methods to enable the producer to receive payments in order to assure 
that the producer receives the same total return as if the payments had 
been made in cash.
    (c) The value of the payments made in any manner set forth in 
paragraph (b) shall be determined by CCC.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, CCC may, with 
respect to producers who are members of a cooperative marketing 
association

[[Page 267]]

which has been determined in accordance with part 1425 of this title to 
be eligible to receive price support on behalf of its producer-members, 
enter into agreements with such producers and such cooperatives to 
facilitate the making of payments to such producers. Such agreements may 
include a provision which allows a producer to make available for the 
use of the cooperative the value of the non-cash payment which would 
otherwise be made to the producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.3  Payments to persons with outstanding CCC loans.

    (a) Persons with outstanding CCC loans who are eligible to receive 
payments from CCC, including a person authorized to receive a payment on 
behalf of another person, may be required to liquidate such loans in 
accordance with this section in order to be eligible to receive a 
payment authorized by Sec. 1470.2.
    (b) A person with an outstanding CCC loan must, unless otherwise 
agreed upon by the person and CCC, redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of 
the commodity pledged as collateral for a CCC loan, as determined by 
CCC, in an amount equal in value to the value of the payment which would 
otherwise be made to such person. If the person has more than one 
outstanding CCC loan, CCC may, by contract or otherwise, prescribe which 
loan collateral the person shall be required to redeem in order to 
receive payment. The purchase price shall be equal to the cost of 
liquidating the loan or the portion of the loan for which the quantity 
of the commodity sold to CCC is pledged as collateral, except that, in 
the case of a special producer storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve 
loan, the purchase price will not include the amount of any unearned 
advance storage payments received with respect to the redeemed 
collateral. After redemption and the subsequent sale to CCC of the 
commodity pledged as collateral for such CCC loan, CCC shall make 
available to the person a like quantity of the commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.4  Commodity certificates.

    (a) General. CCC may issue commodity certificates as a form of 
payment. Commodity certificates will bear a dollar denomination. Such 
certificate may be transferred, exchanged for the inventory of CCC 
(including the receipt in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section 
of loan collateral by a person to whom a loan secured by such collateral 
is made): or exchanged for cash, as provided for in this section. 
Commodity certificates shall be subject to the provisions of this part, 
and to any terms, conditions and restrictions provided on the 
certificate, which are incorporated by reference herein.
    (b) Liens, encumbrances, and State law. (1) The provisions of this 
section or the commodity certificates shall take precedence over any 
state statutory or regulatory provisions which are inconsistent with the 
provisions of this section or with the provisions of the commodity 
certificates.
    (2) Commodity certificates shall not be subject to any lien, 
encumbrance, or other claim or security interest, except that of an 
agency of the United States Government arising specifically under 
Federal statute.
    (3) The provisions of this paragraph (b) shall apply without regard 
to the identity of the holder of the certificate.
    (c) Transferability. Any person may transfer a commodity certificate 
to any other person. However, any such transfer must be in the full 
amount of the certificate, and can be effected only by restrictive 
endorsement on the back of the certificate, showing the name of the 
transferee and the date of the transfer, and signed by the transferor. 
CCC will not honor any certificate bearing any endorsement to ``bearer'' 
or any other nonrestrictive endorsement, or otherwise transferred in a 
manner contrary to the regulations contained in this section. The person 
who submits a commodity certificate to CCC shall endorse the certificate 
to CCC.
    (d) Exchange of commodity certificate for CCC-owned commodities--(1) 
General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity 
certificate may exchange such certificate, by itself or together with 
other commodity certificates, for such commodities as are made available 
by

[[Page 268]]

CCC by endorsing and submitting the certificate to CCC. If a person 
submits commodity certificates for exchange in order that the person 
would be eligible to receive a quantity of a commodity which includes 
less than an entire unit in which the commodity is stored (e.g., less 
than an entire bale of cotton or an entire barrel of honey): (i) Such 
person may forfeit the partial unit of the commodity to CCC, or (ii) CCC 
may issue a check to such person for the partial unit of the commodity 
or permit such person to purchase the remainder of such unit at a price 
determined by CCC. A person may obtain information regarding commodities 
available for exchange and the procedure for exchange from Kansas City 
Commodity Office, FSA-USDA, Kansas City, MO 64141-0205.
    (2) Minimum quantities. A holder of an amount of commodity 
certificates sufficient to acquire a carload lot, or other quantity as 
may be determined by CCC, may present such amount for exchange at any 
time on or before the expiration date of such certificates. A holder who 
is permitted to exchange the certificate for CCC-owned commodities but 
who does not possess commodity certificates in the amount specified in 
the preceding sentence may, not to exceed once during a calendar month, 
submit such certificates to CCC. CCC will, at CCC's option, pay such 
holder by check in the amount of the certificate or transfer to such 
holder title to commodities owned by CCC.
    (3) CCC-owned commodities stored by a person who submits commodity 
certificates to CCC. CCC may require or permit holders of commodity 
certificates to exchange such certificates for commodities owned by CCC 
which are stored by such holder, without making such commodities or 
kinds of commodities available to other holders of commodity 
certificates.
    (4) Valuation. Except as otherwise may be announced by CCC, CCC will 
determine the value of CCC-owned commodities made available to holders 
of commodity certificates.
    (5) Transfer of title. Title to commodities owned by CCC which are 
transferred to a person who submits commodity certificates to CCC shall 
be transferred in store, except as may be determined and announced by 
CCC. The person who submits certificates to CCC shall be responsible for 
all costs incurred in transferring title to the commodity, except as 
specifically provided by CCC. The transfer of title to such commodities 
shall occur without regard to any State law or any claim of lien against 
the commodity or proceeds thereof which may be asserted by any creditor 
except agencies of the U.S. Government whose lien arises specifically 
under Federal statute.
    (6) Expiration date. CCC may, at its option, discount or refuse to 
accept any commodity certificate presented for exchange after the 
expiration date stated on the certificate.
    (e) Use of commodity certificates to receive loan collateral--(1) 
General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity 
certificate may use such certificate to receive commodities pledged as 
collateral for CCC loans made to such person, at any time on or before 
the expiration date stated on the certificate. A holder of a commodity 
certificate who wishes to receive a quantity of a commodity pledged by 
such person as collateral for a CCC loan in exchange for a certificate 
shall redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of the commodity equal in value 
to the dollar denomination of the certificate, as determined by CCC. The 
purchase price shall be equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the 
portion of the loan for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC 
is pledged as collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer 
storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not 
include the amount of any unearned advanced storage payments received 
with respect to the redeemed loan collateral. Upon submission of the 
certificate, which is endorsed to CCC, to the county FSA office which 
issued the loan, the holder of a commodity certificate will receive the 
quantity of the commodity which has been sold to CCC. Except as 
otherwise determined by CCC, if the holder of such certificate does not 
have commodities pledged as collateral for CCC

[[Page 269]]

loans equal in value to the dollar denomination of the certificate, as 
determined by CCC, CCC will, at CCC's option and after the producer has 
submitted the certificate, pay the difference to the person by check or 
in the form of a new commodity certificate.
    (2) Ineligible commodities. No person may use a commodity 
certificate to receive a quantity of tobacco, peanuts, or extra long 
staple cotton pledged as collateral for a CCC loan. No person may, 
before August 1, 1986, use a commodity certificate to receive a quantity 
of upland cotton pledged as collateral for a CCC loan.
    (f) Cash redemption start date. (1) The person to whom a generic 
certificate is issued which has a date entered in block D may submit 
such certificate, endorsed to CCC, at the issuing county FSA office for 
payment by check in the amount of the certificate on or after the date 
entered in block D through the expiration date of the certificate. Such 
person may not exchange the certificate for commodities owned by CCC, 
except as otherwise agreed upon between such person and CCC.
    (2) The person to whom a generic certificate is issued which has an 
entry of ``S/H'' in block D may exchange such certificate for 
commodities owned by CCC.
    (3) The person to whom a commodity specific certificate is issued 
which has a date entered in block D may submit such certificate, 
endorsed to CCC, to the Kansas City Commodity Office for the specific 
commodity entered in block C beginning on the date entered in block D 
through the expiration date of the certificate. Such certificate may not 
be exchanged for cash, except as otherwise agreed on by CCC.
    (4) All other certificates may be transferred and exchanged as 
determined and announced by CCC.
    (g) ``Generic'' and commodity-specific commodity certificates--(1) 
General. If a commodity certificate indicates that it is a ``generic'' 
certificate, such certificate may, subject to the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, be exchanged for any 
commodity made available by CCC or, as appropriate, used to receive a 
quantity of any commodity which serves as collateral for a CCC loan. If 
a certificate is not a ``generic certificate'', such certificate may be 
exchanged for the commodity specified on the certificate, except as may 
be determined and announced by CCC.
    (2) Cotton program payments. Certificates issued as payments under 
the 1991 through 1995 upland cotton program, including payments issued 
in accordance with section 103B(a)(5)(B) of the Agricultural Act of 
1949, may be exchanged for CCC-owned upland cotton only during such 
times as determined and announced by CCC.
    (3) Commodities not available in CCC inventory. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this section, if a person submits a commodity 
specific certificate to CCC in exchange for a quantity of such commodity 
and CCC determines it is not possible to make such commodity available, 
CCC may: (i) Require such person to exchange the commodity specific 
certificate for a generic certificate; or (ii) refuse to accept 
submission of such certificate until CCC is able to make available a 
quantity of the commodity specified on such certificate.
    (h) CCC, at its option, may discount or refuse to accept any 
certificate made, transferred, or submitted in violation of this 
section.
    (i) Interest. With respect to producers who receive commodity 
certificates in accordance with the wheat, feed grains, upland cotton 
and rice price support and production adjustment programs authorized by 
parts 1413 and 1421 of this title, a producer to whom the certificate is 
issued who exchanges such a certificate with CCC for cash in accordance 
with subsection (f) of this section shall receive interest with respect 
to such certificate for a 150 day period. Such interest shall be the 
rate of interest determined in accordance with part 1405 of this Title 
which is in effect on the date the certificate is issued.

Sec. 1401.5  In kind payments.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of Secs. 1470.2 and 1470.3, CCC may 
make payments in the form of commodities. Quantities of commodities made 
available as payment shall be based upon

[[Page 270]]

the value of the commodity, as determined by CCC. Such quantity may be 
adjusted by CCC to reflect the location, quality, and other similar 
factors which CCC determines to affect the value of the commodity.
    (b) The transfer of title to commodities made available in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be in store, except 
as determined by CCC, and shall be made without regard to any State law 
or any claim of lien against the commodity, or proceeds thereof, which 
may be asserted by any creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government 
whose lien arises specifically under Federal statute. The recipient of 
such commodities shall be responsible for all costs incurred in 
transferring title to the commodity, except as specifically provided by 
CCC.


<R05>

    Except as CCC may provide in accordance with Sec. 1403.6, CCC shall 
collect debts owed to the Government, including applicable interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, in full, whenever feasible whether 
the debt is being collected by administrative offset or by another

arrangement

will be considered unless the debtor submits a certified financial 
statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and 
expenses. The financial statement shall not be required to be submitted 
sooner than 15 business days following its request by CCC.
    (c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and may 
require the payment of interest at the late payment interest rate in 
effect on the date such agreement is executed. The installment agreement 
shall specify all the terms of the arrangement and include provision for 
accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. A confession of 
judgment provision may be included in the agreement.
    (d) CCC may deem a repayment plan to be abrogated if the debtor 
fails to comply with its terms.
    (e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information 
discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered, the debtor 
may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by 
executing a security agreement and financing agreement which provides 
CCC a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full.
    (f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to CCC, CCC may allow the 
debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary installment payment 
is to be applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a 
voluntary installment or partial payment, the payment will be applied to 
such debts as determined by CCC.


<R05>

other payments due by CCC;
    (4) Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by 
administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by 
statute; and
    (5) IRS Notices of Levy which shall be honored in accordance with 
IRS statutes and regulations.
    (b) Debts due CCC may be collected by administrative offset from 
amounts payable by CCC when:
    (1) The debtor has been provided written notification of the basis 
and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make 
payment. Such written notification and opportunity includes notice of 
the right to pursue an administrative appeal in accordance with part 780 
of this Title or any other applicable appeal procedures, if not 
previously provided;
    (2) The debtor has been provided an opportunity to request to

payable by CCC:
    (1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or
    (2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of CCC.
    (d) Debts due CCC from carriers for overcharges shall be offset 
against amounts due such carriers under freight bills involving

    (1) The carrier, without reasonable justification, has declined 
payment of the debt or has failed to pay the debt after being given a 
reasonable opportunity to make payment; and
    (2) The period of limitation prescribed at 49 U.S.C. 11706(f) has

justification or has ignored the claim; and
    (3) The period of limitation prescribed at 49 U.S.C. 11707(e) has

applicable period of limitation has run may be offset against any 
amounts owing by CCC to the carrier which are subject to a defense of 
limitation.
    (g) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of 
a contract or a violation of CCC program requirements, and offset is 
considered necessary by CCC to protect the financial interests of the 
Government.
    (h) In the case of any procurement contract with CCC which provides 
for invoicing at the time of shipment with delivery to be made at 
designated destination points when:
    (1) Payment is made to the contractor prior to receipt of evidence 
of delivery, and
    (2) CCC thereafter determines that the Contractor is indebted to CCC 
because of losses sustained from shortage, damage to or deterioration of 
the commodity while in transit and prior to delivery, CCC may offset 
such indebtedness against amounts due and payable to the Contractor 
under any other contract with CCC providing the Contractor has not 
assigned the proceeds of such contract in accordance with part 1404 of 
this chapter.
    (i) CCC may effect administrative offset against a payment to be 
made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by 
(b)(1-3) of this section if:
    (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice CCC's 
ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of those procedures.
    (j)(1) Debts due any agency other than CCC shall be offset against 
amounts payable by CCC to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government 
has submitted a written request for offset which is mailed or hand-
delivered to the appropriate FSA State office, Kansas City Management 
Office or Kansas City Commodity Office. Such written request must:

interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest, if any, shall

to be offset shall not exceed the principal sum owed by the debtor, plus 
interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment 
interest, penalties and administrative costs that have been assessed;
    (v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the 
debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order of the bankruptcy 
court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and
    (vi) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact 
person within the agency and the address to which payment should be 
sent.
    (2) Unless prohibited by law, the head of an agency, or a designee, 
may defer or subordinate in whole or in part the right of the agency to 
recover through offset all or part of any indebtedness to such agency, 
or may withdraw a request for offset. Notice of such action must be sent 
to the appropriate FSA office.
    (k)(1) After CCC has complied with the provisions of this part, CCC 
may request other agencies of the Government to offset amounts payable 
by them to persons indebted to CCC.

[[Page 277]]

    (2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the 
provisions at Sec. 1403.18 shall apply.

priority without regard to the date of the request for such collection:
    (i) Debts to CCC.
    (ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by CCC.
    (iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by CCC.
    (2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, CCC 
may, at its discretion, deviate from the usual order of priority in 
applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered 
to be in the Government's best interest. Such decision shall be made by 
CCC based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
    (m)(1) No amounts payable to a debtor by CCC shall be paid to an 
assignee until there have been collected any amounts owed by the debtor 
except as provided in this subsection.
    (2) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
Chapter by execution of Form CCC-36 shall be subject to offset for any 
debt owed to CCC or FSA without regard to the date notice of assignment 
was accepted by CCC or FSA.
    (3) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
Chapter by execution of Form CCC-252 shall be offset:
    (i) Against any debt of the assignor entered on the debt record of 
the applicable FSA office prior to the filing of such form with CCC or 
FSA, or
    (ii) At anytime, regardless of the date of filing of such form with 
CCC or FSA, if the debt which is the basis for the offset arises under 
the same contract under which the payment is earned by the assignor.
    (4) With respect to all other Federal agencies, offset shall be made 
of any amounts due any other Federal agency which are entered on the 
debt record of the appropriate FSA office prior to the date the notice 
of assignment was accepted by CCC or FSA.
    (5) Any amount due and payable to the assignor which remains after 
deduction of amounts paid to the assignee shall be available for offset.
    (n) Amounts recovered by offset for CCC and FSA debts but later 
found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.
    (o) The debtor shall be notified whenever any offset action has been 
taken.
    (p) Offsets made pursuant to this section shall not deprive a debtor 
of any right he might otherwise have to contest the debt involved in the 
offset action either by administrative appeal or by legal action.
    (q) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be 
taken:
    (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity 
which the debtor participates in, either directly or indirectly, as 
determined by CCC.
    (2) When CCC determines that the debtor has established an entity, 
or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other 
manner, their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the 
claim or debt.
    (r) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated 
amount of the debt, including interest, administrative charges, and 
penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger 
specified amount be offset.
    (s) Offset action will not be taken against payments when:
    (1) The payment represents loan or purchase proceeds for a commodity 
which is subject to the rights of the holder of a prior valid 
enforceable lien. However, any amount that exceeds the amount of the 
prior lien shall be available for offset.
    (2) A debt has been discharged as provided in Sec. 1403.15.
    (3) The amount payable to the debtor is used to satisfy a prior lien 
on property pledged as collateral for a CCC loan or sold to CCC. 
However, any amount exceeding the amount of the prior lien shall be 
available for offset.
    (4) CCC determines such action will unduly interfere with the 
administration of a CCC or FSA program.
    (5) The debt has been delinquent for more than ten years or legal 
action to enforce the debt due CCC is barred by an applicable period of 
limitation, whichever is later.
    (t)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 1403.4, with respect to debts which are

[[Page 278]]

based upon an unsettled CCC loan, offset action may be taken when the 
debtor has been:
    (i) Provided written notification of the maturity date of the loan 
and the debtor has not repaid the loan by the maturity date or, in the 
case of a nonrecourse price support loan, has not repaid the loan or 
forfeited the loan collateral to CCC by the date specified by CCC;
    (ii) Notified of CCC's intent to establish an account on a debt 
record 30 days after the maturity date, or other applicable period of 
time, if the loan is not settled in accordance with the loan agreement;
    (iii) Notified of the right to pursue an administrative appeal in 
accordance with part 780 of this title if such an opportunity has not 
been previously provided;
    (iv) Provided an opportunity to inspect and copy CCC records related 
to the debt; and
    (v) Notified in writing that the debt may be collected by 
administrative offset if the loan is not repaid or, with respect to 
nonrecourse loans only, settled through forfeiture of the loan 
collateral.
    (2) After a claim has been established by CCC with respect to a loan 
which has not been settled by the date specified in the loan agreement:
    (i) In the event CCC takes possession of the collateral which is 
security for a nonrecourse of recourse loan made in accordance with 
parts 1421, 1427, 1434, or 1435 of this chapter, the value of such loan 
collateral shall be determined by CCC in accordance with the provisions 
of such parts which are used to determine the settlement value of the 
collateral. The value of such collateral shall be applied to the claim. 
Any amount remaining due on the claim must be paid by the debtor.
    (ii) In the event CCC takes possession of the collateral which is 
the security for any other loan, the value of such collateral, as 
determined by CCC, less any costs incurred by CCC in taking possession 
and disposing of the collateral, shall be applied to the claim. Any 
amount remaining due on the claim must be paid by the debtor.

<R05>
Sec. 1403.8  Withholding.

    (a) Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an 
applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable to a debtor 
by CCC to ensure that the interests of CCC and the United States will be 
protected as provided in this section.
    (b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of CCC or the 
United States only if CCC determines that:
    (1) There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of 
program requirements and the withholding action is considered necessary 
to protect the financial interests of CCC;
    (2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil 
frauds statutes and criminal prosecution or civil frauds action is of 
primary importance to program operations of CCC;
    (3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will 
be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor are not withheld;
    (4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a 
judgment on the claim of CCC;
    (5) The facts available to CCC are insufficient to determine the 
amount to be offset or the proper payee;
    (6) A judgment on a claim of CCC has been obtained; or
    (7) Such action has been requested by the Department of Justice.
    (c) Except for debts due CCC or FSA, withholding action by CCC on 
amounts payable to debtors of other Government agencies may not be made 
unless requested by the Department of Justice.

<R05>
Sec. 1403.9  Late payment interest and administrative charges.

    (a)(1) The provisions of this section are applicable to all persons 
whose debt to CCC becomes delinquent after January 1, 1990, unless the 
debtor and CCC agree otherwise.

[[Page 279]]

    (2) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not 
apply:
    (i) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local 
governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall be charged in 
accordance with applicable statutes or, if none are applicable, at the 
rate of interest charged by the U.S. Treasury for funds borrowed by CCC 
on the day the debt became delinquent;
    (ii) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement or contract 
either prohibits the charging of such interest or specifies the interest 
or charges applicable to the debt involved;
    (iii) If the late payment interest is waived by CCC.
    (b) CCC will assess late payment interest on the full amount of 
delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term ``full amount 
of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued regular 
loan interest or accrued program interest, and any other charges which 
are otherwise due and owing to CCC on the delinquent debt at the time 
the late payment interest is assessed, except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
    (c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate 
of interest which CCC charges on delinquent debts. The late payment 
interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's 
current value of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the 
Prompt Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
    (d)(1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract or 
other agreement with specific provisions for late payment interest and 
payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of 
the debt from the first day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise 
provided by statute.
    (2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, 
contract or agreement containing specific provisions for late payment 
interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which notice of the debt is first mailed or 
hand-delivered to the debtor, except that, with respect to debts 
resulting from price support loans, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which a claim is established.
    (3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be 
fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except when a debtor has 
defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new 
agreement. CCC may then set a new rate of interest which reflects the 
late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is 
executed. All charges which accrued, but which were not collected under 
the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid 
under a new repayment agreement.
    (4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a 
daily basis.
    (e)(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (e)(2) of this 
section, an additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will 
be assessed on any portion of a debt which remains unpaid 90 days after 
the date described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, if no 
repayment schedule satisfactory to CCC has been agreed upon. Such rate 
will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began 
to accrue and apply on a daily basis. Such rate shall continue to accrue 
until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (2) With respect to debts resulting from price support loans, an 
additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will be assessed 
on a portion of a debt which remains unpaid 60 days after the date on 
which a claim was established. Such rate will be assessed retroactively 
from the date of claim establishment and apply on a daily basis. Such 
rate shall continue to accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (f) CCC shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs 
of processing delinquent debts against the debtor, to the extent such 
costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are 
not limited to, costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of 
employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing 
contractors for collection services,

[[Page 280]]

costs of selling collateral or property to satisfy the debt.
    (g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments 
will be applied first to administrative charges, second to additional 
interest assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and 
late payment interest, and third to outstanding principal.

<R05>
Sec. 1403.10  Waiver of late payment interest, additional interest and administrative charges.

    (a) Except for debts resulting from price support loans, CCC shall 
waive the collection of late payment interest and administrative charges 
on a debt or any portion of a debt which is paid within 30 days after 
the date on which late payment interest began to accrue.
    (b) CCC may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion 
of the additional interest on debts which are appealed in accordance 
with 7 CFR part 780, or other applicable appeal procedures, from either 
the date of the appeal or the date of delinquency, as determined by CCC, 
until the date a final administrative determination is issued. However, 
with respect to CCC programs administered by the Foreign Agricultural 
Service, CCC shall waive the assessment and collection of additional 
interest on debts which are appealed in accordance with 7 CFR part 780, 
or other applicable appeal procedures, from the date of delinquency 
until 30 days after the date of the letter informing the appellant of 
the final administrative determination. The waiver provisions of the 
paragraph shall not apply during any period of delay due to:
    (1) The appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled 
hearing;
    (2) The appellant's request for an additional time following the 
hearing to present additional information or a written closing 
statement; or
    (3) The appellant's failure to timely present information to the 
reviewing authority.
    (c) Assessment and collection of late payment interest, additional 
interest and administrative charges under this part may be waived by CCC 
in full, or in part, if it is determined that such action is in the best 
interest of CCC.

Sec. 1403.11  Administrative appeal.

    If the opportunity to appeal the determination has not previously 
been provided under part 24 or 780 of this title or any other appeal 
procedure, a debtor may obtain an administrative review under part 780 
of this title, or other applicable appeal procedures, of CCC's 
determination concerning the existence or amount of a debt, if a request 
is filed with the authority who made the determination within 15 days of 
the date of CCC's initial demand letter, unless a longer period is 
specified in the initial demand letter.

    When a debtor is employed by the Federal Government or is a member

offset cannot be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, CCC may 
contact the employing agency to arrange for payment of the debt by 
allotment or otherwise, in accordance with section 206 of Executive 
Order No. 11222, May 8, 1965, 30 FR 6469.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.14  Prior provision of rights with respect to debt.

    CCC will not provide an administrative appeal with respect to issues 
which were subject to administrative review at the debtor's request as 
provided under another statute or regulation before:
    (a) Effecting administrative offset;
    (b) Referring the debt to private collection or credit reporting 
agencies;

[[Page 281]]

procedures for collection of 1988 and 1989 advance deficiency 
overpayments (``overpayments'').
    (b) The following definition shall be applicable to this section:
    Financial hardship means that condition of a producer in which 
payment of the debt by lump sum would jeopardize the producer's ability 
to provide food, shelter, and medical care to his immediate family, or 
to continue the producer's farming operation, as determined by CCC.
    (c) This section applies to collection of overpayments from those 
producers who are suffering financial hardship, as determined by CCC, 
and who also meet the following conditions, as determined by CCC:
    (1) Who received an advance deficiency payment for the 1988 or 1989 
crop of a commodity under part 1413 of this chapter;
    (2) Who are required to provide a refund of at least $1,500 of such 
payment, as a result of the increase in market prices of the commodity;
    (3) Who reside in a county, or in a county that is contiguous to a 
county where CCC has determined that farming, ranching, or aquaculture 
operations have been substantially affected as evidenced by a reduction 
in normal production for the county of at least 30 percent during two of 
the three crop years 1988, 1989, and 1990 by:
    (i) A natural disaster designated by the Secretary of Agriculture;
    (ii) A major disaster or emergency designated by the President under 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
5121 et seq.);
    (4) Where the total quantity of the 1988 or 1989 crop of the 
commodity that the producers were able to harvest is less than the 
result of multiplying 65 percent of the farm payment yield established 
CCC for the crop by the sum of the acreage planted for the harvest and 
the acreage prevented from being planted (because of the disaster or 
emergency referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) for the crop; 
and
    (5) Who have applied to the County Farm Service Agency Office which 
issued the advance deficiency payment, no later than May 31, 1991, for a 
determination of eligibility for the repayment provisions of this 
section.
    (d) CCC shall assess interest on delinquent debts for 1988 or 1989 
overpayments as follows:
    (1) CCC shall establish a regional annual interest rate for each of 
12 geographic regions, corresponding to the extent practicable, as 
determined by CCC, with the 12 geographic districts of the Farm Credit 
System.
    (2) Each regional annual interest rate shall not exceed the average 
of the interest rates charged by Farm Credit System institutions within 
the region to high-risk borrowers on 1-year operating loans, as 
determined by CCC based upon information provided to CCC by the Farm 
Credit System.
    (3) Interest shall accrue at the established regional annual 
interest rate for the region in which the debt arose, beginning November 
28, 1990.
    (e) CCC shall not offset, in each of the crop years 1990, 1991, and 
1992, more than \1/3\ of the farm program payments otherwise due a 
producer, as a result of the producer's delinquency in repaying the 
overpayment.
    (f) CCC shall permit producers to repay the overpayment in three 
equal installments during each of the crop years 1990, 1991, and 1992, 
if the producers document to CCC that they have entered into agreements 
to obtain multiperil crop insurance policies for the 1991 and 1992 crop 
years.

program or contract covered by the assignment. Any indebtedness owed by 
the assignor to CCC, FSA, or any other agency of the United States shall 
be subject to offset.

[[Page 285]]

provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any indebtedness owed by the 
assignor to CCC or FSA shall be offset from any payment which is owed by

to the assignor and the assignee. If, after investigation and 
opportunity for the assignor and assignee to be heard, FSA or CCC finds 
that any material misrepresentation was in fact made, FSA or CCC shall 
notify the assignor and the assignee of such finding, and void such 
assignment, and insofar as concerns FSA, CCC or any other agency of the

herein shall be construed to authorize any suit against the United 
States, the CCC, the Secretary or any disbursing agent if payment is not

1410, 1412, 1421, 1427, 1435, 1443, 1446, or 1464, the producer must 
obtain at least the catastrophic level of insurance for each crop of 
economic significance in which the producer has an interest or provide a 
written waiver to the Secretary that waives any eligibility for 
emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop, if insurance 
is available in the county for the crop. In meeting this requirement, 
the producer may:
    (1) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance in all 
counties for each crop of economic significance in which the producer 
has an interest;
    (2) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance for 
some, but not all, crops of economic significance for which the producer 
has an interest, and sign a waiver; or
    (3) Sign a waiver that waives any eligibility for crop loss 
assistance in connection with the producer's crop.
    (b) Crop of economic significance. The term ``crop of economic 
significance'' means a crop that has contributed in the previous year, 
or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, 10 percent or 
more of the total expected value of all crops grown by the producer. 
However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the total expected 
liability under the catastrophic risk protection endorsement is equal to 
or less than the administrative fee required for the crop, such crop 
will not be considered a crop of economic significance.

with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are 
proposed to be closed to the public or with respect to the withholding

a portion of a Board's meeting requests that the Board close such 
portion to the public on the basis of exemptions (5), (6), or (7) of

its members, will vote whether or not to close such portion of the 
meeting. The vote of each Director participating in such vote will be

change and the vote of each Director upon such change at the earliest 
practicable time.

    (a) The regulations in this part will be administered under the 
general supervision and direction of the Executive Vice President, 
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and the Administrator, Farm Service 
Agency (FSA), through the Deputy Administrator. In the field, the 
regulations in this part will be administered by the State and county 
FSA committees (``State committees'' and ``county committees,'' 
respectively).
    (b) State executive directors, county executive directors, and State 
and county committees do not have the authority to modify or waive any 
of the provisions in this part unless specifically authorized by the 
Deputy Administrator.
    (c) The State committee may take any action authorized or required 
by this part to be taken by the county committee which has not been 
taken by such committee, such as:
    (1) Correct or require a county committee to correct any action 
taken by such county committee which is not in accordance with this 
part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action which 
is not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No delegation herein to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, the Administrator, FSA, or a 
designee, or the Deputy Administrator from determining any question 
arising under this part or from reversing or modifying any determination 
made by a State or county committee.
    (e) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine 
eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; 
however, the failure to

[[Page 293]]

provide data could result in program benefits being withheld or denied.
    (f) Notwithstanding other provisions of the preceding paragraphs of 
this section, the EI, suitability of land for permanent vegetative or 
water cover, factors for determining the likelihood of improved water 
quality and adequacy of the planned practice to achieve desired 
objectives shall be determined by the Natural Resource Conservation 
Service (NRCS) or any other non-USDA source approved by NRCS, in 
accordance with the Field Office Technical Guide of NRCS or other 
guidelines deemed appropriate by the NRCS, except that no such 
determination by NRCS shall compel CCC to execute a contract which CCC 
does not believe will serve the purposes of the program established by 
this part.
    (g) State committees, with NRCS, may develop a State evaluation 
process to rank acreage based on State-specific goals and objectives 
where such an evaluation process would further the goals of CRP. Such 
State committees may choose between developing a State ranking system or 
using the national ranking system. States' ranking processes shall be 
developed based on recommendations from State Technical Committees, 
follow national guidelines, and be approved by the Deputy Administrator.
    (h) CCC may consult with the Forest Service (FS), a State forestry 
agency, or other organization for such assistance as is determined by 
CCC to be necessary for developing and implementing conservation plans 
which include tree planting as the appropriate practice or as a 
component of a practice.
    (i) CCC may consult with the Cooperative State Research, Education, 
and Extension Service to coordinate a related information and education 
program as deemed appropriate to implement the Conservation Reserve 
Program (CRP).
    (j) CCC may consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or 
State wildlife agencies for such assistance as is determined necessary 
by CCC to implement the CRP.
    (k) The regulations governing the CRP as of February 11, 1997, shall 
continue to be applicable to contracts in effect as of that date. The 
regulations set forth in this part as of February 12, 1997, shall be

    (a) Under the CRP, CCC will enter into contracts with eligible 
participants to convert eligible land to a conserving use for a period 
of time of not less than 10 nor more than 15 years in return for 
financial and technical assistance.
    (b) A conservation plan for eligible acreage must be obtained by a 
participant which must be approved by the conservation district in which 
the lands are located unless the conservation district declines to 
review the plan in which case NRCS may take such further action as is 
needed to account for lack of such review.
    (c) The objectives of the CRP are to cost-effectively reduce water 
and wind erosion, protect the Nation's long-term capability to produce 
food and fiber, reduce sedimentation, improve water quality, create and 
enhance wildlife habitat, and other objectives including encouraging 
more permanent conservation practices and tree planting.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided, a participant may, in addition to 
any payment under this part, receive cost-share assistance, rental or 
easement payments, or tax benefits from a State, subdivision of such 
State, or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in CRP. 
However, a participant may not receive or retain CRP cost-share 
assistance if other Federal cost-share assistance is provided for such 
acreage under any other provision of law, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator. Further, under no circumstances may the cost-share 
payments received under this part, or otherwise, exceed the cost of the

the owner, must have operated such land for at least 12 months prior to 
the close of the applicable signup period and must provide satisfactory 
evidence that such operator will be in control of such eligible land for 
the full term of the CRP contract period;
    (2) If an owner of eligible land, must have owned such land for at 
least 12 months prior to the close of the applicable signup period, 
unless:
    (i) The new owner acquired such land by will or succession as a 
result of the death of the previous owner;
    (ii) The only ownership change in the 12 month period occurred due 
to foreclosure on the land and the owner of

[[Page 297]]

the land, immediately before the foreclosure, exercises a timely right 
of redemption from the mortgage holder in accordance with State law;
    (iii) As determined by the Deputy Administrator, the circumstances 
of the acquisition are such that present adequate assurance that the new 
owner of such eligible land did not acquire such land for the purpose of 
placing it in the CRP; or

Sec. 1410.6  Eligible land.

    (a) In order to be eligible to be placed in the CRP, land:
    (1) Must be cropland that:
    (i) Has been annually planted or considered planted to an 
agricultural commodity in 2 of the 5 most recent crop years, as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator, provided further that field 
margins which are incidental to the planting of crops may also be 
considered qualifying cropland to the extent determined appropriate by 
the Deputy Administrator; and
    (ii) Is physically and legally capable of being planted in a normal 
manner to an agricultural commodity, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.
    (2) Must be marginal pasture land, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, that:
    (i) Is enrolled or has recently been enrolled in the WBP provided:
    (A) The acreage is in the final year of the WBP agreement or, if not 
in the final year of the WBP agreement and only for enrollments in the 
CRP for FY 1997, is acreage for which the WBP agreement expired on 
December 31, 1996, where the land would be considered in compliance if 
such agreement was still in effect, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator;
    (B) The acreage is not classified as naturally occurring type 3 
through 7 wetlands, as determined by the Deputy Administrator regardless 
of whether the acreage is or is not protected by a Federal agency 
easement or mortgage restriction (types 3 through 7 wetlands that are 
normally artificially flooded shall not be precluded from eligibility), 
and;
    (C) Enrollment in CRP would enhance the environmental benefits of 
the site, as determined by Deputy Administrator; or
    (ii) Is determined to be suitable for use as a riparian buffer. A 
field or portion of a field of marginal pasture land may be considered 
to be suitable for use as a riparian buffer only if, as determined by 
NRCS, it:
    (A) Is located adjacent to permanent stream corridors excluding 
corridors that are considered gullies or sod waterways; and
    (B) Is capable, when permanent grass, forbs, shrubs or trees are 
grown, of substantially reducing sediment that otherwise would be 
delivered to the adjacent stream or waterbody; or
    (3) Must be acreage currently enrolled in the CRP provided the 
scheduled expiration date of the current CRP contract is to occur before 
the available effective date of a new CRP contract, as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator, provided the acreage is otherwise eligible

contour grass strip, grass waterway, field windbreak, shelterbelt, 
living snowfence, other uses as may be determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, vegetation on salinity producing areas, including any 
applicable recharge area, or any area determined eligible for CRP based 
on wetland or wellhead protection area criteria to be eligible to be 
placed in the CRP. A field or portion of a field may be considered to be 
suitable for use as a filter strip or riparian buffer only if it, as 
determined by NRCS:
    (i) Is located adjacent to a stream, other waterbody of a permanent 
nature (such as a lake, pond, or sinkhole), or

[[Page 298]]

wetland excluding such areas as gullies or sod waterways; and
    (ii) Is capable, when permanent grass, forbs, shrubs or trees are 
grown, of substantially reducing sediment that otherwise would be 
delivered to the adjacent stream or waterbody; or
    (2)(i) Be a field which has evidence of scour erosion caused by out-
of-bank flows of water, as determined by NRCS. In addition such land 
must:
    (A) Be expected to flood a minimum of once every 10 years; and
    (B) Have evidence of scour erosion as a result of such flooding.
    (ii) To the extent practicable, be the actual affected cropland 
areas of a field; however, the entire cropland area of an eligible field 
may be enrolled if:
    (A) The size of the field is 9 acres or less; or
    (B) More than one third of the cropland in the field is land which 
lies between the water source and the inland limit of the scour erosion.
    (iii) If the full field is not eligible for enrollment under this 
paragraph (b)(2), be that portion of the cropland between the waterbody 
and the inland limit of the scour erosion together with, as determined 
by the Deputy Administrator, additional areas which would otherwise be 
unmanageable and would be isolated by the eligible areas.
    (iv) Be planted to an appropriate tree species according to the 
FOTG, unless tree planting is determined to be inappropriate by NRCS, in 
consultation with Forest Service, in which case the eligible cropland 
shall be devoted to another acceptable permanent vegetative cover in 
accordance with the FOTG; or
    (3) Be contributing to the degradation of water quality or posing an 
on-site or off-site environmental threat to water quality if such land 
remains in production so long as water quality objectives, with respect 
to such land, cannot be obtained under other Federal programs, including 
but not limited to EQIP authorized under part 1466 of this chapter; or
    (4) Be devoted to certain covers, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, which are established and maintained according to the 
FOTG provided such acreage is not required to be maintained as such 
under any life-span obligations, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator; or
    (5) Be non-irrigated or irrigated cropland which produces or serves 
as the recharge area, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, for 
saline seeps, or acreage which is functionally related to such saline 
seeps, or where a rising water table contributes to increased levels of 
salinity at or near the ground surface; or
    (6) Be considered HEL according to conservation compliance 
provisions under part 12 of this chapter; or
    (7) For redefined fields, have an EI of greater than or equal to 8, 
calculated by using the weighted average of the EI's of soil map units 
within the field; or
    (8) Be within a public wellhead protection area or in an approved 
Hydrologic Unit Area; or
    (9) Be within a designated conservation priority area; or
    (10) Be designated as a cropped wetland and appropriate associated 
acreage, as determined by the Deputy Administrator; or
    (11) Be cropland which, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, 
is associated with noncropped wetlands and would provide significant 
environmental benefits; or
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, land 
shall be ineligible for enrollment if, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator, land is:
    (1) Federally owned land unless the applicant has a lease for the 
contract period;
    (2) Land on which the use of the land is restricted through deed or 
other restriction prior to enrollment in CRP prohibiting the production 
of agricultural commodities except for eligible land under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section; or
    (3) Land already enrolled in the CRP unless the scheduled expiration 
date of the current contract is to occur before the available effective 
date of a new CRP contract, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

Sec. 1410.8  Conservation priority areas.

    (a) CCC may designate National conservation priority areas according 
to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) State FSA committees, in consultation with NRCS and State 
Technical Committees, may submit a recommendation to the Deputy 
Administrator within guidelines established by the Deputy Administrator 
for designation of conservation priority areas. Such recommendations 
should contain clearly defined conservation and environmental objectives 
and analysis of how CRP can cost-effectively address such objectives. 
The purpose of the conservation priority area designation is to enhance 
the CRP by better addressing conservation and environmental issues in a 
planned and coordinated manner within a State. Generally, the total 
acreage of conservation priority areas, in aggregate, shall not total 
more than 10 percent of the cropland in a State unless there are 
identified and documented extraordinary environmental needs, as 
determined by Deputy Administrator.
    (c) A region shall be eligible for designation as a priority area 
only if the region has actual significant adverse water quality or 
wildlife habitat impacts related to activities of agricultural 
production or if the designation helps agricultural producers to comply 
with Federal and State environmental laws.
    (d) Conservation priority area designations shall expire after 5 
years unless redesignated, except they may be withdrawn:
    (1) Upon application by the appropriate State water quality agency; 
or
    (2) By the Deputy Administrator.
    (e) In those areas designated as conservation priority areas, under 
this section, special emphasis will be placed on identified 
environmental concerns. These concerns may include water quality, such 
as assisting agricultural producers to comply with nonpoint source 
pollution requirements, air quality, or wildlife habitat (especially for 
currently listed threatened and endangered species or to prevent other 
species from becoming threatened and endangered), as determined by the 
Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1410.9  Alley-cropping.

    (a) Alley-cropping on CRP land may be permitted by CCC if:
    (1) The land is planted to, or converted to, hardwood trees in 
accordance with Sec. 1410.10;
    (2) Agricultural commodities are planted in accordance with a prior, 
site-specific and NRCS approved conservation plan in close proximity to 
such hardwood trees; and
    (3) The owner and operator of such land agree to implement 
appropriate conservation measures on such land.
    (b) CCC may solicit bids for alley-cropping permission for CRP land. 
Annual rental payments for the term of any contract modified under this 
section shall be reduced by at least 50 percent of the original amount 
of the total rental payment in the original contract and, in the case of 
any contract modified to change from another cover crop, the total 
annual rental payments over the term of any such contract may not exceed 
the total annual rental payments specified in the original contract.
    (c) The actual reduction in rental payment will be determined by 
CCC, based upon criteria, such as percentage of the total acreage that 
will be available for cropping and projected returns to the producer 
from such cropping.
    (d) The area available for cropping will be chosen according to the 
FOTG and will be farmed in accordance with an approved conservation plan 
so as to minimize erosion and degradation of water quality during those 
years when

[[Page 300]]

the areas are devoted to an agricultural commodity.

    An owner or operator who has entered into a contract prior to 
November 28, 1990, may elect to convert areas of highly erodible 
cropland, subject to such contract, which is devoted to permanent 
vegetative cover, from such cover to hardwood trees (including alley 
cropping and riparian buffers limited to hardwood trees where permitted 
by CCC), windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors.
    (a) With respect to any contract modified under this section, the 
participant may elect to extend such contract in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1410.7(b).
    (b) With respect to any contract modified under this section in 
which such areas are converted to windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife 
corridors, the owner of such land must agree to maintain such plantings 
for a time period established by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) CCC shall, as it determines appropriate, pay up to 50 percent of 
the eligible cost of establishing new conservation measures authorized 
under this section, except that the total cost-share paid with respect 
to such contract, including cost-share assistance paid when the original 
cover was established, may not exceed the amount by which CCC would have 
paid had such land been originally devoted to such new conservation 
measures.
    (d) With respect to any contract modified under this section, the 
participant must participate in the Forest Stewardship Program (16 
U.S.C. 2103a).

    (a) An owner or operator who entered into a CRP contract on land 
that is suitable for restoration to wetlands or that was restored to 
wetlands while under such contract, may, if approved by CCC, subject to 
any restrictions as may be imposed by law, apply to transfer such 
eligible acres subject to such contract that are devoted to an approved 
cover from the CRP to the WRP. Transferred acreage shall be terminated 
from the CRP effective the day a WRP easement is filed. Participants 
will receive a prorated CRP annual payment for that part of the year the 
acreage was enrolled in the CRP according to Sec. 1410.42. Refunds of 
cost-share payments or any applicable incentive payments need not be 
required unless specified by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) An owner or operator who has enrolled acreage in the CRP may, as 
determined and approved by CCC, restore suitable acres to wetlands with 
cost-share assistance provided that Federal cost-share assistance has 
not been previously provided specifically for wetland restoration on the 
proposed restoration site. In addition to the cost-share limitation in 
Sec. 1410.41 of this part, an additional one time financial incentive 
may be provided to encourage restoration of the hydrology of the site.

may allow cost-share payments for maintenance costs to the extent 
required by Sec. 1410.40 and CCC may determine the period and amount of 
such cost-share payments.
    (b) The average cost of performing a practice may be determined by 
CCC based on recommendations from the State Technical Committee. Such 
cost may be the average cost in a State, a county, or a part of a State 
or county, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (c) A one-time financial incentive, may be offered to participants 
who restore the hydrology of eligible wetlands in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1410.11(b) or other lands as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator; such incentives will not be greater than 25 percent of 
the cost of restoring such wetlands or other lands, as determined by 
CCC.

payment limitations under this part.
    (d) In the case of a contract succession, annual rental payments 
shall be divided between the predecessor and the successor participants 
as agreed to among the participants and approved by CCC. If there is no 
agreement among the participants, annual rental

[[Page 306]]

payments shall be divided in such manner deemed appropriate by the 
Deputy Administrator and such distribution may be based on the actual 
days of ownership of the property.
    (e) CCC shall, when appropriate, prepare a schedule for each county 
that shows the maximum soil rental rate CCC may pay which may be 
supplemented to reflect special contract requirements. As determined by 
the Deputy Administrator, such schedule will be calculated based on the 
relative productivity of soils within the county using NRCS data and 
local FSA average cash rental estimates. The schedule will be posted in 
the local FSA office. As determined by the Deputy Administrator, the 
schedule shall indicate, when appropriate, that:
    (1) Contracts offered by producers who request rental payments 
greater than the schedule for their soil(s) will be rejected;
    (2) Offers of contracts that are expected to provide especially high 
environmental benefits, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, may

operator, upon the approval of CCC, may become a participant to a new 
CRP contract with CCC with respect to such transferred land.
    (2) With respect to the transferred land, if the new owner or 
operator becomes a successor to the existing CRP contract, the new owner 
or operator shall assume all obligations under the CRP contract of the 
previous participant.
    (3) If the new owner or operator becomes a successor to a CRP 
contract with CCC, then, except as otherwise determined appropriate by 
the Deputy Administrator:
    (i) Cost-share payments shall be made to the participant, past or 
present, who established the practice; and
    (ii) Annual rental payments to be paid during the fiscal year when 
the land was transferred shall be divided between the new participant 
and the previous participant in the manner specified in Sec. 1410.42.
    (b) If a participant transfers all or part of the right and interest 
in, or right to occupancy of, land subject to a

[[Page 307]]

CRP contract and the new owner or operator does not become a successor 
to such contract within 60 days of such transfer, such contract shall be 
terminated with respect to the affected portion of such land and the 
original participant:
    (1) Must forfeit all rights to any future payments with respect to 
such acreage;
    (2) Shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 1410.32(h); and
    (3) Refund all previous payments received under the contract by the 
participant or prior participants, plus interest, except as otherwise 
specified by the Deputy Administrator.

continue to receive payments provided for in such contract so long as:
    (1) The property is maintained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract;
    (2) Such operator continues to be the operator of the property; and
    (3) Ownership of the property remains with such federal agency.

    (2) If the CRP contract is terminated by CCC in accordance with this 
paragraph:
    (i) The participant shall forfeit all rights to further payments 
under such contract and refund all payments previously received together 
with interest; and
    (ii) Pay liquidated damages to CCC in such amount as specified in 
such contract.
    (b) If the Deputy Administrator determines such failure does not 
warrant termination of such contract, the Deputy Administrator may 
authorize relief as the Deputy Administrator deems appropriate.
    (c) CCC may reduce a demand for a refund under this section to the 
extent CCC determines that such relief would be appropriate and will not 
deter the accomplishment of the goals of the program.

evidence to indicate whether the person seeking participation as a 
tenant does or does not have an interest in the acreage offered for 
enrollment in the CRP.
    (b) CCC may remove an operator or tenant from a CRP contract when 
the operator or tenant:
    (1) Requests, in writing to be removed from the CRP contract;

appropriate by CCC.
    (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, 
fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of cost-share 
assistance or annual rental payments, or obtaining a payment that 
otherwise would not be payable.
    (c) A new owner or operator or tenant of land subject to this part 
who succeeds to the responsibilities under this part shall report in 
writing to CCC any interest of any kind in the land subject to this part 
that is retained by a previous participant. Such interest shall include 
a present, future, or conditional interest, reversionary interest, or 
any option, future or present, with respect to such land, and any 
interest of any lender in such land where the lender has, will, or can 
obtain, a right of occupancy to such land or an interest in the equity 
in such land other than an interest in the appreciation in the value of 
such land occurring after the loan was made. Failure to fully disclose

<R05>
Sec. 1410.61  Filing of false claims.

    If it is determined by CCC that any participant has knowingly 
supplied false information or has knowingly filed a false claim, such

filed and the contract may be terminated in which case a full refund of 
all prior payments may be demanded. False information or false claims 
include, but are not limited to, claims for payment for practices which 
do not meet the specifications of the applicable conservation plan. Any 
amounts paid under these circumstances shall be refunded, together with 
interest as determined by CCC, and any amounts otherwise due such 
participant shall be withheld. The remedies provided for in this section

the contract such additional terms as needed to enforce these 
regulations which shall be binding on the parties and may be enforced to 
the same degree as provisions of these regulations.
    (d) Absent a scheme or device to defeat the purpose of the program, 
when an owner loses control of CRP acreage due to foreclosure and the 
new owner chooses not to continue the contract in accordance with 
Sec. 1410.51, refunds shall not be required from any participant on the

forgiving such repayment is appropriate in order to provide fair and 
equitable treatment.
    (e) Crop insurance purchase requirements in part 1405 of this 
chapter apply to contracts executed in accordance with this part.
    (f) Land enrolled in CRP shall be classified as cropland for the

Sec. 1412.101  Applicability.

    The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (1996 
Act) provides producers on farms with 1996 wheat, corn, barley, grain 
sorghum, oats, upland cotton and rice crop acreage bases the opportunity 
to enter into Production Flexibility Contracts with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) for the years 1996 through 2002. Producers who 
participate in the program must fully comply with the terms of the 
production flexibility contracts and this part, and in return will 
receive production flexibility payments.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.102  Administration.

    (a) The program is administered under the general supervision of the 
Executive Vice-President, CCC, and shall be carried out by State and 
county Farm Service Agency (FSA) committees (herein called State and 
county committees).
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and their 
employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any of the 
provisions of the regulations of this part.
    (c) The State committee shall take any action required by the 
regulations of this part that the county committee has not taken. The 
State committee shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the 
regulations of this part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice President (Administrator, FSA), or a 
designee, from determining any question arising under the program or 
from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county 
committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines, except statutory deadlines, and 
other program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet 
such other

[[Page 311]]

requirements does not adversely affect operation of the program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute a form CCC-478, ``1996 
through 2002 Production Flexibility Contract'' only under the terms and 
conditions determined and announced by the Executive Vice President, 
CCC. Any contract that is not executed in accordance with such terms and 
conditions, including any purported execution prior to the date 
authorized by the Executive Vice President, CCC, is null and void.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.103  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section shall be applicable for 
all purposes of administering the Production Flexibility Program. The 
terms defined in parts 718 of this title and 1400 of this chapter shall 
also be applicable, except where those definitions conflict with the 
definitions set forth in this section.
    Annual payment amount is the amount to be paid under a contract in 
effect for each fiscal year with respect to a contract commodity and 
equals the product of:
    (1) 85 percent of the enrolled contract acreage multiplied by
    (2) The payment yield multiplied by
    (3) The payment rate except that the total of such payments shall 
not exceed $40,000 per person in accordance with part 1400 of this 
chapter.

effect on January 1, 1996, at part 1413 of this chapter. If a crop has a 
designated crop-rotation crop acreage base for 1995, the 1996 crop 
acreage base established for such crop is determined by averaging 
planted and considered planted acreages determined in accordance with 
part 1413 of this chapter as it was in effect on January 1, 1996, taking 
into consideration the number of years in the most recent rotation 
cycle. The sum of the crop acreage bases for a farm cannot exceed the 
cropland for the farm, less cropland enrolled in the Conservation 
Reserve Program in accordance with parts 704 and 1410 of this title, 
except to the extent that such excess is due to an established practice 
of double cropping on the farm in accordance with regulations in effect 
as of January 1, 1996, at part 1413 of this chapter.
    Grain sorghum means grain sorghum of a feed grain or dual purpose 
variety (including any cross that, at all stages of growth, has most of 
the characteristics of a feed grain or dual purpose variety). Sweet 
sorghum is not considered a grain sorghum.

canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, or, if designated by CCC, 
other oilseeds, planted for harvest as seed, or volunteer acreages of 
such crops from which the seed is harvested.
    Owner means an owner as defined in part 718 of this title and, only 
for purposes of enrolling a farm in the program authorized by this part 
or taking any subsequent action to maintain the eligibility of the farm, 
any agency of the Federal Government; however, such agency shall not be 
eligible to receive any payment made pursuant to such contract.
    Payment rate means the annual payment rate determined and announced 
by CCC.
    Payment yield means the payment yield established for the crop of a 
contract commodity for the farm in accordance with the regulations in 
effect on January 1, 1996, at part 1413 of this chapter. CCC shall 
adjust the payment yield to reflect the additional payments made in 
accordance with Sec. 1413.15 of such regulations.
    Rice means rice excluding sweet, glutinous, or candy rice such as 
Mochi Gomi.
    Upland cotton means planted and stub cotton that is produced from 
other

[[Page 312]]

than pure strain varieties of the Barbadense species, any hybrid 
thereof, or any other variety of cotton in which one or more of these 
varieties predominate. For program purposes, brown lint cotton is 
considered upland cotton.

                               Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1412.201  Production flexibility contract.

    (a) CCC shall offer to enter into a 7-year contract with an eligible 
producer on a farm having eligible acreage.
    (b) A transfer (or change) in the interest of an owner or producer 
subject to a contract in the contract acreage covered by the contract 
shall result in the termination of the contract with respect to the 
acreage, unless the transferee or owner of the acreage agrees to assume 
all obligations under the contract. The termination shall be effective 
on the date of the transfer or change.
    (c) All producers sharing in the contract payments on a farm whose 
payment shares have not been designated for a fiscal year must sign the 
contract designating payment shares and provide supporting documentation 
as specified in parts 12, 1400, and 1405 of this title no later than 
August 1 of the fiscal year to be eligible to earn a contract payment in 
that fiscal year. If all producers have not signed the contract by this 
deadline, no producers on the contract will be eligible for a payment 
for that farm for that fiscal year.

[61 FR 37575, July 18, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 55152, Oct. 23, 1997; 
63 FR 31103, June 8, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1412.202  Eligible producers.

    Producers eligible to enter into a contract are:
    (a) An owner of a farm who assumes all or a part of the risk of 
producing a crop;
    (b) A producer (other than an owner) on a farm with a share-rent 
lease for such farm, regardless of the length of the lease, if the owner 
enters into the same contract;
    (c) A producer (other than an owner) on an eligible farm who rents 
such farm under a lease expiring on or after September 30, 2002, in 
which case the owner is not required to enter into the contract;
    (d) A producer (other than an owner) on an eligible farm who cash 
rents such farm under a lease expiring before September 30, 2002. The 
owner of such farm may also enter into the same contract. If the 
producer elects to enroll less than 100 percent of the crop acreage 
bases in the contract, the consent of the owner is required;
    (e) An owner of an eligible farm who cash rents such farm and the 
lease term expires before September 30, 2002, if the tenant declines to 
enter into a contract. In the case of an owner covered by this 
paragraph, contract payments shall not begin under a contract until the 
lease held by the tenant ends; and
    (f) An owner or producer described in paragraphs (a) through (e) 
regardless of whether the owner or producer purchased catastrophic risk 
protection in accordance with part 1405 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.203  Notification of eligible contract acreage.

    The owner, and operator and all producers on a farm shall be 
notified in writing of the number of acres eligible for enrollment in a 
contract.

Sec. 1412.204  Reconstitutions.

    Farms shall be reconstituted in accordance with part 718 of this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.205  Reducing contract acreage.

    (a) A permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's contract 
acreage or eligible contract acreage shall be allowed at the written 
request of the

[[Page 313]]

owner to the county committee on Form CCC-505.
    (b) If the producers convert contract acreage to a non-agricultural 
commercial or industrial use, the contract acreage shall be reduced 
accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.206  Planting flexibility.

    (a) For the 1996 through 2002 crop years, any crop may be planted on 
contract acreage on a farm, except as limited elsewhere in this section. 
For fiscal year 1998, for each acre a producer plants wild rice on 
contract acreage, 1 acre will not be used in determining the contract 
payment. Any crop may be planted on cropland in excess of the contract 
acreage.
    (b) Contract acreage may be hayed or grazed at any time.
    (c) Planting fruits and vegetables (except lentils, mung beans, and 
dry peas), is prohibited on contract acreage, except:
    (1) A producer may double crop fruits or vegetables with a contract 
commodity in any region described in paragraph (d) of this section, in 
which case contract payments will not be reduced. Double cropping for 
purposes of this section means planting for harvest fruits or vegetables 
in cycle on the same acres with a contract commodity planted for grain 
or lint in a 12 month period under weather conditions normal for the 
region and being able to repeat the same cycle in the following 12 month 
period;
    (2) On a farm that the county committee determines has a history of 
planting fruits or vegetables, in which case contract payments shall be 
reduced in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;
    (3) By a producer that the county committee determines a history of 
fruit or vegetables as the simple average of the sum of a specific fruit 
or vegetable planted for harvest by the producer during the years 1991 
through 1995, excluding any year in which a fruit or vegetable was not 
planted, in which case contract payments shall be reduced in accordance 
with paragraph (e); or
    (4) On a farm with a 1995 rotation designation crop acreage base 
established in accordance with part 1413 of this title as in effect on 
January 1, 1996, and the producers on the farm planted fruits or 
vegetables as a part of the rotation, in which case there will be no 
reduction in contract payments if the acreage of fruits and vegetables 
continue to be planted in the same rotation cycle with contract 
commodities, the acreage of fruits and vegetables is not increased, and 
an annual acreage report is filed for the farm.
    (d) For purposes of this part, the following counties have been 
determined to be regions having a history of doublecropping contract 
commodities with fruits or vegetables. State committees have established 
the following counties as regions within their respective States:

    (e) For each acre a producer plants to fruits or vegetables on 
contract acreage under paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section, 1 acre 
will not be used in determining the contract payment. The calculation 
for this reduction is based on the contract crop with the lowest payment 
amount per acre. Reductions will be prorated among all producers based 
on each producer's share of the total payment for the farm. Such 
producers may adjust the reduction in payments as they agree upon.

Sec. 1412.207  Succession-in-interest to a production flexibility contract.

    (a) A person may succeed to the contract if there has been a change 
in the operation of a farm, such as:
    (1) A sale of land;
    (2) A change of operator or producer, including a change in a 
partnership that increases or decreases the number of partners; or
    (3) A foreclosure, bankruptcy, or involuntary loss of the farm after 
enrollment in a production flexibility contract.
    (b) A succession in interest to the contract is not permitted if CCC 
determines that the change results in a violation of the landlord-tenant 
provisions set forth at Sec. 1412.304, or otherwise defeats the purpose 
of the program.
    (c) If a producer who is entitled to a contract payment dies, 
becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive the contract 
payment, the CCC will make the payment in accordance with part 707 of 
this title.
    (d) A producer or owner must inform the county committee of changes 
in interest not later than:
    (1) August 1 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if 
producers on the contract acreage remain the same, but payment shares 
change; or
    (2) August 1 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs, if a new 
producer is being added to the contract.
    (e) In any case in which payment has previously been made to a 
predecessor, such payment shall not be paid to the successor. If the 
predecessor refunds an advance contract payment, such producer shall not 
be assessed interest in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 1412.301  Limitation of production flexibility contract payments.

    The sum total of annual contract payment amounts shall not exceed 
the amounts specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

[[Page 317]]


<R05>
Sec. 1412.302  Contract payment provisions.

    (a) A producer may request 50 percent of each fiscal year's contract 
payment as an advance payment.
    (b) At the option of the producer, for fiscal year 1997 and each 
subsequent fiscal year, 50 percent of the annual contract payment shall 
be paid on December 15 or January 15, as requested by the producer. To 
receive the advance payment the producers on the farm must be in 
compliance with all requirements of the contract at the time of the 
advance payment. For fiscal year 1998 and each subsequent fiscal year, 
all producers sharing in the contract payment on the farm must no later 
than 15 days prior to the final date to issue the advance payment, sign 
the contract designating payment shares and provide supporting 
documentation as specified in parts 12, 1400, and 1405 of this title, if 
applicable; and request the advance payment. If all producers on the 
farm have not signed the contract designating payment shares according 
to this paragraph, then no producers will be eligible for a payment for 
that farm for that fiscal year.
    (c) A final contract payment shall be made not later than September 
30 of each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2002.
    (d) If a producer declines to accept, or is determined to be 
ineligible for all or any part of the producer's share of the production 
flexibility payment computed for the farm in accordance with the 
provisions of this section:
    (1) The payment or portions thereof shall not become available for 
any other producer; and
    (2) The producer shall refund to CCC any amounts representing 
payments that exceed the payments determined by CCC to have been earned 
under the program authorized by this part. Part 1403 of this chapter 
shall be applicable to all unearned payments.

<R05>
Sec. 1412.303  Sharing of contract payments.

    (a) Each eligible producer on a farm shall be given the opportunity 
to enroll in a contract and receive contract payments determined fair 
and equitable as agreed to by the producers on the farm and approved by 
the county committee.
    (1) Producers must provide a copy of their written lease to the 
county committee, and, in the absence of a written lease, must provide 
to the county committee a complete written description of the terms and 
conditions of any oral agreement or lease.
    (2) A lease will be considered a cash lease if the lease provides 
for only a guaranteed sum certain cash payment, or a fixed quantity of 
the crop (for example, cash, pounds, or bushels per acre).
    (3) If a lease contains provisions that require the payment of rent 
on the basis of the amount of crop produced or the proceeds derived from 
the crop, or the interest such producer would have had if the crop had 
been produced, or combination thereof, such agreement shall be 
considered to be a share lease.
    (4) Beginning on October 1, 1998, for years in which payment shares 
had not been designated prior to October 23, 1997, a producer's lease, 
including a lease which provides for the greater of a guaranteed amount 
or share of the crop or crop proceeds, shall be considered a share lease 
if the lease provides for both:
    (i) A guaranteed amount such as a fixed dollar amount or quantity; 
and
    (ii) A share of the crop proceeds.
    (5) If the lease is a cash lease, the landlord is not eligible for a 
contract payment.
    (6) A lease that the county committee determined to be a cash lease 
under Sec. 1412.303 as contained in the 7 CFR, parts 1200 to 1499, 
edition revised as of January 1, 1997, will be considered a cash lease 
for the years in which payment shares were designated if, prior to 
October 23, 1997:
    (i) The designation of shares was executed; and
    (ii) The county committee was provided a copy of the lease 
applicable for the designated years.
    (b) When contract acreage is leased on a share basis, neither the 
landlord nor the tenant shall receive 100 percent of the contract 
payment for the farm.

[[Page 318]]

    (1) A landowner may receive up to 100 percent of the contract 
payment if no lease exists with respect to the contract acreage. The 
leasing of grazing or haying privileges is not considered cash leasing.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) The county committee shall approve a contract for enrollment and 
approve the division of payment when all of the following apply:
    (1) The landowners, tenants and sharecroppers sign the contract and 
agree to the payment shares shown on the contract;
    (2) The county committee determines that the interests of tenants 
and sharecroppers are being protected; and
    (3) That the division of payments is not done in a manner to 
circumvent the provisions of part 1400 of this chapter.

[61 FR 37575, July 18, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 55152, Oct. 23, 1997;

<R05>
Sec. 1412.304  Provisions relating to tenants and sharecropper.

    (a) Contract payments shall not be made by CCC if:
    (1) The landlord or operator has adopted a scheme or device for the 
purpose of depriving any tenant or sharecropper of the payments to which 
such person would otherwise be entitled under the program. If any of 
such conditions occur or are discovered after payments have been made, 
all or any such part of the payments as the State committee may 
determine shall be refunded to CCC; or
    (2) The landlord terminated a lease in violation of state law as 
determined by a state court.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions set forth at Sec. 1412.302(c), if 
the landowners, tenants and sharecroppers on a farm fail to reach an 
agreement regarding the division of contract payments for a fiscal year, 
the county committee shall make the payment at a later date if all 
persons eligible to receive a share of the contract payment have 
executed a contract not later than August 1 of the applicable fiscal 
year and subsequently agree to the division of contract payment.

        Subpart D--Contract Violations and Diminution in Payments


<R05>
Sec. 1412.401  Contract violations.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if a 
producer subject to a contract violates a requirement of the contract 
specified in Secs. 1412.206(c), 1412.402, 1412.403, and 1412.405, the 
Deputy Administrator shall terminate the contract with respect to the 
producer on each farm in which the producer has an interest. Upon such 
termination, the producer shall forfeit all rights to receive future 
contract payments on each farm in which the producer has an interest and 
shall refund all contract payments received by the producer during the 
period of the violation, plus interest with respect to the contract 
payments as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.
    (b) If the county committee determines that a violation is not 
serious enough to warrant termination of the contract under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the county committee may require the producer 
subject to the contract either, or both of the following:
    (1) Refund to CCC that part of the contract payments received by the 
producer during the period of the violation, plus interest determined in 
accordance with part 1403 of this chapter; and
    (2) If there is a violation of Sec. 1412.206, accept a reduction in 
the amount of current and future contract payments that is equal to the 
sum proportionate to the severity of:
    (i) Market value of the fruit and vegetables planted on each 
contract acreage; and
    (ii) The contract payment for each such acre.
    (c) Producers who do not plant a crop on contract acreage must 
protect any such land from weeds and erosion, including providing 
sufficient cover if determined necessary by the county committee. The 
first violation of this provision by a producer will result in a 
reduction in the producer's payment for

[[Page 319]]

the farm by an amount equal to 3 times the cost of maintenance of the 
acreage, but not to exceed 50 percent of the payment for the farm for 
that fiscal year. The second violation of this provision will result in 
a reduction in the payment for the farm by an amount equal to 3 times 
the cost of maintenance of the acreage, not to exceed the payment for 
the farm for that fiscal year.

plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.
    (b) A producer who is determined to have knowingly:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination shall 
refund to CCC all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with 
part 1403 of this chapter received by such producer with respect to all 
contracts. The producer's interest in all contracts shall be terminated.


<R05>
Sec. 1412.406  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof to any person shall be made without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found at part 1403 of this chapter 
shall be applicable to contract payments.
    (b) Any producer entitled to any payment may assign any payments in 
accordance with regulations governing assignment of payment found at

not report all of the fruits and vegetables planted on contract acreage, 
the contract shall be terminated with respect to such farm unless the 
provisions of Sec. 1412.401(b)(1) and (2) are applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 1412.501  Timing for enrollment and termination of production flexibility contracts.

    (a) At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall allow 
an eligible producer on a farm with acreage enrolled in a Conservation 
Reserve Program contract in accordance with parts 704 or 1410 of this 
title that terminates after August 1, 1996, to enter into or modify an 
existing production flexibility contract if such land otherwise would 
have been eligible for enrollment under this part as of August 1, 1996.

[[Page 320]]

    (b) A production flexibility contract shall begin with the 1996 crop 
of a contract commodity or in the case of acreage that was enrolled in 
the Conservation Reserve Program, the date the production flexibility 
contract was entered into or modified to include the acreage previously 
subject to the Conservation Reserve Program contract.
    (c) All contracts shall terminate on September 30, 2002, unless 
terminated at an earlier date by mutual consent of all parties.
    (d) A contract for farms whose Conservation Reserve Program contract 
terminates after August 1, 1996, shall be signed by a producer no later 
than November 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year the 
Conservation Reserve Program contract is terminated.
    (e) A Conservation Reserve Program contract that is terminated:
    (1) In fiscal year 1996, if the effective date of the Conservation 
Reserve Program contract termination is earlier than August 1, 1996, and 
the land that was subject to the Conservation Reserve Program contract 
is enrolled in a production flexibility contract, the owner or producer 
is eligible to receive both the 1996 production flexibility contract 
payment and a prorated Conservation Reserve Program payment.
    (2) In fiscal years 1997 through 2002, if a conservation reserve 
contract is terminated, and the land that was subject to the 
conservation reserve contract is enrolled in a production flexibility 
contract, the owner or producer may elect to receive either the 
production flexibility contract payments or a prorated Conservation 
Reserve Program payment, but not both.

Sec. 1421.4  Eligible producers.

    (a) An eligible producer of a crop of a commodity shall be a person 
(i.e., an individual, partnership, association, corporation, estate, 
trust, State or political subdivision or agency thereof, or other legal 
entity) that:
    (1) Produces such a crop as a landowner, landlord, tenant, or 
sharecropper, or in the case of rice, furnishes land, labor, water, or 
equipment for a share of the rice crop;
    (2) Meets the requirements of this part; and
    (3) Meets the requirements of parts 12, 718, 1405, 1412, and 1446 of 
this title.
    (b) A receiver or trustee of an insolvent or bankrupt debtor's 
estate, an executor or an administrator of a deceased person's estate, a 
guardian of an estate of a ward or an incompetent person, and trustees 
of a trust shall be considered to represent the insolvent or bankrupt 
debtor, the deceased person, the ward or incompetent, and the 
beneficiaries of a trust, respectively, and the production of the 
receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee shall be 
considered to be the production of the person or estate represented by 
the receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee. Loan or 
loan deficiency payment documents executed by any such person will be 
accepted by CCC only if they are legally valid and such person has the 
authority to sign the applicable documents.
    (c) A minor who is otherwise an eligible producer shall be eligible 
to receive loans or loan deficiency payments only if the minor meets one 
of the following requirements:
    (1) The right of majority has been conferred on the minor by court 
proceedings or by statute;
    (2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property and 
the applicable loan or loan deficiency payment documents are signed by 
the guardian;
    (3) Any note signed by the minor is cosigned by a person determined 
by the county committee to be financially responsible; or
    (4) A bond is furnished under which a surety guarantees to protect 
CCC from any loss incurred for which the minor would be liable had the 
minor been an adult.
    (d)(1) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint loan with 
respect to commodities that are stored in the same farm storage 
facility. Two or more producers may obtain individual loans with respect 
to their share of the commodity that is stored commingled in a farm 
storage facility with commodities owned by other producers if such other 
producers execute Form

[[Page 323]]

CCC-665 that provides that such producers shall obtain the permission of 
a representative of the county committee before removal of any quantity 
of the commodity from the storage facility. All producers who store a 
commodity in a farm storage facility in which commodities that have been 
pledged as collateral for a loan shall be liable for any damage incurred 
by CCC with respect to the deterioration or unauthorized removal or 
disposition of such commodities in accordance with Sec. 1421.17.
    (2) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint loan with 
respect to commodities that are stored in an approved warehouse if the 
warehouse receipt that is pledged as collateral for the loan is issued 
jointly to such producers.
    (3) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
with CCC, each such producer shall be jointly and severally liable for 
the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and the 
regulations set forth in this part. Each such producer shall also remain 
liable for repayment of the entire loan amount until the loan is fully 
repaid without regard to such producer's claimed share in the commodity 
pledged as collateral for the loan. In addition, such producer may not 
amend the note and security agreement with respect to the producer's 
claimed share in such commodities, or loan proceeds, after execution of 
the note and security agreement by CCC.
    (e)(1) The county committee may deny a producer a loan on farm-
stored commodities if the producer has:
    (i) Been convicted of a criminal act;
    (ii) Has made a misrepresentation, with respect to acquiring a farm-
stored loan or in the maintenance of the commodity pledged as security 
for a farm-stored loan; or
    (iii) Failed to protect adequately the interests of CCC in the 
commodity pledged as security for a farm-stored loan.
    (2) In such cases, the producer shall be ineligible for subsequent 
farm-stored loans unless the county committee determines that the 
producer will adequately protect CCC's interest in the commodity that 
would be pledged as collateral for such a loan. A producer who is denied 
a farm-stored loan will be eligible to pledge a commodity as collateral 
for a warehouse-stored loan.
    (f) Warehouse-stored loans may be made to a warehouse operator who, 
acting on behalf and with the authorization of a producer, tenders to 
CCC warehouse receipts issued by such warehouse operator for a commodity 
produced by such warehouse operator only in those States where the 
issuance and pledge of such warehouse receipts is valid under State law.
    (g) An approved cooperative marketing association (CMA) may obtain a 
loan on the eligible production of such commodity or loan deficiency 
payment with respect to such commodity on behalf of the members of the 
CMA who are eligible to receive loans and loan deficiency payments with 
respect to a crop of a commodity. For purposes of this subpart and in 
applicable loan and loan deficiency payment forms, the term producer 
includes an approved CMA.
    (h) With respect to peanuts tendered to CCC for loan, a producer 
must also meet the provisions of part 1446 of this title. Before 
obtaining a farm-stored loan with respect to additional peanuts, a 
producer must register as a handler with the State FSA office of the 
State in which the producer's farm is located.
    (i)(1) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint loan 
deficiency payment with respect to commodities that are stored in the 
same farm storage facility. Two or more producers may obtain individual 
loan deficiency payments with respect to their share of the commodity 
that is stored commingled in a farm storage facility with commodities 
owned by other producers. All producers who store a commodity in a farm 
storage facility in which commodities for which a loan deficiency 
payment has been requested shall be liable for any damage incurred by 
CCC with respect to incorrect certification of such commodities in 
accordance with Sec. 1421.16.
    (2) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint loan deficiency 
payment with respect to commodities that are stored in an approved or 
unapproved warehouse if the acceptable

[[Page 324]]

documentation representing an eligible commodity for which a loan 
deficiency payment is requested is completed jointly for such producers.
    (3) Each producer who is a party to a joint loan deficiency payment 
will be jointly and severally responsible and liable for the breach of 
the obligations set forth in the loan deficiency payment documents and 
in the applicable regulations in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.5  General eligibility requirements.

    (a) A producer must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request 
loans and loan deficiency payments at the county office that, in 
accordance with part 718 of this title, is responsible for administering 
programs for the farm on which the commodity was produced. An approved 
CMA must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request loans and loan 
deficiency payments at the location designated by CCC. An eligible 
producer who produces a crop of barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, rice, 
or wheat on a farm covered by a production flexibility contract shall be 
eligible for a loan on any production of that commodity. In the case of 
oilseeds, any production produced by an eligible producer shall be 
eligible for a loan. To receive loans or loan deficiency payments for a 
crop of a commodity, a producer must execute a note and security 
agreement or loan deficiency payment application on or before:
    (1) January 31 of the year following the year in which the crop of 
peanuts is normally harvested for additional peanuts pledged as 
collateral for a farm-stored loan;
    (2) March 31 of the year following the year in which the following 
crops are normally harvested: quota peanuts pledged as collateral for a 
farm-stored loan, barley, canola, flaxseed, oats, rapeseed, and wheat;
    (3) April 30 of the year following the year in which the crop of 
peanuts is harvested for quota peanuts tendered for purchase; or
    (4) May 31 of the year following the year in which the following 
crops are normally harvested: corn, grain sorghum, mustard seed, rice, 
safflower, soybeans, and sunflower seed.
    (b)(1) To be eligible to receive loans or loan deficiency payments, 
commodities must be tendered to CCC by an eligible producer and must be 
eligible and in existence when approved by CCC. To be eligible to 
receive loans, commodities must also be stored in approved storage at 
the time of disbursement of loan proceeds. The commodity must not have 
been sold, nor any sales option on such commodity granted, to a buyer 
under a contract that provides that the buyer may direct the producer to 
pledge the commodity to CCC as collateral for a loan or to obtain a loan 
deficiency payment. Such commodities must also be merchantable for food, 
feed, or other uses determined by CCC and must not contain mercurial 
compounds, toxin producing molds, or other substances poisonous to 
humans or animals. Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, 
such commodities that contain vomitoxin levels of 5 or less parts per 
million or contain levels of more than 5 parts per million, may be 
eligible for a nonrecourse or recourse loan, respectively. Corn 
containing aflatoxin levels not exceeding 20 parts per billion may be 
eligible for a nonrecourse loan.
    (2) The determination of class, grade, grading factors, milling 
yields, and other quality factors, including the determination of type, 
quality and quantity for peanuts:
    (i) With respect to barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, grain sorghum, 
oats, rice, soybeans, sunflower seed for extraction of oil, and wheat, 
shall be based upon the Official United States Standards for Grain and 
the Official United States Standards for Rice as applied to rough rice 
whether or not such determinations are made on the basis of an official 
inspection. The costs of an official grade determination may be paid by 
CCC. The grade and grading requirements that are used in administering 
loans and loan deficiency payments for the commodities in this paragraph 
are available in State and county offices.
    (ii) With respect to a crop of mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower 
seed, and sunflower seed used for a purpose other than to extract oil, 
shall be based on quality requirements established and announced by CCC, 
whether or not such

[[Page 325]]

determinations are made on the basis of an official inspection. The 
costs of an official quality determination may be paid by CCC. The 
quality requirements that are used in administering loans and loan 
deficiency payments for the oilseeds in this paragraph are available in 
State and county offices.
    (iii) With respect to peanuts, shall be determined at the time of 
delivery to CCC by a Federal-State Inspector authorized or licensed by 
the Secretary.
    (3) Corn pledged as collateral for a farm-stored loan may be ear or 
shelled corn, but may not be ground ear corn. If the collateral is ear 
corn, the producer must:
    (i) Before delivery to CCC, shell such corn without cost to CCC; and
    (ii) Before removal of the commodity for shelling, have the approval 
of CCC in accordance with Sec. 1421.20. Corn pledged as collateral for a 
warehouse-stored loan must be shelled corn.
    (4) When a quantity of a commodity is determined by weight, the 
following shall apply:
    (i) A bushel of barley shall be 48 pounds of barley free of dockage;
    (ii) A bushel of corn shall be 56 pounds of shelled corn;
    (iii) A bushel of oats shall be 32 pounds of oats;
    (iv) Quantities of peanuts shall be determined in tons and 
hundredths of a ton;
    (v) Quantities of farm-stored rice shall be in whole units of 100 
pounds of rice;
    (vi) A bushel of soybeans shall be 60 pounds of soybeans with no 
more than 1 percent foreign material;
    (vii) A bushel of grain sorghum shall be 56 pounds of grain sorghum 
free of dockage;
    (viii) A bushel of wheat shall be 60 pounds of wheat free of 
dockage;
    (ix) Quantities of farm-stored canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, 
rapeseed, safflower seed, and sunflower seed shall be determined in 
whole units of 100 pounds of the respective commodity;
    (x) A bushel of canola shall be 50 pounds of canola free of dockage;
    (xi) A bushel of flaxseed shall be 56 pounds of flaxseed free of 
dockage;
    (xii) A bushel of mustard seed shall be 54 pounds of mustard seed 
free of dockage;
    (xii) A bushel of rapeseed shall be 50 pounds of rapeseed free of 
dockage;
    (xiv) A bushel of safflower seed shall be 40 pounds of safflower 
seed free of dockage; and
    (xv) A bushel of sunflower seed shall be 28 pounds of sunflower seed 
free of foreign material.
    (5) With respect to farm-stored loans and loan deficiency payments, 
all determinations of weight and quality, except as otherwise agreed to 
by CCC, shall be determined at the time of delivery of the commodity to 
CCC or at the time the loan deficiency payment application is filed.
    (c)(1) To be eligible to receive loans or loan deficiency payments, 
a producer must have the beneficial interest in the commodity that is 
tendered to CCC for a loan or loan deficiency payment. The producer must 
always have had the beneficial interest in the commodity unless, before 
the commodity was harvested, the producer and a former producer whom the 
producer tendering the commodity to CCC has succeeded had such an 
interest in the commodity. Commodities obtained by gift or purchase 
shall not be eligible to be tendered to CCC for loans or loan deficiency 
payments. Heirs who succeed to the beneficial interest of a deceased 
producer or who assume the decedent's obligations under an existing loan 
or loan deficiency payment shall be eligible to receive loans and loan 
deficiency payments whether succession to the commodity occurs before or 
after harvest so long as the heir otherwise complies with the provisions 
of this part.
    (2) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the 
beneficial interest in the commodity if the producer retains control, 
title, and risk of loss in the commodity, including the right to make 
all decisions regarding the tender of such commodity to CCC for loans or 
loan deficiency payments, and the producer:
    (i) Executes an option to purchase, whether or not a payment is made 
by the potential buyer for such option to purchase, with respect to such 
commodity if all other eligibility requirements are met and the option 
to purchase contains the following provision:

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title, risk of loss,

[[Page 326]]

and beneficial interest in the commodity, as specified in 7 CFR part 
1421, shall remain with the producer until the buyer exercises this 
option to purchase the commodity. This option to purchase shall expire, 
notwithstanding any action or inaction by either the producer or the 
buyer, at the earlier of: (1) The maturity of any CCC loan which is 
secured by such commodity; (2) the date the CCC claims title to such 
commodity; or (3) such other date as provided in this option

or

    (ii) Enters into a contract to sell the commodity if the producer 
retains title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the commodity 
and the purchaser does not pay to the producer any advance payment 
amount or any incentive payment amount to enter into such contract 
except as provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (3) If loans and loan deficiency payments are made available to 
producers through an approved CMA in accordance with part 1425 of this 
chapter, the beneficial interest in the commodity must always have been 
in the producer-member who delivered the commodity to the CMA or its 
member CMA's, except as otherwise provided in this section. Commodities 
delivered to such a CMA shall not be eligible to receive loans or loan 
deficiency payments if the producer-member who delivered the commodity 
does not retain the right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of 
the commodity as provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (d)(1) A producer may, before the final date for obtaining a loan 
for a commodity, re-offer as collateral for such a loan any commodity 
that had been previously pledged as collateral for a loan, except with 
respect to:
    (i) Commodities that have been acquired in accordance with part 1401 
of this chapter;
    (ii) Commodities that have been redeemed at a rate that is less than 
the loan rate as determined in accordance with Sec. 1421.25; and
    (iii) Commodities for which a payment has been made in accordance 
with Sec. 1421.29.
    (2) The commodity re-offered as security for the subsequent loan 
shall have the same maturity date as the original loan.
    (e) Producers who redeem loan collateral at the lower loan repayment 
rate in accordance with Sec. 1421.25 or, in lieu of receiving a loan 
receive a loan deficiency payment in accordance with Sec. 1421.29, shall 
provide CCC with:
    (1) Evidence of production of the collateral such as sales receipts 
or other written documentation acceptable to CCC; or
    (2) The storage location of the collateral that has not been 
otherwise disposed of and allow CCC access to such collateral; and
    (3) Permission to inspect, examine, and make copies of the records 
and other written data as deemed necessary to verify the eligibility of 
the producer and commodity.
    (f) Producers who redeem loan collateral or receive a loan 
deficiency payment for a commodity in accordance with paragraph (e) of 
this section must provide evidence of production acceptable to CCC 
before the final loan availability date of the crop year for such 
commodity following the crop year for which the loan or loan deficiency 
payment was made. Production evidence includes but is not limited to:
    (1) Evidence of sales;
    (2) Load summary or assembly sheets;
    (3) Warehouse receipts issued by a warehouse that is approved 
according to Sec. 1421.8(b) or by a warehouse that is not approved; and
    (4) Quantities determined by measurement at CCC's discretion.
    (g) If the producer fails to provide acceptable evidence of 
production as required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, such 
producer shall be required to repay the market gain or loan deficiency 
payment and charges, plus interest.
    (h) The loan documents shall not be presented for disbursement 
unless the commodity subject to the note and security agreement is an 
eligible commodity, in existence, and is in approved storage. If the 
commodity was not either an eligible commodity, in existence, or in 
approved storage at the time of disbursement, the total amount disbursed 
under the loan and charges plus interest shall be refunded promptly by 
the producer.
    (i) CCC shall limit the total loan quantity for a loan disbursement 
or

[[Page 327]]

loan deficiency quantity for a loan deficiency payment based on a 
subsequent increase in the quantity of eligible commodity by the final 
loan availability date to 100 percent of the outstanding quantity of 
such loan or loan deficiency payment application. A producer may obtain 
a separate loan or loan deficiency payment before the final loan 
availability date for the commodity for quantities in excess of 100 
percent of such quantity if such quantities are an otherwise eligible 
commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.6  Maturity dates.

    (a)(1) All loans shall mature on demand by CCC and with respect to:
    (i) All commodities, except peanuts and loan collateral transferred 
in accordance with Sec. 1421.17(c) and (d), no later than the last day 
of the 9th calendar month following the month in which the note and 
security agreement is filed in accordance with Sec. 1421.5(a) and 
approved; and
    (ii) Peanuts, April 30 of the year following the year the commodity 
is normally harvested.
    (2) CCC may at any time accelerate the loan maturity date by 
providing the producer notice of such acceleration at least 30 days in 
advance of the accelerated maturity date.
    (3) The request for a loan shall not be approved until all producers 
having an interest in the collateral sign the note and security 
agreement and CCC approves such note and security agreement.
    (b) If a producer fails to settle the loan in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section within 30 days from the maturity date of 
such loan, or other reasonable time period as established by CCC, a 
claim for the loan amount and charges plus interest shall be 
established. CCC shall:
    (1) Inform the producer before the maturity date of the loan of the 
date by which the loan must be settled or a claim will be established in 
accordance with part 1403 of this title; and
    (2) If the producer delivers the loan collateral in accordance with 
Sec. 1421.22 after a claim is established:
    (i) Determine the value of the settlement for such collateral in 
accordance with Sec. 1421.22;
    (ii) Waive interest on the loan amount that accrued before the 
establishment of the claim with respect to the settlement value of the 
quantity delivered from the date such loan proceeds were disbursed 
through the loan maturity date. Interest that accrues after the 
establishment of the claim shall not be waived; and
    (iii) Reduce the outstanding claim amount arising from the loan by 
the amount of the settlement value of the quantity delivered plus the 
amount of interest that was waived.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.7  Adjustment of basic loan rates.

    (a) Basic loan rates for a commodity may be established on a State, 
regional, or county basis and may be adjusted by CCC to reflect quality

this section.
    (b) The basic loan rates for the wheat, corn, barley, oats, grain 
sorghum, rice, peanuts, soybean, canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, 
rapeseed, safflower, and sunflower seed crops will be determined by CCC 
and made available at State and county offices.
    (c)(1) With respect to all commodities except peanuts and rice, 
warehouse-stored loans shall be disbursed at levels based on the basic 
county loan rate for the county where the commodity is stored, adjusted 
for the schedule of premiums and discounts established for the commodity 
on the basis of quality factors set forth on warehouse receipts or 
supplemental certificates and for other quality factors, as determined 
and announced by CCC.
    (2) With respect to rice, warehouse-stored loans shall be disbursed 
at levels based on the milling yields times the whole and broken kernel 
loan rates, adjusted for the schedule of discounts on the basis of 
quality factors set forth on warehouse receipts or supplemental 
certificates and for other quality factors, as determined and announced 
by CCC.
    (3) With respect to commodities moved from one warehouse to another 
in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed by CCC on Form 
CCC-699, Reconcentration Agreement and Trust Receipt, the loan rate will 
be

[[Page 328]]

adjusted to reflect the new storage location.

Sec. 1421.8  Approved storage.

    (a) Approved farm storage shall consist of a storage structure 
located on or off the farm (excluding public warehouses) that is 
determined by CCC to be under the control of the producer and to afford 
safe storage of the commodity pledged as collateral for a loan. As may 
be determined and announced by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
approved farm storage may also include on-ground storage, temporary 
storage structures, or other storage arrangements.
    (b) Approved warehouse storage shall consist of:
    (1) A public warehouse for which a CCC storage agreement for the 
commodity is in effect and that is approved by CCC for price support 
purposes. Such a warehouse is referred to in this subpart as an approved 
warehouse. The names of approved warehouses may be obtained from the 
Kansas City Commodity Office, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 
64141-6205, or from State and county offices.
    (2) A warehouse operated by an approved CMA as defined in part 1425 
of this chapter.
    (c) The approved storage requirements provided in this section may 
be waived by CCC if the producer requests a loan deficiency payment 
pursuant to the loan deficiency payment provisions contained in 
Sec. 1421.29.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.9  Warehouse receipts.

    (a) Warehouse receipts tendered to CCC with respect to a loan or 
loan deficiency payment must meet the provisions of this section and all 
other provisions of this part, and CCC program documents.
    (b) Warehouse receipts must be issued in the name of the eligible 
producer or CCC. If issued in the name of the eligible producer, the 
receipts must be properly endorsed in blank in order to vest title in 
the holder. Receipts must be issued by an approved warehouse and must 
represent a commodity that is deemed to be stored commingled. The 
receipts must be negotiable and must represent a commodity that is the 
same quantity and quality as the eligible commodity actually in storage 
in the warehouse of the original deposit. However, warehouse receipts 
may be issued by another warehouse if the eligible commodity was 
reconcentrated in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1421.20(c).
    (c) If the receipt is issued for a commodity that is owned by the 
warehouse operator either solely, jointly, or in common with others, the 
fact of such ownership shall be stated on the receipt. In States where 
the pledge of warehouse receipts issued by a warehouse operator on the 
warehouse operator's commodity is invalid, the warehouse operator may 
offer the commodity to CCC for loan if such warehouse is licensed and 
operating under the U.S. Warehouse Act.
    (d) Each warehouse receipt or accompanying supplemental certificate 
representing a commodity stored in an approved warehouse that has a 
storage agreement with CCC shall indicate that the commodity is insured 
in accordance with such agreement. The cost of such insurance shall not 
be for the account of CCC.
    (e) A separate warehouse receipt must be submitted for each grade 
and class of any commodity tendered to CCC and, with respect to rice, 
such receipt must also state the milling yield of the rice.
    (f)(1) Each warehouse receipt, or a supplemental certificate (in 
duplicate) that properly identifies the warehouse receipt, must be 
issued in accordance with the Uniform Grain and Rice Storage Agreement 
or the U.S. Warehouse Act, as applicable, and must indicate:
    (i) The name and location of the storing warehouse;
    (ii) The warehouse code assigned by CCC;
    (iii) The warehouse receipt number;
    (iv) The date the receipt was issued;
    (v) The type of commodity;
    (vi) The date the commodity was deposited or received;
    (vii) The date to which storage has been paid or the storage start 
date;
    (viii) Whether the commodity was received by rail, truck or barge;
    (ix) The amount per bushel, pound, or hundredweight of prepaid in or 
out charges;

[[Page 329]]

    (x) The signature of the warehouse operator or the authorized agent; 
and
    (xi) For warehouses operating under a merged warehouse code 
agreement (KC-385), the location and county to which the producer 
delivered the commodity.
    (2) In addition to the information specified in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, additional commodity specific requirements shall be 
determined by CCC and are available at State and county offices and the 
Kansas City Commodity Office.
    (g) If a warehouse receipt indicates that the commodity tendered for 
loan grades ``infested'' or ``contains excess moisture'', or both, the 
receipt must be accompanied by a supplemental certificate as provided in 
Sec. 1421.18 in order for the commodity to be eligible for a loan. The 
grade, grading factors, and quantity to be delivered must be shown on 
the certificate as follows:
    (1) When the warehouse receipt shows ``infested'' and the commodity 
has been conditioned to correct the infested condition, the supplemental 
certificate must show the same grade without the ``infested'' 
designation and the same grading factors and quantity as shown on the 
warehouse receipt.
    (2)(i) When the warehouse receipt shows that the commodity contained 
excess moisture and the commodity has been dried or blended, the 
supplemental certificate must show the grade, grading factors, and 
quantity after drying or blending of the commodity. Such entries shall 
reflect a drying or blending shrinkage as provided in paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (ii) When a supplemental certificate is issued in accordance with 
paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2)(i) of this section, the grade, grading 
factors and the quantity shown on such certificate shall supersede the 
entries for such items on the warehouse receipt.
    (iii) If the commodity has been dried or blended to reduce the 
moisture content, the quantity specified on the warehouse receipt or the 
supplemental certificate shall represent the quantity after drying or 
blending.
    (iv) For commodities dried or blended in accordance with paragraph 
(g)(2)(iii) of this section, such quantity shall reflect a minimum 
shrinkage in the receiving weight excluding dockage:
    (A) For the following commodities, 1.3 times the percentage 
difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and 
the following percentages for the specified commodity:
    (1) Barley: 14.5 percent;
    (2) Corn: 15.5 percent;
    (3) Grain sorghum: 14.0 percent;

    (5) Rice: 14.0 percent;
    (6) Soybeans; 14.0 percent; and
    (7) Wheat: 13.5 percent.
    (B) For the following commodities, 1.1 times the percentage 
difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and 
the following percentages for the specified commodity:
    (1) Canola: 10.0 percent;
    (2) Flaxseed: 9.0 percent;
    (3) Mustard Seed: 10.0 percent;
    (4) Rapeseed: 10.0 percent;
    (5) Safflower Seed: 10.0 percent; and
    (6) Sunflower Seed: 10.0 percent.
    (h)(1) If, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, a 
supplemental certificate is issued in connection with a warehouse 
receipt, such certificate must state that no lien for processing will be 
asserted by the warehouse operator against CCC or any subsequent holder 
of such receipt.
    (2) Warehouse receipts and the commodities represented by such 
receipts that are stored in an approved warehouse that is operating in 
accordance with a Uniform Grain and Rice Storage Agreement (UGRSA) may 
be subject to a lien for warehouse charges only to the extent provided 
in Sec. 1421.10. In no event shall a warehouse operator be entitled to 
satisfy such a lien by sale of the commodities when CCC is the holder of 
such receipt.
    (i) Warehouse receipts representing commodities that have been 
shipped by rail or by barge, must be accompanied by supplemental 
certificates completed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.10  Warehouse charges.

    (a) CCC-approved handling and storage rates that may be deducted 
from loan proceeds are available in State and county offices. Such 
deductions shall be based upon the entries on the

[[Page 330]]

warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate, but in no case shall be 
higher than the CCC approved rate. No storage deduction shall be made if 
written evidence acceptable to CCC is submitted indicating that:
    (1) Storage charges through the maturity date have been prepaid; or
    (2) The producer has arranged with the warehouse operator for the 
payment of storage charges through the maturity date and the warehouse 
operator enters an endorsement in substantially the following form on 
the warehouse receipt:

    Storage arrangements have been made by the depositor of the grain 
covered by this receipt through (date through which storage has been 
provided). No lien will be asserted by the warehouse operator against 
CCC or any subsequent holder of the warehouse receipt for the storage 
charges that accrued before the specified date.

    (b) The beginning date to be used for computing storage deductions 
on the commodity stored in an approved warehouse shall be the later of 
the following:
    (1) The date the commodity was received or deposited in the 
warehouse;
    (2) The date the storage charges start; or
    (3) The day following the date through which storage charges have 
been paid.
    (c) For commodities delivered to CCC in settlement for a loan, CCC 
shall pay to the producer the warehouse charges for receiving the 
commodity, or in-charges. If the warehouse receipt delivered to CCC in 
settlement for a loan shows that such charges have been paid, CCC shall 
issue such payment to the producer. If the receipt shows that such 
charges have not been paid, the producer will assign such payment to the 
warehouse and CCC shall issue such payment to the warehouse for the 
producer's account.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.11  Liens.

    (a) The county office shall file or record, as required by State 
law, all security agreements that are issued with respect to commodities 
pledged as collateral for loans. The cost of filing and recording shall 
be paid for by CCC.
    (b) If there are any liens or encumbrances on the commodity, waivers 
that fully protect the interest of CCC must be obtained even though the 
liens or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No 
additional liens or encumbrances shall be placed on the commodity after 
the loan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.12  Fees, charges, and interest.

    (a) A producer shall pay a nonrefundable loan service fee to CCC at 
a rate determined by CCC. The amount of such fees are available in State 
and county offices and are shown on the note and security agreement.
    (b) Interest that accrues with respect to a loan shall be determined 
in accordance with part 1405 of this chapter. All or a portion of such 
interest may be waived with respect to a quantity of commodity that has 
been redeemed in accordance with Sec. 1421.25 at a rate that is less 
than the principal amount of the loan plus charges and interest.
    (c) For each crop of soybeans, the producer, as defined in the 
Soybean Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 
Chapter 6301), shall remit to CCC an assessment that shall be determined 
at the time CCC acquires the commodity, and shall be at a rate equal to 
one-half of 1 percent of the amount determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1421.19.
    (d) Additional fees representing amounts voted on by producers for 
marketing or promotional fees may be deducted from loan proceeds by CCC 
as requested and agreed to by the governing body of such marketing or 
promotional fee and CCC. Deduction of such fees from amounts due 
producers and the payment of such fees to such governing body shall be 
made by CCC in a manner and at such time as determined by CCC.

Secs. 1421.13-1421.14  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1421.15  Loss or damage to the commodity.

    The producer is responsible for any loss in quantity or quality of 
the commodity pledged as collateral for a farm-stored loan. CCC shall 
not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the loan collateral for 
farm-stored loans.

[[Page 331]]


<R05>
Sec. 1421.16  Personal liability of the producers.

    (a) When a producer obtains a commodity loan or requests a loan 
deficiency payment, the producer agrees:
    (1) When signing Form CCC-666, Farm Stored Loan Quantity 
Certification, when applicable, Form CCC-677, Farm Storage Note and 
Security Agreement, and Form CCC-678, Warehouse Storage Note and 
Security Agreement, that the producer will not:
    (i) Provide an incorrect certification of the quantity or make any 
fraudulent representation for the loan; or
    (ii) Remove or dispose of a quantity of commodity that is collateral 
for a CCC farm-stored loan without prior written approval from CCC in 
accordance with Sec. 1421.20;
    (2) When signing Form CCC-666 LDP, Loan Deficiency Payment 
Application and Certification, or CCC-709, Direct Loan Deficiency 
Payment Agreement, as applicable, that the producer will not provide an 
incorrect certification of the quantity or make any fraudulent 
representation for loan deficiency payment purposes; and
    (3) That violation of the terms and conditions of the Form CCC-677, 
Form CCC-678, Form CCC-666 LDP, or Form CCC-709, as applicable, will 
cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the 
producer for a quantity of a commodity that is not actually in existence 
or for a quantity on which the producer is not eligible.
    (b) The violations referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are 
defined as follows:
    (1) Incorrect certification is the certifying of a quantity of a 
commodity for the purpose of obtaining a commodity loan or a loan 
deficiency payment in excess of the quantity eligible for such loan or 
loan deficiency payment or the making of any fraudulent representation 
with respect to obtaining loans or loan deficiency payments;
    (2) Unauthorized removal is the movement of any farm-stored loan 
quantity from the storage structure in which the commodity was stored or 
structures that were designated when the loan was approved to any other 
storage structure whether or not such structure is located on the 
producer's farm without prior written authorization from the county 
committee in accordance with Sec. 1421.20, if the movement of loan 
collateral prevents CCC from obtaining the first lien on such 
collateral; and
    (3) Unauthorized disposition is the conversion of any loan quantity 
pledged as collateral for a farm-stored loan without prior written 
authorization from the county committee in accordance with Sec. 1421.20.
    (c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for the violations in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Accordingly, if the 
county committee determines that the producer has violated the terms and 
conditions of Form CCC-677, Form CCC-678, Form CCC-666 LDP, or Form CCC-
709, as applicable, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity 
of the commodity that is involved in the violation. If CCC determines 
the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the first offense; or
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for 
cases other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the loan 
deficiency payment rate.
    (d) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan 
quantity incorrectly certified or the loan quantity removed or disposed 
of for loan deficiency payment, the loan deficiency payment rate 
applicable to the loan deficiency quantity incorrectly certified, and 
charges, plus interest applicable to the amount repaid; and

[[Page 332]]

    (2) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 days from the 
date of notification, call the applicable loan involved in the 
violation, or for loan deficiency payments, require repayment of the 
entire loan deficiency payment and charges plus interest.
    (e) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, the county committee shall call the loan 
involved in the violation, or for loan deficiency payments, require 
repayment of the entire loan deficiency payment and charges plus 
interest.
    (f) The county committee:
    (1) May waive the administrative actions taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) if the county committee determines that:
    (i) The violation occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or 
unintentionally; or
    (ii) The producer acted to prevent spoilage of the commodity.
    (2) Shall not consider the following acts as inadvertent, 
accidental, or unintentional:
    (i) Movement of loan collateral off the farm;
    (ii) Movement of loan collateral from one storage structure to 
another on the farm, except as provided for in Sec. 1421.17(b)(1); and
    (iii) Feeding the loan collateral.
    (3) Shall furnish a copy of its determination to the State 
committee, and the Administrator. If the determination of the county 
committee is not disapproved by either the State committee or the 
Administrator, FSA, or a designee, within 60 calendar days from the date 
the determination is received, such determination shall be considered to 
have been approved.
    (g) If, for any violation in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, the county committee determines that CCC's interest is not or 
will not be protected, the county committee shall call any or all of the 
producer's farm-stored loans, and deny future farm-stored loans and loan 
deficiency payments without production evidence for 24 months after the 
date the violation is discovered. Depending on the severity of the 
violation, the county committee may deny future farm-stored loans and 
loan deficiency payments without production evidence for an additional 
12 month period.
    (h) If the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation in accordance with paragraph (b), the county 
committee shall notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section.
    (i) If the loan is called in accordance with this section, the 
producer may not repay the loan at the lower of the loan repayment rate 
in accordance with Sec. 1421.25 and may not utilize the provisions of 
part 1401 of this chapter with respect to such loan.
    (j) Producers who have been refused a farm-stored loan under 
provisions of this section may apply for a warehouse-stored loan.
    (k)(1) If a producer:
    (i) Makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or loan 
deficiency payment, maintaining, or settling a loan; or
    (ii) Disposes or moves the loan collateral without the approval of 
CCC, such loan shall be payable upon demand by CCC. The producer shall 
be liable for:
    (A) The amount of the loan or loan deficiency payment;
    (B) Any additional amounts paid by CCC with respect to the loan or 
loan deficiency payment;
    (C) All other costs that CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation, the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (D) Interest on such amounts; and
    (E) Liquidated damages assessed under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) With regard to amounts due for a loan, the payment of such 
amounts may not be satisfied by:
    (i) The forfeiture of loan collateral to CCC of commodities with a 
settlement value that is less than the total of such amounts; or
    (ii) By repayment of such loan at the lower loan repayment rate as 
prescribed in Sec. 1421.25 and may not utilize

[[Page 333]]

the provisions of part 1401 of this chapter with respect to such loans.
    (3) Notwithstanding any provisions of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent representation or 
if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without 
prior written approval from CCC in accordance with Sec. 1421.20, the 
value of the settlement for such collateral delivered to or removed by 
CCC shall be determined by CCC in accordance with Sec. 1421.22.
    (l) A producer shall be personally liable for any damages resulting 
from a commodity delivered to or removed by CCC containing mercurial 
compounds, toxin producing molds, or other substances poisonous to 
humans or animals.
    (m) If the amount disbursed under a loan or in settlement thereof, 
or loan deficiency payment exceeds the amount authorized by this part, 
the producer shall be liable for repayment of such excess and charges, 
plus interest.
    (n) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan is less than the amount required in accordance with this part, the 
producer shall be personally liable for repayment of the amount of such 
deficiency and charges, plus interest.
    (o) In the case of joint loans or loan deficiency payments, the 
personal liability for the amounts specified in this section shall be 
joint and several on the part of each producer signing the note or loan 
deficiency payment application.
    (p) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (c) may be waived as determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.17  Farm-stored commodities.

    (a) The quantity of a commodity that shall be used to determine the 
amount of a farm-stored loan shall not exceed a percentage (the loan 
percentage), as established by the State committee that shall not exceed 
a percentage established by CCC, of the certified or measured quantity 
of the eligible commodity stored in approved farm storage and covered by 
the note and security agreement. The quantity of a commodity pledged as 
security for a farm-storage loan shall be measured or certified in 
accordance with paragraph (e). Farm-stored loans may be made on less 
than the maximum quantity eligible for loan at the producer's request. 
If the loan quantity is reduced by the State committee, the county 
committee, or by request of the producer, such reduced quantity shall be 
the mortgaged quantity on the note and security agreement for the 
commodity in a bin, crib, or lot on which the loan is made.
    (1) With respect to additional peanuts, loans shall be made on 100 
percent of the estimated quantity pledged as collateral for a farm-
stored loan.
    (2) With respect to all other commodities, the State committee may 
establish a loan percentage that does not exceed a percentage 
established by CCC or may apply quality discounts to the loan rate, each 
year for each commodity on a Statewide basis or for specified areas 
within the State. Before approving a county committee request to 
establish a different loan percentage, or to apply quality discounts, 
the State committee shall consider conditions in the State or areas 
within a State to determine if the loan percentage should be reduced 
below the maximum loan percentage or the quality discounts should be 
applied to the basic county loan rate to provide CCC with adequate 
protection. Loans disbursed based upon loan percentages previously 
lowered and loan rates adjusted for quality shall not be altered if 
conditions within the State or areas within the State change to 
substantiate removing such reductions; percentages established or loan 
rates adjusted for quality in accordance with this section shall apply 
only to new loans and not to outstanding loans. The factors to be 
considered by the State committee in determining loan percentages or the 
necessity to apply quality discounts shall include but are not limited 
to:
    (i) General crop conditions;
    (ii) Factors affecting quality peculiar to an area within the State; 
and
    (iii) Climatic conditions affecting storability.
    (3) The loan percentages established by the State committee may be 
reduced by the county committee when authorized on an individual farm, 
area, or producer basis when determined to

[[Page 334]]

be necessary in order to provide CCC with adequate protection. The 
factors to be considered by the county committee in reducing the loan 
percentages shall include but not be limited to:
    (i) The condition or suitability of the storage structure;
    (ii) The condition of the commodity;
    (iii) The hazardous location of the storage structure, such as a 
location that exposes the structure to danger of flood, fire, and theft 
by a person not entrusted with possession of the commodity;
    (iv) Any disagreement with respect to the quantity of the commodity 
to be pledged as collateral for a loan; and
    (v) Such other factors that relate to the preservation or safety of 
the loan collateral.
    (b) If an eligible quantity of a commodity except peanuts, has been 
commingled with an ineligible quantity of the commodity, the commingled 
commodity is not eligible to be pledged as collateral for a loan unless:
    (1) The producer, when requesting a loan shall designate all 
structures that may be used for storage of the loan collateral. In such 
cases, the producer is not required to obtain prior written approval 
from the county committee before moving loan collateral from one 
designated structure to another designated structure. In all other 
instances, if the producer intends to move loan collateral from a 
designated structure to another undesignated structure, the producer 
must request prior approval from the county committee. Such approval 
shall be evidenced on Form CCC-687-1 and the eligible or ineligible 
commodity must be measured by a representative of the county office, at 
the producer's expense, before commingling; or
    (2) The producer has made a certification with respect to the 
acreage planted to the commodity that is to be commingled for all farms 
in which the producer has an interest. When certifying to the acreage on 
all farms in which interest is held, the producer must provide 
acceptable evidence of the production and purchase of the commodity from 
which the county committee may determine whether the eligible production 
claimed by the producer is reasonable in relation to the production 
practices on such farm or similar farms in the same county; or have 
either the eligible or ineligible commodity measured by a representative 
of the county office at the producer's expense, before commingling. 
Peanuts pledged as collateral for a loan must be stored separately from 
peanuts produced on any other farm and handled in such a manner that 
only the actual peanuts produced on the farm and on no other farm will 
be delivered to CCC.
    (c) Upon request by the producer before transfer, the county 
committee may approve the transfer of a quantity of a commodity that is 
pledged as collateral for a farm-stored loan to a warehouse-stored loan 
at any time during the loan period.
    (1) Liquidation of the farm-stored loan or part thereof shall be 
made through the pledge of warehouse receipts for the commodity placed 
under warehouse-stored loan and the immediate payment by the producer of 
the amount by which the warehouse-stored loan is less than the farm-
stored loan or part thereof and charges plus interest. The loan quantity 
for the warehouse-stored loan cannot exceed 110 percent of the loan 
quantity transferred from the farm-stored loan.
    (2) Any amounts due the producer shall be disbursed by the county 
office. The maturity date of the warehouse-stored loan shall be the 
maturity date applicable to the farm-stored loan that was transferred.
    (d) Upon request by the producer before the transfer, the county 
committee may approve the transfer of a warehouse-stored loan or part 
thereof to a farm-stored loan at any time during the loan period. 
Quantities pledged as collateral for a farm-stored loan shall be based 
on a measurement by a representative of the county office before 
approving the farm-stored loan. The producer must immediately repay the 
amount by which the farm-stored loan is less than the warehouse-stored 
loan and charges plus interest on the shortage. The maturity date of the 
farm-stored loan shall be the maturity date applicable to the warehouse-
stored loan that was transferred.

[[Page 335]]

    (e) The quantity of a commodity pledged as security for a farm-
stored loan or for which a loan deficiency payment is requested may be 
determined on the basis of the quantity of the commodity that an 
eligible producer certifies in writing on Form CCC-666 for a loan and 
Form CCC-666 LDP or CCC-709, as applicable, for a loan deficiency 
payment, is eligible to be pledged as collateral and is otherwise 
available for loan or loan deficiency payment purposes.
    (f) If the county committee determines, by measurement or otherwise, 
that the actual quantity serving as collateral for a loan is less than 
the loan quantity, the county committee shall take the actions specified 
in Sec. 1421.16.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.18  Warehouse-stored loans.

    (a) The quantity of a commodity that may be pledged as collateral 
for a loan shall be the quantity of any eligible commodity delivered to 
CCC for storage at an approved warehouse. Such quantity shall be the net 
weight specified on the warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate.
    (b) To be eligible to be pledged as collateral for a loan, the 
commodity must not be Sample Grade and must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 1421.5 and the commodity eligibility requirements, as determined by 
CCC. These requirements are available at State and county offices.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.19  Liquidation of loans.

    (a) If a producer does not pay to CCC the total amount due in 
accordance with a loan, CCC shall have the right to acquire title to the 
loan collateral and to sell or otherwise take possession of such 
collateral without any further action by the producer. With respect to 
farm-stored loans, the producer may, as CCC determines, deliver the 
collateral for such loan in accordance with instructions issued by CCC. 
CCC will not accept delivery of any quantity of a commodity in excess of 
110 percent of the outstanding farm-stored loan quantity. If a quantity 
in excess of 110 percent of the outstanding farm-stored loan quantity is 
shown on the warehouse receipt or other documents, the producer shall 
provide replacement warehouse receipts and delivery documents. If the 
warehouse receipt and such other documents applicable to the settlement 
are not replaced showing only the quantity eligible for delivery, CCC 
shall provide for such corrected documents and apply charges for such 
service, if any, to the producer's account as charges for settlement on 
the loan.
    (b) If the producer desires to deliver eligible commodities to CCC 
in satisfaction of the loan, the producer must notify CCC of such 
intention before the loan maturity date by giving written notice to the 
county office that disbursed the proceeds for such loan. If the producer 
fails to deliver such commodities to CCC by the date specified on Form 
CCC-691, Commodity Delivery Notice, and the producer subsequently 
redeems the commodity pledged as collateral for the loan before delivery 
is completed, interest shall continue to be assessed on such amount in 
accordance with part 1405 of this chapter.
    (c) If, either before or after maturity, the commodity is going out 
of condition or is in danger of going out of condition, the producer 
shall so notify the county office and confirm such notice in writing. If 
the county committee determines that the commodity is going out of 
condition or is in danger of going out of condition and the commodity 
cannot be satisfactorily conditioned by the producer and delivery cannot 
be accepted within a reasonable length of time, the county committee 
shall arrange for an inspection and grade and quality determination. 
When delivery is completed, settlement shall be made on the basis of 
such grade and quality determination or on the basis of the grade and 
quality determination made at the time of delivery, whichever is higher, 
for the quantity actually delivered.
    (d) If the producer loses control of the storage structure, or if 
there is insect infestation that cannot be controlled, danger of flood, 
or damage to the storage structure making it unsafe to continue storage 
of the commodity on the farm, the commodity may be delivered before the 
maturity date of the loan upon prior approval of the county committee in 
accordance with paragraph (a). Settlement will be made

[[Page 336]]

with the producer as provided in Sec. 1421.22.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.20  Release of the commodity pledged as collateral for a loan.

    (a) A producer, when requesting a loan shall designate specific 
storage structures on Form CCC-677, in accordance with 
Sec. 1421.17(b)(1). The producer is not required to request prior 
approval before moving loan collateral between such designated 
structures. Movement of loan collateral to any other structures not 
designated on CCC-677, or the disposal of such loan collateral without 
prior written approval of the county committee, shall subject the 
producer to the administrative actions specified in Sec. 1421.16. A 
producer may at any time obtain the release, in accordance with this 
section, of all or any part of the commodity remaining as loan 
collateral by paying to CCC, with respect to the quantity of the 
commodity released:
    (1) The principal amount of the loan that is outstanding and charges 
plus interest; or
    (2) If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount of 
the loan and charges plus interest under the terms and conditions 
specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the commodity pledged 
as collateral for such loan in accordance with Sec. 1421.25. The 
producer may request and CCC may approve removal of a quantity of the 
commodity from storage, without the payment to CCC of the loan amount, 
if the principal amount outstanding on such loan before such removal 
does not exceed the maximum loan value of the quantity of the commodity 
remaining in storage after such removal. When the proceeds of the sale 
of the commodity are needed to repay all or a part of a farm-stored 
loan, the producer must request and obtain prior written approval of the 
county office on a form prescribed by CCC in order to remove a specified 
quantity of the commodity from storage. Any such approval shall be 
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form, 
copies of which may be obtained by producers at the county office. Any 
such approval shall not constitute a release of CCC's security interest 
in the commodity or release the producer from liability for any amounts 
due and owing to CCC with respect to the loan indebtedness if full 
payment of such amounts is not received by the county office. If a 
producer fails to repay a loan within the time period prescribed by CCC 
for a farm-storage loan and commodity pledged as loan collateral has 
been delivered to a buyer in accordance with Form CCC-681-1, 
Authorization for Delivery of Loan Collateral for Sale, such producer 
may not repay the loan at the rate that is less than the loan rate 
determined in accordance with Sec. 1421.25(a)(1)(ii) or (b)(2).
    (b) CCC may allow a producer to establish a loan repayment rate 
determined in accordance with Sec. 1421.25 (a)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) on Form 
CCC-681-1, Authorization for Delivery of Loan Collateral for Sale, 
provided the producer complies with all terms and conditions set forth 
on Form CCC-681-1. If a producer fails to repay a loan within the time 
period prescribed by CCC in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
Form CCC-681-1 and the commodity pledged as collateral for such loan has 
been delivered to a buyer in accordance with Form CCC-681-1, such 
producer may not repay the loan at the rate that is less than the loan 
rate determined in accordance with Sec. 1421.25 (a)(1)(ii) or (b)(2).
    (c)(1) The producer may arrange with the county office for the 
release of all or part of the commodity that is pledged as collateral 
for a warehouse-stored loan at or before the maturity of such loan by, 
with respect to the quantity of the commodity to be released, paying to 
CCC:
    (i) The principal amount of the loan and charges plus interest; or
    (ii) If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount 
of the loan and charges plus interest under the terms and conditions 
specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the commodity pledged 
as collateral for such loan in accordance with Sec. 1421.25. Each 
partial release of the loan collateral must cover all of the commodity 
represented by one warehouse receipt. Warehouse receipts redeemed by 
repayment of the loan shall be released only to the producer. However, 
such receipts may be released to

[[Page 337]]

persons designated in a written authorization that is filed with the 
county office by the producer within 15 days before the date of 
repayment.
    (2) Upon the filing of Form CCC-699, Reconcentration Agreement and 
Trust Receipt, by the producer and warehouse operator, CCC may, during 
the loan period, approve the reconcentration in another CCC-approved 
warehouse of all or part of a commodity that is pledged as collateral 
for a warehouse-stored loan. Any such approval shall be subject to the 
terms and conditions set forth in Form CCC-699, Reconcentration 
Agreement and Trust Receipt.
    (3) A producer may, before the new warehouse receipt is delivered to 
CCC, pay to CCC:
    (i) The principal amount of the loan and charges plus interest and 
applicable charges; or
    (ii) If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount 
of the loan and charges plus interest under the terms and conditions 
specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the commodity pledged 
as collateral for such loan in accordance with Sec. 1421.25.
    (d) The note and security agreement shall not be released until the 
loan has been satisfied in full.
    (e) If the commodity is moved on a non-workday from storage without 
obtaining prior approval to move such commodity, such removal shall 
constitute unauthorized removal or disposition, as applicable, of such 
commodity unless the producer notifies the county office the next 
workday that such commodity has been moved and such movement is approved 
by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.21  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1421.22  Settlement.

    (a) The value of the settlement of loans shall be made by CCC on the 
following basis:
    (1) With respect to nonrecourse loans, the schedule of premiums and 
discounts for the commodity:
    (i) If the value of the collateral at settlement is less than the 
amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency 
and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or
    (ii) If the value of the collateral at settlement is greater than 
the amount due, such excess shall be retained by CCC and CCC shall have 
no obligation to pay such amount to any party.
    (2) With respect to recourse loans, the proceeds from the sale of 
the commodity:
    (i) If the value of the collateral at settlement is less than the 
amount due, the producer shall pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency 
and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or
    (ii) If the proceeds received from the sale of the commodity are 
greater than the sum of the amount due plus any cost incurred by CCC in 
conducting the sale of the commodity, the amount of such excess shall be 
paid to the producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of the 
producer.
    (3) If CCC sells the commodity described in paragraph (a)(1) or 
(a)(2) in settlement of the loan, the sales proceeds shall be applied to 
the amount owed CCC by the producer. The producer shall be responsible 
for any costs incurred by CCC in completing the sale. CCC may deduct 
such amount from the sales proceeds.
    (b) Settlements made by CCC with respect to eligible commodities 
that are acquired by CCC and that are stored in an approved warehouse 
shall be made on the basis of the entries set forth in the applicable 
warehouse receipt, supplemental certificate, and other accompanying 
documents.
    (c)(1) All eligible commodities that are stored in other than 
approved warehouses shall be delivered to CCC in accordance with 
instructions issued by CCC. Settlement for such commodities shall be 
made on the basis of entries set forth in the applicable warehouse 
receipt, supplemental certificate, and other accompanying documents.
    (2) With respect to all commodities, except peanuts, that are 
delivered from other than an approved warehouse, settlement shall be 
made by CCC on the basis of the basic loan rate that is in effect for 
the commodity at the producer's customary delivery point, as determined 
by CCC.
    (3)(i) With respect to peanuts, settlement values for quota and 
additional peanuts shall be determined and announced annually by CCC. 
Settlement

[[Page 338]]

shall be made by CCC on the amount computed on the basis of net weight 
and quality of such peanuts with an allowance of 4 percent for Virginia 
type peanuts and an allowance of 3.5 percent for other types of peanuts 
in order to compensate producers for shrinkage during storage on peanuts 
delivered on or after January 31 of the year following the year in which 
the crop was produced less discounts of:
    (A) $2 per ton, net weight, for each full 1 percent of foreign 
material in excess of 15 percent; and
    (B) $10 per ton, net weight, for peanuts containing more than 10 
percent moisture.
    (ii) No allowance for shrinkage shall be made for storage with 
respect to peanuts delivered before February 1 of the year following the 
year in which the crop was produced.
    (iii) If a producer delivers peanuts from a farm to CCC in a 
quantity that would exceed the farm poundage quota when added to the 
peanuts marketed, and considered marketed from the farm as quota 
peanuts, the additional peanut loan rate shall be used with respect to 
such peanuts if CCC determines that the producer made an inadvertent 
error in determining the quantity of peanuts pledged as collateral as 
quota peanuts. If CCC determines that such error was not inadvertent, a 
loan shall not be made available with respect to such quantity and 
marketing quota penalties shall be assessed in accordance with part 729 
of this title.
    (iv) The loan rate for additional peanuts shall be used for all 
peanuts that do not grade Segregation 1 at the time of delivery to CCC 
if the producer does not elect to settle such additional peanuts as 
quota peanuts. If the producer elects to settle such peanuts as quota 
peanuts, the quantity shall not exceed the lesser of:
    (A) The difference between the production of Segregation 1 peanuts 
on the farm and the farm poundage quota; or
    (B) The amount of the under-marketings of quota peanuts as shown on 
the farm marketing card.
    (4) With respect to rice acquired by CCC at a location other than an 
approved warehouse, settlement shall be made on the basis of the class, 
grade, and quality entries set forth in the Federal-State inspection 
certificate and on the basis of the quantity set forth in the weight 
certificates.
    (d) A producer may be required to retain and store the commodity 
that is pledged as collateral for a loan for a period of 60 days after 
the maturity date of a loan without any cost to CCC if CCC is unable to 
take delivery of the commodity. If CCC is unable to take delivery of the 
commodity within the 60-day period after the loan maturity date, the 
producer shall be paid a storage payment upon delivery of the commodity 
to CCC. The storage payment shall be computed at the storage rate stated 
in the applicable CCC storage agreement for the commodity in effect at 
the delivery point where the producer delivers the commodity. The period 
for earning such storage payment shall begin the day following the 
expiration of the 60-day period after such maturity date and extend 
through the earlier of:
    (1) The final date of actual delivery; or
    (2) The final date for delivery as specified in the delivery 
instructions issued to the producer by the county office.
    (e) When a producer is directed by the county office to haul the 
commodity for delivery, except aromatic rice, a greater distance than 
would have been necessary to make delivery to the producer's customary 
delivery point, as determined by CCC, the producer will be allowed 
compensation, as determined by the State committee at a rate not to 
exceed the common carrier truck rate or the rate available from local 
truckers, for hauling the eligible commodity the additional distance. In 
determining the rate of payment for excess hauling, the State committee 
may establish reasonable mileage minimums below which producers will not 
receive compensation for hauling.
    (f)(1) Producers may request trackloading for loan collateral where 
approved warehouse space is not available locally or where KCCO 
determines that it would be to the benefit of CCC. Where local weighing 
facilities are not available or when requested by producers, destination 
weights may be used for settlement purposes. All producers loading in 
the same car must sign an

[[Page 339]]

agreement stating the percentage share of the total quantity to be 
credited to each. When requested by producers before delivery of the 
commodity, settlement may be made on the basis of destination grades. 
Such destination grade determination for a car shall be applied to the 
entire quantity of a commodity loaded into the same car, regardless of 
the grade or quality of a commodity loaded into the car by any producer.
    (2) A trackloading payment of 19 cents per bushel (or 31.66 cents 
per hundredweight in the case of sorghum, oilseeds, and rice, excluding 
aromatic rice) shall be made to the producer on an eligible commodity 
delivered to CCC under this subsection.
    (g) If a farm-stored commodity is delivered in advance of the 
applicable loan maturity date as provided in Sec. 1421.19, a deduction 
for storage charges shall be made. The deduction shall be made for the 
period from the date of delivery to the applicable maturity date for the 
commodity. Such deduction shall be at the rate charged by the warehouse 
to which the commodity was delivered. No deduction for storage charges 
shall be made for early delivery of a farm-stored commodity if the loan 
maturity date is accelerated by CCC under a general acceleration of the 
maturity date in a particular area.
    (h) A refund of warehouse storage charges will be made by CCC to the 
producer if the maturity date of a warehouse storage loan is accelerated 
by CCC for reasons other than any wrongful act or omission on the part 
of the producer, and the commodity is not redeemed. The amount of the 
storage charges to be refunded shall be computed at the lesser of the 
UGRSA rate or the rate prepaid by the producer for the period of 
unearned storage.
    (i) If a warehouse charges the producer for either the receiving 
charges or the receiving and loading out charges on an eligible 
commodity in an approved warehouse, the producer shall, upon delivery to 
CCC of warehouse receipts representing the commodity stored in such 
warehouse, be reimbursed or given credit by the county office for such 
prepaid charges at the lesser of the UGRSA rate or the rate prepaid by 
the producer. The producer must furnish to the county office, written 
evidence signed by the warehouse operator that such charges have been 
paid.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.23  Foreclosure.

    (a) Upon maturity and nonpayment of a warehouse-stored loan, title 
to the unredeemed collateral securing the loan shall immediately vest in 
CCC. Upon maturity and nonpayment of farm-stored loan, title to the 
unredeemed collateral securing the loan shall vest in CCC upon demand. 
When CCC acquires title to the unredeemed collateral, CCC shall have no 
obligation to pay for any market value that such collateral may have in 
excess of the loan indebtedness, (the unpaid amount of the note and 
charges plus interest).
    (b) If the total amount due on a farm-stored loan (the unpaid amount 
of the note and charges, plus interest) is not satisfied upon maturity, 
CCC may remove the commodity from storage, and assign, transfer, and 
deliver the commodity or documents evidencing title thereto at such 
time, in such manner, and upon such terms as CCC may determine, at 
public or private sale. Any such disposition may also be effected 
without removing the commodity from storage. The commodity may be 
processed before sale and CCC may become the purchaser of the whole or 
any part of the commodity at either a public or private sale.
    (c) If a farm-stored commodity removed by CCC from storage is sold, 
the value of the settlement for the commodity shall be determined 
according to Sec. 1421.22. If a deficiency exists, the amount of the 
deficiency may be setoff from any payment that would otherwise be due 
the producer from CCC or any other agency of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.24  Protein determinations.

    (a) With respect to Hard Red Winter and Hard Red Spring wheat 
tendered to CCC that is stored in an approved warehouse, producers must 
obtain official protein content determinations or, if determined 
acceptable by CCC, protein content determinations arrived at by mutual 
agreement between the producer and the warehouse operator.

[[Page 340]]

Costs of such determinations shall not be paid by CCC.
    (b) With respect to farm-stored wheat, the basic loan rate shall not 
be adjusted to reflect the protein content.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.25  Loan repayments.

    (a) Rice market repayments.
    (1) A producer may repay a nonrecourse loan for a 1996 through 2002 
crop of rice at a rate that is the lesser of:
    (i) The loan rate and charges, plus interest determined for a crop; 
or
    (ii) The prevailing world market price, as determined by CCC.
    (2) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice shall be 
determined by the CCC based upon a review of prices at which rice is 
being sold in world markets and a weighting of such prices through the 
use of information such as changes in supply and demand of rice, tender 
offers, credit concessions, barter sales, government-to-government 
sales, special processing costs for coatings or premixes, and other 
relevant price indicators, and shall be expressed in U.S. equivalent 
values f.o.b. vessel, U.S. port of export, per hundredweight as follows:
    (i) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, long grain milled 
rice;
    (ii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, medium grain milled 
rice; and
    (iii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, short grain milled 
rice.
    (3) Export transactions involving rice and all other related market 
information will be monitored on a continuous basis for the purposes of 
paragraph (2). Relevant information may be obtained for this purpose 
from U.S. Department of Agriculture field reports, international 
organizations, public or private research entities, international rice 
brokers, and any other source of reliable information.
    (4) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice adjusted 
to U.S. quality and location (the adjusted world price (AWP)), that is 
determined in accordance with paragraph (5), shall be applicable to the 
provisions in this section.
    (5) The AWP for each class of rice shall equal the prevailing world 
market price for a class of rice (U.S. equivalent value) as determined 
in accordance with paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) and adjusted to U.S. 
quality and location as follows:
    (i) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice shall be 
adjusted to reflect an f.o.b. mill position by deducting from such 
calculated price an amount that is equal to the estimated national 
average costs associated with:
    (A) The use of bags for the export of U.S. rice, and
    (B) The transfer of such rice from a mill location to f.o.b. vessel 
at the U.S. port of export with such costs including, but not limited 
to, freight, unloading, wharfage, insurance, inspection, fumigation, 
stevedoring, interest, banking changes, storage, and administrative 
costs.
    (ii) The price determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(i) 
shall be adjusted to reflect the market value of the total quantity of 
whole kernels contained in such milled rice by deducting the world value 
of broken kernels contained therein, with such value of the broken 
kernels to be determined by multiplying the quantity of such broken 
kernels (4% per hundredweight) by the world market value of such broken 
kernels. The world market value of broken kernels shall be based upon 
the relationship of whole and broken kernel world prices as estimated 
from observations of prices at which rice is being sold in world 
markets.
    (iii) The price determined in accordance with (a)(5)(ii) shall be 
adjusted to reflect the per pound market value of whole kernels by 
dividing the price by the quantity of whole milled kernels contained in 
the milled rice (96% per hundredweight).
    (iv) The price determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(iii) 
shall be adjusted to reflect the market value of whole kernels contained 
in 100 pounds of rough rice by multiplying such price by the estimated 
national average quantity of whole kernel rice by class obtained from 
milling 100 pounds of rough rice.
    (v) The price determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(iv) 
shall be adjusted to reflect the total market value of rough rice by:
    (A) Adding to such price:
    (1) The market value of bran contained in the rough rice, computed 
by

[[Page 341]]

multiplying the domestic unit market value of bran by the estimated 
national average quantity of bran produced in milling 100 pounds of 
rice; and
    (2) The market value of broken kernels contained in the rough rice, 
computed by multiplying the estimated world market value of broken 
kernels by the estimated national average quantity of broken kernels 
produced in milling 100 pounds of rice;
    (B) Deducting from such price:
    (1) An estimated cost of milling rough rice; and
    (2) An estimated cost of transporting rough rice from farm to mill 
locations.
    (vi) The price determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(v) may 
be adjusted to a whole kernel loan rate basis by deducting the estimated 
world market value of the total quantity of broken kernels contained in 
such rice and dividing the resulting value by the estimated national 
average quantity of milled whole kernels produced in milling 100 pounds 
of rice.
    (6)(i) The adjusted world price for each class for rice, loan rate 
basis, shall be determined by CCC and shall be announced, to the extent 
practicable, on or after 3 p.m. eastern time each Tuesday, but may be 
announced more frequently, as determined by CCC, continuing through the 
later of:
    (A) The last Tuesday of July 2003; or
    (B) The last Tuesday of the latest month the 2002-crop rice loans 
mature.
    (ii) In the event that Tuesday is a non-workday, the determination 
will be made on the next workday, on or after 3 p.m. eastern time.
    (iii) The announced prices will be effective upon announcement and 
will remain in effect for a period as announced by the CCC.
    (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on the day 
of the announcement of the adjusted world price, between 2 p.m. eastern 
time and the time of the world price announcement, CCC will not accept 
repayments of rice loans at a world market price level not previously 
locked-in, and applications for lock-in of a rice loan repayment rate.
    (b) For 1996 through 2002 crops of barley, corn, grain sorghum, 
oats, wheat, and oilseeds, a producer may repay a nonrecourse loan at a 
rate that is the lesser of:
    (1) The loan rate and charges, plus interest determined for such 
crop; or
    (2) The alternative repayment rate for barley, corn, grain sorghum, 
oats, wheat, and oilseeds.
    (c) To the extent practicable, CCC shall determine and announce the 
alternative repayment rate, based upon the previous day's market prices 
at appropriate U.S. terminal markets as determined by CCC, adjusted to 
reflect quality and location for each crop of a commodity as follows:
    (1) On a weekly basis in each county for oilseeds, except soybeans; 
and
    (2) On a daily basis in each county for barley, corn, grain sorghum, 
oats, soybeans, and wheat.

Sec. 1421.26  Transfer of farm-stored loan to warehouse-stored association loan.

    Producers may deliver peanuts under a farm-stored loan to the 
association and obtain loan advances on such peanuts with the prior 
approval of the county office anytime on or before January 31 following 
the calendar year in which the crop was grown. Association advances 
shall be payable jointly to the producer and the CCC and shall be used 
to settle the farm-stored loan.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.27  Producer-handler purchases of additional peanuts pledged as collateral for a loan.

    (a) Producer-handlers may, at any time before loan maturity, forfeit 
their additional peanuts to CCC and immediately repurchase such peanuts 
from CCC by paying the amount necessary under the following sales 
policies:
    (1) For unrestricted use, at a price determined by CCC but, for the 
applicable type, not less than 105 percent of the quota loan rate, if 
purchased before December 31 of the calendar year in which the crop was 
grown, and at not less than 107 percent of the quota loan rate, if 
purchased after December 31 of the calendar year in which the crop was 
grown;
    (2) For edible export, at a price determined by CCC but not less 
than any minimum sales price determined and announced by CCC; and

[[Page 342]]

    (3) For crushing (either domestic or export), at a price determined 
by CCC but not less than the additional loan rate for the applicable 
type.
    (b) For purchases on or before January 31 following the calendar 
year in which the crop was grown, the county committee shall determine 
the sale price under the appropriate sales policy specified in paragraph 
(a). Loans will be settled at the county office, and amounts collected 
in excess of that necessary to settle loans will be remitted to the 
association for the respective area. The association will credit such 
amounts to the appropriate loan pool. The producer should be listed as a 
participant in the loan pool for the purpose of determining and 
distributing net gains from the loan pool.
    (c) For purchases after January 31 following the calendar year in 
which the crop was grown, the county committee shall determine the sale 
price under the appropriate sales policy specified in paragraph (a). Any 
amount collected in excess of the loan indebtedness shall accrue to CCC.

Sec. 1421.28  Required producer-handler records and supervision of farm-stored additional peanuts pledged as collateral for a loan or purchased by a producer-
          handler from loan.

    (a)(1) Each producer-handler shall maintain records as required in 
part 1446 of this chapter for all additional peanuts that are purchased 
and sold for which an ASCS-1007, Inspection Certificate and Sales 
Memorandum, is issued.
    (2) The following records shall be maintained for all peanuts 
purchased from CCC that are not inspected. Each producer-handler shall 
maintain records that show all sales and other disposals of peanuts. 
Such records shall show date of sale, quantity, type, and to whom sold. 
Records shall be maintained in such a manner that will enable the county 
office to readily reconcile quantities sold with all peanuts produced by 
the producer. All records shall be maintained for a period of three 
years following the end of the marketing year in which the peanuts were 
produced.
    (b)(1) The county office shall inspect and account for all 
additional peanuts pledged as collateral for a loan as determined 
necessary by the county committee.
    (2) The county office shall supervise the disposition of all 
additional peanuts purchased for use as seed and not inspected. The 
identical peanuts pledged as collateral for a loan must be disposed of 
and the producer must account for all peanuts that were under additional 
loan. The producer-handler shall request a county office representative 
to supervise the disposition of the peanuts and shall give the county 
office at least 3 working days notice of the date of such disposition. 
The county office shall determine the extent to which supervision is 
needed.
    (3) With respect to additional peanuts on which ASCS-1007 is issued, 
the producer-handler shall be subject to all provisions in part 1446 of 
this chapter relating to the disposition of additional peanuts.
    (c) The producer-handler shall pay all costs of supervision, as 
determined by the county committee for county office supervision when 
county office supervision is completed, and or determined by the 
association for peanuts supervised by association representatives when 
association supervision is completed.
    (d) The producer-handler is subject to penalties as provided in part 
1446 of this chapter with respect to any peanuts purchased in accordance 
with Sec. 1421.27.

Sec. 1421.29  Loan deficiency payments.

    (a) CCC will announce whether loan deficiency payments will be made 
available to producers on a farm for a specific crop for a crop year.
    (b) In order to be eligible to receive loan deficiency payments if 
such payments are made available for a crop, the producer of such 
commodity must:
    (1) Comply with all of the program requirements to be eligible to 
obtain loans in accordance with this part;
    (2) Agree to forego obtaining such loans;

[[Page 343]]

    (3) File and request payment on Form CCC-666 LDP, unless the 
producer enters into an agreement according to paragraph (h), for a 
quantity of an eligible commodity; and
    (4) Otherwise comply with all program requirements.
    (c) The loan deficiency payment rate for a crop shall be the amount 
by which the loan rate for the crop exceeds the rate at which CCC has 
announced that producers may repay their loans in accordance with 
Sec. 1421.25. Such rate shall be the amount determined on the day the 
producer submits a completed request for a loan deficiency payment to 
the county office. When such request is for rice and the request 
provides that the loan deficiency payment rate shall be based on the 
date of delivery, and the documentation of delivery indicates the rice 
was delivered after 3 p.m. eastern time, the loan deficiency payment 
rate in effect after 3 p.m. eastern time of the delivery date shall be 
used. In all other cases for rice where the loan deficiency payment rate 
is based on the delivery date, the payment rate in effect at 12:00:01 
a.m. eastern time of the delivery date shall be used.
    (d) The loan deficiency payment applicable to such crop shall be 
computed by multiplying the loan deficiency payment rate, as determined 
in accordance with paragraph (c), by the quantity of the crop the 
producer is eligible to pledge as collateral for a nonrecourse loan for 
which the loan deficiency payment is requested.
    (e) The total amount of loan deficiency payment a producer may 
receive is limited in accordance with the regulations at part 1400 of 
this chapter.
    (f) CCC will make the loan deficiency payment in accordance with 
paragraph (d). Notwithstanding any provisions in this part, a loan 
deficiency payment may be based on 100 percent of the net eligible 
quantity specified on acceptable evidence of production of the commodity 
certified as eligible for loan deficiency payment if such production 
evidence is provided for such commodity. If such production evidence is 
provided, CCC shall limit such increase in loan deficiency payment 
quantity to 110 percent of the quantity certified as eligible for such 
payment.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on the day 
of the announcement of the adjusted world price, applications for loan 
deficiency payments for rice that specify the payment rate will not be 
accepted between 2 p.m. eastern time and the time of the world price 
announcement.
    (h) If the producer enters into an agreement with CCC on or before 
the date of harvesting a quantity of an eligible commodity and the 
producer has the beneficial interest in such quantity as specified in 
accordance with Sec. 1421.5(c) on the date the commodity was harvested, 
the loan deficiency payment rate applicable to such commodity would be 
the loan deficiency payment rate based on the date the commodity was 
delivered to the processor, buyer, warehouse, or CMA. In such cases, the 
producer must meet all the other requirements in paragraph (b) on or 
before the final date to apply for a loan deficiency payment in 
accordance with Sec. 1421.5.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.30  Death, incompetency, or disappearance.

    In case of the death, incompetency, or disappearance of any producer 
who is entitled to the payment of any sum in settlement of a loan or 
loan deficiency payment, payment shall, upon proper application to the 
county office that made the loan or loan deficiency payment, be made to 
the persons who would be entitled to such producer's payment under the 
regulations contained in part 707 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.31  Recourse loans.

    (a) CCC shall make recourse loans available to eligible producers of 
high moisture corn and high moisture grain sorghum. Repayment of such 
recourse loans shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions set 
forth by CCC.
    (b) CCC may make recourse loans available to eligible producers with 
respect to commodities not specified in paragraph (a). Repayment of such 
recourse loans shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions set 
forth by CCC when the availability of such recourse loans is announced.
    (c) The value of the collateral for settlements described in 
paragraphs (a)

[[Page 344]]

and (b) shall be determined by CCC according to Sec. 1421.22.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.32  Handling payments and collections not exceeding $9.99.

    In order to avoid administrative costs of making small payments and 
handling small accounts, amounts of $9.99 or less that are due the 
producer will be paid only upon the producer's request. Deficiencies of 
$9.99 or less, including interest, may be disregarded unless demand for 
payment is made by CCC.

   Subpart--Standards for Approval of Warehouses for Grain, Rice, Dry 
                         Edible Beans, and Seed

    Source: 44 FR 67078, Nov. 23, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.5551  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the initial or continuing approval by 
the Commodity Credit Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of 
warehouse(s) for the storage and handling of:
    (1) Wheat, oats, corn, rye, barley, sorghums, flaxseed, soybeans, 
sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, safflower, mustard, and such other 
oilseeds as the Secretary may determine under a Uniform Grain Storage 
Agreement (which commodities are hereinafter referred to as ``grain''),
    (2) Rough rice under a Uniform Rice Storage Agreement,
    (3) Milled rice under a Milled Rice Storage Agreement,
    (4) Dry Edible Beans under a Bean Storage Agreement, and
    (5) Seed under a Seed Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or 
held by CCC as security for price support loans.

This subpart is not applicable to grain, rough and milled rice, dry 
edible beans, and seed purchased in store for prompt shipment or to 
handling operations of a temporary nature.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by KCCO and a storage contract or 
agreement must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC 
will use such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering 
into of a storage contract or agreement does not constitute a commitment 
that CCC will use the warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman, when applying for approval under this subpart, 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-24, ``Application for Approval of Warehouse 
for Grain, Rice, Dry Edible Beans, and Seed'', and a completed Form CCC-
24-1, ``Supplement to Application for Approval of Warehouse for Grain, 
Rice, Dry Edible Beans, and Seed'',
    (2) A current financial statement prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles meeting the following 
requirements:
    (i) Each financial statement shall include, but not be limited to 
the following:
    (A) A balance sheet;

[[Page 345]]

    (B) A statement of income (profit and loss);
    (C) Statement of retained earnings; and
    (D) A statement of changes in the financial position.
    (ii) Each financial statement shall be accompanied by one of the 
following:
    (A) A report of audit or review conducted by an independent CPA or 
an independent public accountant in accordance with standards 
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
The accountant's report of audit or review shall include the 
accountant's certifications, assurances, opinions, comments, and notes 
with respect to such financial statement, or
    (B) A compilation report of the financial statement which is 
prepared by a grain commission firm or a management firm if such firm 
has been authorized by the Deputy Vice President, CCC (Deputy 
Administrator, Commodity Operations, FSA) to provide a compilation 
report of financial statements of warehousemen.
    (iii) All financial statements shall be accompanied by a 
certification by the chief executive officer of the warehouseman, under 
penalty of perjury, that the financial statement(s) accurately reflects 
the financial condition of the warehouseman for the period specified in 
such statement.
    (iv) A current financial statement on Form WA-51-2, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51-2 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.
    (v) Only one financial statement is required for a chain of 
warehouses owned or operated by a single business entity. If approved by 
the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee, the financial statement 
of a parent company, which includes the financial position of a wholly-
owned subsidiary, may be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for 
the wholly-owned subsidiary.
    (3) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1421.5552(a)(2) and such 
other documents or information as CCC may require.
    (e) The provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall also be 
applicable to warehousemen who have an existing storage contract with 
CCC. Such warehousemen with existing storage contracts shall submit 
their financial statements to CCC in the manner prescribed reflecting 
their financial condition as of the close of the warehouseman's fiscal 
or calendar year's operation, whichever is applicable. Thereafter, the 
financial statements and the audit, review or compilation reports shall 
be furnished annually to reflect the warehouseman's fiscal or calendar 
year's operation, whichever is applicable, and at such other times as 
may be required by the AMS or CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.5552  Basic standards.

    Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, each warehouseman and 
each of the warehouses owned or operated by such warehouseman for which 
CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC owned or loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for 
hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a 
corporation, shall be authorized by its charter to engage in such 
business,
    (2) Have a current and valid license for the kind of storage 
operation for which the warehouseman seeks approval if such a license is 
required by State or local laws or regulations,
    (3) Have a net worth which is the greater of $50,000 or an amount 
which is computed by multiplying the maximum storage capacity of the 
warehouse (the total quantity of the commodity which the warehouseman 
desires to store and which the warehouse can accommodate when stored in 
the customary manner) under the approved contract with CCC times twenty-
five (25) cents per bushel in the case of

[[Page 346]]

grain, fifty (50) cents per hundredweight in the case of rough rice, 
eighty-five (85) cents per hundredweight in the case of milled rice, and 
sixty (60) cents per hundredweight in the case of dry edible beans. In 
the case of seed, the net worth of the warehouseman shall be at least 
equal to an amount which is computed by multiplying the estimated number 
of pounds of seed to be stored times seven (7) cents per pound. If this 
calculated net worth requirement exceeds $50,000, the warehouseman may 
satisfy any deficiency in net worth between the $50,000 minimum 
requirement and such calculated net worth requirement by furnishing 
bonds, irrevocable letters of credit, or other acceptable substitute 
security meeting the requirements of Sec. 1421.5553.
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating 
expenses,
    (5) Have satisfactorily corrected upon request by CCC, any 
deficiencies in the performance of any storage contract or agreement 
with CCC,
    (6) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,
    (7) Use only prenumbered warehouse receipts and scale tickets,
    (8) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable 
firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored 
commodity, and
    (9) Have a work force and equipment available to complete load out 
within sixty (60) working days of that quantity of grain, rice, beans, 
or seed for which the warehouse is or may be approved under the Uniform 
Grain Storage Agreement, Uniform Rice Storage Agreement, Milled Rice 
Storage Agreement, Bean Storage Agreement, or Seed Storage Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the load out capacity 
of any warehouse at a single location need not exceed the equivalent of 
200 railroad cars per day.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall have the 
necessary experience, organization, technical qualifications, and skills 
in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodities to 
enable them to provide proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials, and each of the supervisory employees 
of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall:
    (1) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and 
performance, and
    (2) Be neither suspended nor debarred under applicable CCC 
suspension and debarment regulations.
    (d) The warehouse shall:
    (1) Be of sound construction, in good state of repair, and 
adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the 
applicable commodity,
    (2) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all 
times, and
    (3) Not be subject to greater than normal risk of fire, flood, or 
other hazards.

<R05>
Sec. 1421.5553  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process in the State where the warehouse is located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC,
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than ninety (90) days or 
includes a

[[Page 347]]

rider providing for not less than ninety (90) days' notice to CCC before 
cancellation. Excess coverage on a substitute bond for one warehouse 
will not be accepted or applied by CCC against insufficient bond 
coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage contract or agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

22, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 1421.5554  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage or handling of commodities and periodically thereafter 
to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1421.5555  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart:
    (a) The financial, bond, and original and periodic warehouse 
examination provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman 
approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of 
commodities under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under the 
U.S. Warehouse Act for such commodities but a special examination shall 
be made of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is 
necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $50,000 but who 
fails or whose warehouse fails to meet one or more of the other 
standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity, and
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

[44 FR 67078, Nov, 23, 1979, as amended at 51 FR 32627, Sept. 15, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1421.5556  Approval of warehouses, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart, and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. The notice will state the cause(s) for such action. Unless 
the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:

[[Page 348]]

    (1) In Sec. 1421.5552, other than the standard set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after 
receiving notice of such action, request reconsideration of the action 
and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of 
such request. The Director shall consider such information in making a 
determination and notify the warehouseman in writing of such 
determination. The warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's 
determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal 
hearing thereon by filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as 
``FSA''). The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, 
nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the 
hearing shall be as prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 
7 CFR part 780. When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman 
shall be considered as a ``participant''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1421.5552(c)(2), the warehouseman's administrative 
appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in 
accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period 
of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

[Amdt. 4, 50 FR 29640, July 22, 1985]

Sec. 1421.5557  Exemption from requirements.

    If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of the subpart and no reasonable and economic alternative is 
available for securing such services for commodities under CCC programs, 
the President or Executive Vice President, CCC, may temporarily exempt, 
in writing, applicants for storage agreements and warehousemen who are 
currently under contract with CCC in such area from one or more of the 
standards of this subpart and may establish such other standards as are 
considered necessary to satisfactorily safeguard the interests of CCC.

Sec. 1421.5558  Contract and application and inspection fees.

    (a) Each warehouseman who has a non-federally licensed grain or rice 
warehouse in States that do not have a Cooperative Agreement with CCC 
for warehouse examinations must pay an annual contract fee to CCC for 
each such warehouse which is approved by CCC or for which CCC approval 
is sought as follows:
    (1) A warehouseman who has an existing agreement with CCC for the 
storage or handling of CCC-owned commodities or commodities pledged to 
CCC as loan collateral must pay an annual contract fee for each 
warehouse approved under that agreement in advance of the renewal date 
of such agreement.
    (2) All grain and rice warehousemen who do not have an existing 
agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned commodities 
or commodities pledged to CCC as loan collateral but who desire such an 
agreement must pay an application and inspection fee for each warehouse 
for which CCC approval is sought prior to CCC conducting the original 
warehouse examination. The annual contract fee must be paid by the 
warehouseman to CCC prior to the time that the agreement is entered 
into.
    (3) The contract fee will be prorated based upon the total number of 
months for which the contract is to be effective.
    (4) CCC may, upon the request of a warehouseman, conduct an 
examination of a warehouse for the sole benefit of the warehouseman and 
such warehouseman shall pay to CCC a fee equal to 1\1/2\ times the 
amount of the warehouseman's annual contract fee for such examination.
    (b) Any subsequent changes in the contract and application fees 
shall be announced in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 1423.1  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the approval by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of warehouse(s) for the 
storage and handling of:
    (1) Dry or refrigerated processed agricultural commodities under a 
Processed Commodities Storage Agreement (hereinafter referred to as 
``processed commodities''),
    (2) Bulk oils, under a Contract or Agreement for Tank Storage, which 
are owned by CCC or held by CCC as collateral for price support loans, 
and
    (3) Extracted Honey (hereinafter referred to as ``honey'') under a 
Honey Storage Agreement, either in bulk or in containers meeting 
specifications in the applicable honey price support regulations, which 
is owned by CCC or held by CCC as security for price support loans. This 
subpart shall not apply to processed commodities, extracted honey, and 
bulk oils purchased in store by CCC for prompt shipment or to handling 
of commodities.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by KCCO and a storage contract or 
agreement must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC 
will use such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering 
into of a storage contract or agreement does not constitute a commitment 
that CCC will use the warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman when applying for approval under this subpart, 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-560, ``Application for Approval of 
Warehouse (Processed Commodities)'', or Form CCC-513, ``Application for 
Approval of Tank Farm'', or Form CCC-55, ``Application for Approval of 
Warehouse for Honey Storage Contract'', whichever is applicable,
    (2) A current financial statement on Form WA-51, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee. 
Financial statements shall show the financial condition of the 
warehouseman as of a date no earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the 
date of the warehouseman's application, or such other date as CCC may 
prescribe. Additional financial statements shall be furnished annually 
and

[[Page 350]]

at such other times as CCC may require. CCC also may require that 
financial statements prepared by the warehouseman or by a public 
accountant be examined by an independent certified public accountant in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Only one 
financial statement is required for a chain of warehouses owned or 
operated by a single business entity. If approved by the Director, KCCO, 
or the Director's designee, the financial statement of a parent company, 
which includes the financial position of a wholly-owned subsidiary, may 
be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for the wholly-owned 
subsidiary.
    (3) Copies of the warehouseman's tariff and any changes thereto, and
    (4) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1423.2(a)(2) and such other

Sec. 1423.2  Basic standards.

    Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, each warehouseman and 
each of the warehouses owned or operated by such warehouseman for which 
CCC approval is sought for the storage or handling of CCC-owned or loan 
commodities shall meet the following standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for 
hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a 
corporation, shall be authorized by its charter to engage in such 
business.
    (2) Have a current and valid license for the kind of storage 
operation for which the warehouseman seeks approval if such a license is 
required by State or local laws or regulations.
    (3) Have a net worth which is the greater of $25,000 or (i) for 
dairy and other processed commodities (other than those shown in

multiplying five (5) percent of the current purchase price, times the 
quantity of the commodity to be stored; (ii) for honey, sugar and bulk 
oils, the amount which results from multiplying the storage capacity of 
the flat warehouse space available to CCC or the maximum capacity of the 
bulk tank(s), whichever is applicable, times five (5) percent of the 
current loan value for honey and sugar and five (5) percent of the 
current market value for bulk oils. The net worth need not exceed 
$250,000. If the calculated net worth exceeds $25,000, the warehouseman 
may satisfy any deficiency in net worth between the $25,000 minimum 
requirement and such calculated net worth by furnishing bonds (or 
acceptable substitute security) meeting the requirements of Sec. 1423.3,
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating 
expenses,
    (5) Have satisfactory corrected, upon request by CCC, any 
deficiencies in the performance of any storage contract or agreement

prescribe,
    (7) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,
    (8) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable 
firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored 
commodity, and
    (9) Have a work force and equipment available to complete loadout as

    (i) Forty-five (45) working days of the total quantity of all honey 
and processed commodities stored for CCC.
    (ii) Seventy-five (75) working days of that quantity of bulk oils 
for which the warehouse is or may be approved under a contract with CCC.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall have the 
necessary experience, organization technical qualifications, and skills 
in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodity to enable 
them to provide proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials, and each of the supervisory employees 
of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operations shall:
    (1) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and 
performance, and

suspension and debarment regulations.
    (d) The warehouse shall:
    (1) Be of sound construction, in good state of repair, and 
adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the 
applicable commodity,
    (2) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all 
times. If a warehouse is leased by the warehouseman, a copy of the 
written lease agreement must be furnished to CCC at the time the 
warehouseman applies for approval under this subpart. The lease

Sec. 1423.3  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process in the State where the warehouse is located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC.
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and
    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than one hundred twenty (120) 
days or includes a rider providing for not less than one hundred twenty 
(120) days' notice to CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a 
substitute bond for one warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC 
against insufficient bond coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage contract or agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

Sec. 1423.4  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage or handling of commodities and periodically thereafter 
to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and requirements.

[[Page 352]]


<R05>
Sec. 1423.5  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart:
    (a) The financial, bond, and original and periodic warehouse 
examination provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman 
approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of 
commodities under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under the 
U.S. Warehouse Act for such commodities, but a special examination shall 
be made of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is 
necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $25,000 but who 
fails, or whose warehouse fails, to meet one or more of the other 
standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity, and
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1423.6  Approval of warehouse, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart; and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. The notice will state the cause(s) for such action. Unless 
the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.
    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1423.2, other than the standard set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after receiving notice 
of such action, request reconsideration of the action and present to the 
Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of such request. The 
Director shall consider such information in making a determination and 
notify the warehouseman in writing of such determination. The 
warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's determination, 
obtain a review of the determination and an informal hearing thereon by 
filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, 
Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as ``FSA''). The time of 
filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, nature of the informal 
hearing, determination and reopening of the hearing shall be as 
prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 7 CFR part 780. 
When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman shall be 
considered as a ``participant'''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1423.2(c)(2), the warehouseman's administrative appeal 
rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in accordance 
with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period of 
suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

[Amdt. 3, 50 FR 42513, Oct. 21, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 1423.7  Exemption from requirements.

    (a) If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of this subpart, and no reasonable and economical alternative 
is available for securing such services, the President or Executive Vice 
President, CCC, may exempt, in writing, applicants in such area from one 
or more of the standards of this subpart and may establish such other 
standards as are considered necessary to safeguard satisfactorily the 
interests of CCC.

[[Page 353]]

    (b) Warehousemen who are currently under contract with CCC will be 
required to meet the terms and conditions of these regulations at the 
time of renewal of their contract.

producer has certified to the CMA that the commodity is eligible for 
loan, and there is no market gain or LDP involved in the loan pool for 
the crop year.
    (e) A CMA may, for a period of time as specified in Handbook 1-CMA, 
include a commodity that is ineligible based on FSA records when the 
producer has certified to the CMA the commodity is eligible. In these 
instances, CCC specifies a time period during which CMA's may obtain 
loan or LDP's on the applicable quantity while the eligibility status is 
resolved. If the final resolution is that the commodity was ineligible, 
the CMA must repay any loans outstanding with principal plus interest 
and any market gains obtained plus interest from the date of receiving 
the market gain through the repayment date.

agreements or the CMA shall obtain a completed form CCC-679, Lien

CMA shall provide CCC the completed CCC-679. CMA's shall not take any 
action to cause a lien or encumbrance to be placed on a commodity after 
a loan is approved.
    (k) If a loan or LDP is obtained for any quantity in a loan pool, 
allocations of costs and expenses among separate pools for the commodity 
in the pool shall be made according to generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (l) A CMA shall not apply marketing losses from a commodity not used 
to obtain a loan or LDP against the marketing proceeds of a commodity 
used to obtain a loan or LDP.
    (m) CMA's shall not carry forward losses from one loan pool and 
apply them against a subsequent loan pool without CCC's authorization. 
CCC may grant authorization when it determines that carrying forward the 
loss complies with CCC's loan and LDP program intent.
    (n) The CMA is responsible to CCC for any loss related to 
commodities the CMA pledged as collateral for loan or used to obtain LDP 
related to:

proceeds from CCC, except when loans are redeemed within 15 work days of 
the date of the loan.
    (2) CMA's may credit advances to its members made before loans and 
LDP's are obtained against the distribution of loan and LDP proceeds 
requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, loan 
pool proceeds shall not be combined with non-loan pool proceeds and the 
CMA shall distribute loan pool proceeds according to the information it 
provided CCC in accordance with Sec. 1425.4(b)(7).
    (2) Sales proceeds from a loan pool may be combined with sales 
proceeds from other pools if the proceeds from such pools are allocated

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase, 
title; risk of loss; and beneficial interest in the commodity, as 
specified in 7 CFR part 1427, shall remain with the producer until the 
buyer exercises this option to purchase the commodity. This option to 
purchase shall expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either 
the producer or the buyer, at the earlier of: (1) The maturity of any 
Commodity Credit Corporation loan which is secured by such commodity; 
(2) the date the Commodity Credit Corporation claims title to such 
commodity; or (3) such other date as provided in this option.

    (ii) Enters into a contract to sell the cotton if the producer 
retains title, risk of loss, and beneficial interest in the commodity 
and the purchaser does not pay to the producer any advance payment 
amount to enter into such contract, except as provided in part 1425 of 
this chapter; or
    (iii) Executes Form CCC-605, Designation of Agent. Such designation:
    (A) Allows the producer to authorize an agent or subsequent agent to 
redeem all or a portion of the cotton pledged as collateral for a loan;
    (B) Identifies the warehouse receipts for which the authorization is 
given;

[[Page 364]]

    (C) Expires upon maturity of the loan;
    (D) Allows agents so designated by the producer to designate a 
subsequent agent by endorsement of the form by the agent;
    (E) Must be presented at the time the loan is repaid at the county 
office or loan servicing agent where the loan originated if the agent or 
subsequent agent exercises any authority granted by the producer; and
    (F) May be canceled by the producer by providing the custodial 
office a written request signed and dated by the producer showing the 
name of the agent, the loan number, and the bales applicable to the Form 
CCC-605. The effective date of the cancellation shall be the date the 
request is received by the custodial office.
    (3) If loans or loan deficiency payments are made available to 
producers through a CMA, the beneficial interest in the cotton must 
always have been in the producer-member who delivered the cotton to the 
CMA or its member cooperative, except as otherwise provided in this 
section. Cotton delivered to such a CMA shall not be eligible to receive 
a loan or a loan deficiency payment if the producer-member who delivered 
the cotton does not retain the right to share in the proceeds from the 
marketing of the cotton as provided in part 1425 of this chapter.
    (f) If the person tendering cotton for a loan or a loan deficiency 
payment is a landowner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper, such cotton 
must represent such person's separate share of the crop and must not 
have been acquired by such person directly or indirectly from a 
landowner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper.
    (g) Each bale of upland cotton sampled by the warehouse operator 
upon initial receipt which has not been sampled by the ginner must not 
show more than one sample hole on each side of the bale. If more than 
one sample is desired when the bale is received by the warehouse 
operator, the sample shall be cut across the width of the bale, broken 
in half or split lengthwise, and otherwise drawn in accordance with AMS 
dimension and weight requirements. This requirement will not prohibit 
sampling of the cotton at a later date if authorized by the producer.

Sec. 1427.6  Disbursement of loans.

    (a) Disbursement of loans to individual producers may be made by:
    (1) County offices;
    (2) Loan servicing agent; or
    (3) An approved cotton clerk who has entered into a written 
agreement with CCC on Form CCC-810.
    (b) Loan proceeds may be disbursed by CCC or a servicing bank agent 
bank to CMA's.
    (c) The loan documents shall not be presented for disbursement 
unless the cotton covered by the mortgage or pledged as security is 
eligible in accordance with Sec. 1427.5. If the cotton was not eligible 
cotton at the time of disbursement, the total amount disbursed under the 
loan, and charges plus interest shall be refunded promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.7  Maturity of loans.

    (a)(1) Form A loans and Form G loans mature on demand by CCC and no 
later than the last day of the 10th calendar month from the first day of 
the month in which the loan or loan advance is disbursed.
    (2) CCC may at any time accelerate the loan maturity date by 
providing the producer notice of such acceleration at least 30 days in 
advance of the accelerated maturity date.
    (b) If the loan is not repaid by the loan maturity date, title to 
the cotton shall vest in CCC the day after such maturity date and CCC 
shall have no obligation to pay for any market value which such cotton 
may have in excess of the amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.8  Amount of loan.

    (a) The loan rates for crops of upland cotton and ELS cotton will be 
determined and announced by CCC and made available at State and county 
offices.
    (b) The quantity of cotton which may be pledged as collateral for a 
loan shall be the net weight of the eligible cotton as shown on the 
warehouse receipt issued by an approved warehouse, except that in the 
case of a bale which has a net weight of more than 600

[[Page 365]]

pounds, the weight to be used in determining the amount of the loan on 
the bale shall be 600 pounds. Cotton pledged as collateral for loans on 
the basis of reweights will not be accepted by CCC.
    (c) The amount of the loan for each bale will be determined by 
multiplying the net weight of the bale, as determined under paragraph 
(b) by the applicable loan rate.
    (d) CCC will not increase the amount of the loan made with respect 
to any bale of cotton as a result of a redetermination of the quantity 
or quality of the bale after it is tendered to CCC, except that if it is 
established to the satisfaction of CCC that a bona fide error was made 
with respect to the weight of the bale or the classification for the 
bale, such error may be corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.9  Classification of cotton.

    (a) References made to ``classification'' in this subpart shall 
include grade, staple length, and micronaire, and for upland cotton, 
leaf, extraneous matter, and strength readings. All cotton tendered for 
loan must be classed by an Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Cotton 
Classing Office (Cotton Classing Office) or other entity approved by CCC 
and tendered on the basis of such classification.
    (b) An AMS cotton classification or other entity's classification 
acceptable by CCC showing the classification of a bale must be based 
upon a representative sample drawn from the bale in accordance with 
instructions to samplers drawing samples under the Smith-Doxey program.
    (c) If the producer's cotton has not been classed or sampled in a 
manner acceptable by CCC, the warehouse shall sample such cotton and 
forward the samples to the Cotton Classing Office or other entity 
approved by CCC serving the district in which the cotton is located. 
Such warehouse must be licensed by AMS or be approved by CCC to draw 
samples for submission to the Cotton Classing Office or other entity 
approved by CCC.
    (d) If a sample has been submitted for classification, another 
sample shall not be drawn, except for a review classification.
    (e) Where review classification is not involved, if through error or 
otherwise two or more samples from the same bale are submitted for 
classification, the loan rate shall be based on the classification 
having the lower loan value.
    (f) If a review classification is obtained, the loan value of the 
cotton represented thereby will be based on such review classification.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.10  Approved storage.

    (a) Eligible cotton may be pledged as collateral for loans only if 
stored at warehouses approved by CCC.
    (1) Persons desiring approval of their facilities should communicate 
with the Kansas City Commodity Office, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, 
Missouri 64141-6205.
    (2) The names of approved warehouses may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office or from State or county offices.
    (b) When the operator of a warehouse receives notice from CCC that a 
loan has been made by CCC on a bale of cotton, the operator shall, if 
such cotton is not stored within the warehouse, promptly place such 
cotton within such warehouse.
    (c) Warehouse charges paid by a producer will not be refunded by 
CCC.
    (d) The approved storage requirements provided in this section may 
be waived by CCC if the producer requests a loan deficiency payment 
pursuant to the loan deficiency payment provisions contained in 
Sec. 1427.23.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.11  Warehouse receipts.

    (a) Producers may obtain loans on eligible cotton represented by 
warehouse receipts only if the warehouse receipts meet the definition of 
a warehouse receipt and provide for delivery of the cotton to bearer or 
are properly assigned by endorsement in blank, so as to vest title in 
the holder of the receipt or are otherwise acceptable to CCC. The 
warehouse receipt must:
    (1) Contain the gin bale number;
    (2) Contain the warehouse receipt number;
    (3) Be dated on or prior to the date the producer signs the note and 
security agreement.
    (b) Warehouse receipts, in accordance with Sec. 1427.3, when issued 
as block

[[Page 366]]

warehouse receipts will be accepted when authorized by CCC only if the 
owner of the warehouse issuing the block warehouse receipt owns the 
cotton represented by the block warehouse receipt and the warehouse is 
not licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.
    (c)(1) Each receipt must set out in its written or printed terms the 
tare and the net weight of the bale represented thereby. The net weight 
shown on the warehouse receipt shall be the difference between the gross 
weight as determined by the warehouse at the warehouse site and the tare 
weight. The warehouse receipt may show the net weight established at a 
gin if:
    (i) The gin is in the immediate vicinity of the warehouse and is 
operated under common ownership with such warehouse or in any other case 
in which the showing of gin weights on the warehouse receipts is 
approved by CCC; and
    (ii) Gin weights are permitted by the licensing authority for the 
warehouse.
    (2) The tare shown on the receipt shall be the tare furnished to the 
warehouse by the ginner or entered by the ginner on the gin bale tag. A 
machine card type warehouse receipt reflecting an alteration in gross, 
tare, or net weight will not be accepted by CCC unless it bears, on the 
face of the receipt, the following legend or similar wording approved by 
CCC, duly executed by the warehouse or an authorized representative of 
the warehouse:

    Corrected (gross, tare, or net) weight,
    (Name of warehouse),
    By (Signature or initials),
    Date.

    (3) Alterations in other inserted data on a machine card type 
warehouse receipt must be initialed by an authorized representative of 
the warehouse.
    (d) If warehouse storage charges have been paid, the receipt must 
show that date through which the storage charges have been paid.
    (e) If warehouse receiving charges have been paid or waived, the 
warehouse receipt must show such fact. Except for bales stored in the 
States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Virginia, if receiving charges due on the bale include a charge, if any, 
for a new set of ties for compressing flat bales tied with ties which 
cannot be reused, the warehouse receipt must indicate the receiving 
charges and include a charge for new set of ties. If the bale is stored 
at a warehouse not having compress facilities and bales shipped from the 
warehouse are normally compressed in transit, the warehouse receipt must 
show the bale ties are not suitable for reuse when the bale is 
compressed and charges will be assessed by the nearest compress in line 
of transit for furnishing new bale ties.
    (f) In any case where loan collateral is forfeited, any unpaid 
storage or receiving charges will be paid to the warehouse by CCC after 
loan maturity or as soon as practicable after the cotton is ordered 
shipped by CCC.
    (g) The warehouse receipt must show the compression status of the 
bale; i.e., flat, modified flat, standard, gin standard, standard 
density (short), gin universal, universal density (short), or warehouse 
universal density. The receipt must show if the compression charge has 
been paid, or if the warehouse claims no lien for such compression.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.12  Liens.

    If there are any liens or encumbrances on the cotton tendered as 
collateral for a loan, waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC 
must be obtained before disbursement even though the liens or 
encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional liens 
or encumbrances shall be placed on the cotton after the loan is 
approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.13  Fees, charges and interest.

    (a) A producer shall pay a nonrefundable loan service fee to CCC or, 
if applicable, to a loan servicing agent, at a rate determined by CCC. 
Any such fee shall be in addition to any cotton clerk fee paid to a 
cotton clerk in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The 
amount of such fees is available in State and county offices and are 
shown on the note and security agreement and shall be deducted from the 
loan proceeds.
    (b) Cotton clerks may only charge fees for the preparation of loan 
or loan

[[Page 367]]

deficiency payment documents at the rate determined by CCC.
    (1) Such fees may be deducted from the loan or loan deficiency 
payment proceeds instead of the fees being paid in cash.
    (2) The amount of such fees is available in State and county offices 
and is shown on the note and security agreement.
    (c) Interest which accrues with respect to a loan shall be 
determined in accordance with part 1405 of this chapter. All or a 
portion of such interest may be waived with respect to a quantity of 
upland cotton which has been redeemed in accordance with Sec. 1427.19 at 
a level which is less than the principal amount of the loan plus charges 
and interest.
    (d) For each crop of upland cotton, the producer, as defined in the 
Cotton Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. Chapter 2101), shall remit 
to CCC an assessment which shall be transmitted by CCC to the Cotton 
Board and shall be deducted from the:
    (1) Loan proceeds for a crop of cotton and shall be at a rate equal 
to one dollar per bale plus up to one percent of the loan amount; and
    (2) Loan deficiency payment proceeds for a crop of cotton and shall 
be at a rate equal to up to one percent of the loan deficiency payment 
amount.
    (e) If the producers elects to forfeit the loan collateral to CCC, 
the producer shall pay to CCC, at the rates that are specified in the 
storage agreement between the warehouse and CCC, the following accrued 
warehouse charges:
    (1) All warehouse storage charges associated with the forfeited 
cotton that accrued before the period the cotton was pledged as 
collateral for the loan; and
    (2) Any accrued warehouse receiving charges associated with the 
forfeited cotton, including, if applicable, charges for new ties as 
specified in Sec. 1427.11.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.14  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.15  Special procedure where funds are advanced.

    (a) This special procedure is provided to assist persons or firms 
which, in the course of their regular business of handling cotton for 
producers, have made advances to eligible producers on eligible cotton

person, firm, or financial institution which has made advances to 
eligible producers on eligible cotton may also obtain reimbursement for 
the amounts advanced under this procedure.
    (b) This special procedure shall apply only:
    (1) If such person or firm is entitled to reimbursement from the 
proceeds of the loans or loan deficiency payments for the amounts 
advanced and has been authorized by the producer to deliver the loan or 
loan deficiency payment documents to a county office for disbursement of 
the loans or loan deficiency payments; and
    (2) To loan or loan deficiency payment documents covering cotton on 
which a person or firm has advanced to the producers, including payments 
to prior lienholders and other creditors, the note amounts shown on the 
Form A loan, except for:
    (i) Authorized cotton clerk fees;
    (ii) The research and promotion fee to be collected for transmission 
to the Cotton Board by CCC; and
    (iii) CCC loan service charges.
    (c)(1) All loan or loan deficiency payment documents shall be mailed 
or delivered to the appropriate county office and shall show the entire 
proceeds of the loans or loan deficiency payments, except for CCC loan 
service charges and research and promotion fees, for disbursement to:
    (i) The financial institution which is to allow credit to the person 
or firm which made the loan or loan deficiency payment advances or to 
such financial institution and such person or firm as joint payees; or
    (ii) The person, firm, or financial institution which made the loan 
or loan deficiency payment advances to the producers.
    (2) The documents shall be accompanied by Form CCC-825, Transmittal 
Schedule of Loan and Loan Deficiency Payment Documents, in original and 
two copies, numbered serially for each county office by the person, 
firm, or financial institution which made the loan or loan deficiency

the amounts invested by the person, firm, or financial institution in 
the loans or loan deficiency payments.
    (3) Upon receipt of the loan or loan deficiency payment documents 
and Form CCC-825, the county office will stamp one copy of the Form CCC-
825 to indicate receipt of the documents and return this copy to the 
person, firm, or financial institution.
    (d) County offices will review the loan or loan deficiency payment 
documents prior to disbursement and will return to the person, firm, or 
financial institution any documents determined not to be acceptable 
because of errors or illegibility. County offices will disburse the

payment documents are acceptable by issuance of one check to the payee 
indicated on the applicable form and will mail the check to the address 
shown for such payee on the applicable form with a copy of Form CCC-825. 
The Form CCC-825 will show the date of disbursement by a county office 
and amount of interest earned by the person, firm, or financial 
institution.
    (e) The person, firm, or financial institution shall be deemed to 
have invested funds in the loans or loan deficiency payment as of the 
date loan or loan deficiency payment documents acceptable to CCC were 
delivered to a county office or, if received by mail, the date of 
mailing as indicated by postmark or the date of receipt in a county 
office if no postmark date is shown. Patron postage meter date stamp 
will not be recognized as a postmark date.
    (f) Interest will be computed on the total amount invested by the 
person, firm, or financial institution in the loan or loan deficiency 
payment represented by accepted documents from and including the date of 
investment of funds by the person, firm, or financial institution to, 
but not including, the date of disbursement by a county office.
    (1) Interest will be paid at the rate in effect for CCC loans as 
provided in part 1405 of this chapter.
    (2) Interest earned by the person, firm, or financial institution on 
the investment in loans disbursed during a month will be paid by county 
offices after the end of the month.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.16  Reconcentration of cotton.

    (a) CCC may under certain conditions, before loan maturity, 
compress, store, insure, or reinsure the cotton against any risk, or 
otherwise handle or deal with the cotton as it may deem necessary or 
appropriate for the purpose of protecting the interest therein of the 
producer or CCC.
    (b) CCC may reconcentrate the cotton pledged for the loan from one 
CCC-approved warehouse to another with the written consent of the 
producer and upon the request of the local warehouse and certification 
that there is congestion and lack of storage facilities in the area. 
However, if CCC determines such loan cotton is improperly warehoused and 
subject to damage, or if any of the terms of the loan agreement are 
violated, or if carrying charges are substantially in excess of the 
average of carrying charges available elsewhere and the local warehouse, 
after notice, declines to reduce such charges, such written consent need 
not be obtained.
    (1) The county office, loan servicing agent, or CMA shall arrange 
for reconcentration of the cotton under the direction of the Kansas City 
Commodity Office.
    (2) Any fees, costs, or expenses incident to such actions shall be 
charges against the cotton.
    (3) After the cotton is reconcentrated, the Kansas City Commodity 
Office shall obtain new warehouse receipts, allocate to individual 
bales, shipping and other charges incurred against the cotton, and 
return new warehouse receipts and reconcentration charges applicable to 
each bale to the county office, loan servicing agent, or CMA. Such 
reconcentration charges shall be added to bale loan amounts and must be 
repaid for bales redeemed from loan.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.17  Custodial offices.

    Forms CCC-Cotton A and CCC-Cotton A-1, collateral warehouse receipts 
and related documents will be maintained in the custody of CCC, the 
county office, the loan servicing agent, or the

[[Page 369]]

servicing agent bank, whichever disbursed the loan evidenced by such 
documents.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.18  Liability of the producer.

    (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in 
obtaining a loan or loan deficiency payment or in maintaining or 
settling a loan, or disposes of or moves the loan collateral without the 
prior written approval of CCC, such loan or loan deficiency payment 
shall be payable upon demand by CCC. The producer shall be liable for:
    (i) The amount of the loan or loan deficiency payment;
    (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC with respect to the loan or 
loan deficiency payment;
    (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts;
    (v) Liquidated damages in accordance with paragraph (e); and
    (vi) With regard to amounts due for a loan, the payment of such 
amounts may not be satisfied by the forfeiture of loan collateral to CCC 
of cotton with a settlement value that is less than the total of such 
amounts or by repayment of such loan at the lower loan repayment rate as 
prescribed in Sec. 1427.19.
    (2) Notwithstanding any provision of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent representation or 
if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without 
prior written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral delivered 
to or acquired by CCC shall be equal to the sales price of the cotton 
less any costs incurred by CCC in completing the sale.
    (b) If the amount disbursed under a loan, or in settlement thereof, 
or loan deficiency payment exceeds the amount authorized by this 
subpart, the producer shall be liable for repayment of such excess, plus 
interest. In addition, the commodity pledged as collateral for such loan 
shall not be released to the producer until such excess is repaid.
    (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan or loan deficiency payment is less than the amount required in 
accordance with this subpart, the producer shall be personally liable 
for repayment of the amount of such deficiency plus applicable interest.
    (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
or loan deficiency payment application with CCC, each such producer 
shall be jointly and severally liable for the violation of the terms and 
conditions of the note and security agreement or loan deficiency payment 
application and the regulations set forth in this subpart. Each such 
producer shall also remain liable for repayment of the entire loan or 
loan deficiency payment amount until the loan is fully repaid without 
regard to such producer's claimed share in the cotton pledged as 
collateral for the loan or for which the loan deficiency payment was 
made. In addition, such producer may not amend the note and security 
agreement or loan deficiency payment application with respect to the 
producer's claimed share in such cotton after execution of the note and 
security agreement or loan deficiency payment application by CCC.
    (e) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC if a producer makes 
any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or loan deficiency 
payment or in maintaining or settling a loan or disposing of or moving 
the loan collateral without the prior written approval of CCC. 
Accordingly, if CCC determines that the producer has violated the terms 
or conditions of Form CCC-Cotton A, Form CCC-Cotton AA, or Form CCC-709, 
as applicable, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of 
the cotton which is involved in the violation. If CCC determines the 
producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the first offense; or

[[Page 370]]

    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the 
loan deficiency payment rate for the second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for 
cases other than first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the loan 
deficiency payment rate.
    (f) For first and second offenses, if CCC determines that a producer 
acted in good faith when the violation occurred, CCC shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal and charges, plus 
interest applicable to the loan quantity affected by the violation or 
for loan deficiency payment, the loan deficiency payment amount 
applicable to the loan deficiency quantity involved with the violation, 
and charges plus interest from the date the loan deficiency payment was 
made; and
    (2) Assess liquidated damages in accordance with paragraph (e);
    (3) If the producer fails to pay such amounts within 30 calendar 
days from the date of notification, CCC shall call the applicable loan 
involved in the violation and require repayment of any market gain 
previously realized for the applicable loan, plus any interest 
previously waived and any storage paid by CCC, or for loan deficiency 
payment, require repayment of the loan deficiency payment and charges 
plus interest from the date the loan deficiency payment was made.
    (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense 
for which CCC cannot determine good faith when the violation occurred, 
CCC shall:
    (1) Assess liquidated damages in accordance with paragraph (e); and
    (2) Call the applicable loan involved in the violation and require 
repayment of any market gain previously realized for the applicable 
loan, plus any interest previously waived and any storage paid by CCC, 
and with respect to a loan deficiency payment, require repayment of the 
loan deficiency payment and charges plus interest from the date the loan 
deficiency payment was made.
    (h) If the county committee acting on behalf of CCC determines that 
the producer has committed a violation in accordance with paragraph (e), 
the county committee shall notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information regarding the circumstances which caused the violation, to 
the county committee; and
    (2) Administrative actions will be taken in accordance with 
paragraph (f) or (g).
    (i) If the loan is called in accordance with this section, the 
producer must repay the loan at principal and charges, plus interest and 
may not repay the loan at the lower of the loan repayment rate in 
accordance with Sec. 1427.19 or utilize the provisions of part 1401 of 
this chapter with respect to such loan.
    (j) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (e) may be waived as determined by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.19  Repayment of loans.

    (a) Warehouse receipts will not be released except as provided in 
this section.
    (b) A producer or agent or subsequent agent authorized on Form CCC-
605 may redeem one or more bales of cotton pledged as collateral for a 
loan by payment to CCC of an amount applicable to the bales of cotton 
being redeemed determined in accordance with this section. CCC, upon 
proper payment for the amount due, shall release the warehouse receipts 
applicable to such cotton.
    (c) A producer or agent or subsequent agent authorized on Form CCC-
605, may repay the loan amount for one or more bales of cotton pledged 
as collateral for a loan:
    (1) For upland cotton, at a level that is the lesser of:
    (i) The loan level and charges, plus interest determined for such 
bales; or
    (ii) The adjusted world price, as determined by CCC in accordance 
with Sec. 1427.25, in effect on the day the repayment is received by the 
county office, loan servicing agent, or servicing agent bank that 
disbursed the loan.
    (2) For ELS cotton, by repaying the loan amount and charges, plus 
interest determined for such bales.

[[Page 371]]

    (d) CCC shall determine and publicly announce the adjusted world 
price for each crop of upland cotton on a weekly basis.
    (e) The difference between the loan level, excluding charges and 
interest, and the loan repayment level is the market gain. The total 
amount of any market gain realized by a person is subject to part 1400 
of this chapter.
    (f) Repayment of loans will not be accepted after CCC acquires title 
to the cotton in accordance with Sec. 1427.7.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, CCC will 
not accept repayment of upland cotton at a rate based on the adjusted

period has been made in accordance with Sec. 1427.25(e).
    (h) If the upland cotton pledged as collateral is eligible to be 
repaid at a rate less than the loan level and charges, plus interest, 
and the adjusted world price determined in accordance with Sec. 1427.25 
is:
    (1) Below the national average loan rate for upland cotton, CCC will 
pay at the time of loan repayment to the producer or agent or subsequent 
agent authorized on Form CCC-605 the warehouse storage charges which 
have accrued, with respect to the cotton pledged as collateral for such 
loan, during the period the cotton was pledged for loan;
    (2) Above the national average loan rate by less than the sum of the 
accrued interest and warehouse storage charges, that accrued during the 
period the cotton was pledged for loan, CCC will pay at the time of loan 
repayment to the producer or agent or subsequent agent authorized on 
Form CCC-605 that portion of the warehouse storage charges, that accrued 
during the period the cotton was pledged for loan, that are determined 
to be necessary to permit the loan to be repaid at the adjusted world 
price without regard to any warehouse charges that accrued before the 
cotton was pledged for loan; or
    (3) Above the national average loan rate by as much as or more than 
the sum of the accrued interest and warehouse storage charges that 
accrued during the period the cotton was pledged for loan, CCC shall not 
pay any of the accrued warehouse storage charges.

Sec. 1427.23  Cotton loan deficiency payments.

    (a) Producers may obtain loan deficiency payments for 1996 through 
2002 crops of upland cotton in accordance with this section.
    (b) In order to be eligible to receive such loan deficiency 
payments, the producer of the upland cotton must:
    (1) Comply with all of the upland cotton loan eligibility 
requirements in accordance with this subpart;
    (2) Agree to forgo obtaining such loans;
    (3) File a request for payment for a quantity of eligible cotton in 
accordance with Sec. 1427.5(a) on Form CCC-Cotton AA, Form CCC-709, or

    (6) Otherwise comply with all program requirements.
    (c) The loan deficiency payment applicable to a crop of cotton shall 
be computed by multiplying the applicable loan deficiency payment rate, 
as determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, by the 
quantity of the crop the producer is eligible to pledge as collateral 
for a loan.
    (d) The loan deficiency payment rate for a crop of upland cotton 
shall be the amount by which the loan rate determined for a bale of such 
crop exceeds the adjusted world price, as determined by CCC in 
accordance with Sec. 1427.25, in effect on the day the request is 
received by the county office, loan servicing agent, or servicing agent 
bank.
    (e) The total amount of any loan deficiency payments that a person 
may receive is subject to part 1400 of this chapter.
    (f) If the producer enters into an agreement with CCC on or before 
the date of ginning a quantity of eligible upland cotton, and the 
producer has the beneficial interest in such quantity as specified in 
accordance with Sec. 1427.5(c) on the date the cotton was ginned, the 
loan deficiency payment rate applicable to such cotton will be the loan 
deficiency payment rate based on the date the cotton was ginned. In such 
cases, the producer must meet all the other requirements in paragraph 
(b) on or before the final date to apply for a loan deficiency payment 
in accordance with Sec. 1427.5.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, CCC will

payment rate beginning at 4 p.m. eastern time each Thursday until an 
announcement of the adjusted world price for the succeeding weekly 
period has been made in accordance with Sec. 1427.25(e). In the event 
that Thursday is a non-workday, such applications for loan deficiency 
payments will not be accepted beginning at 7 a.m. eastern time the next 
workday until an announcement of the adjusted world price for the 
succeeding weekly period has been made in accordance with 
Sec. 1427.25(e).

Sec. 1427.24  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.25  Determination of the prevailing world market price and the adjusted world price for upland cotton.

    (a) The prevailing world market price for upland cotton shall be 
determined by CCC as follows:
    (1) During the period when only one daily price quotation is 
available for each growth quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-
second inch (M 1\3/32\ inch) cotton C.I.F. (cost, insurance, and 
freight) northern Europe, the prevailing world market price for upland 
cotton shall be based upon the average of the quotations for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the 
growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe.
    (2) During the period when both a price quotation for cotton for 
shipment no later than August/September of the current calendar year 
(current shipment price) and a price quotation for cotton for shipment 
no earlier than October/November of the current calendar year (forward 
shipment price) are available for growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton C.I.F. northern Europe, the prevailing world market price for 
upland cotton shall be based upon the following: Beginning with the 
first week

[[Page 373]]

covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes April 15 or, 
if both the average of the current shipment prices for the preceding 
Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths 
quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (Northern Europe 
current price) and the average of the forward shipment prices for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the 
growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe 
(Northern Europe forward price) are not available during that period, 
beginning with the first week covering the period Friday through 
Thursday after the week which includes April 15 in which both the 
Northern Europe current price and the Northern Europe forward price are 
available, the prevailing world market price for upland cotton shall be 
based upon the result calculated by the following procedure:
    (i) Weeks 1 and 2: (2  x  Northern Europe current price) + Northern 
Europe forward price/3.
    (ii) Weeks 3 and 4: Northern Europe current price + Northern Europe 
forward price/2.
    (iii) Weeks 5 and 6: Northern Europe current price + (2  x  Northern 
Europe forward price)/3.
    (iv) Week 7 through July 31: Northern Europe forward price.
    (3) The prevailing world market price for upland cotton as 
determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this 
section shall hereinafter be referred to as the ``Northern Europe 
price.''
    (4) If quotes are not available for one or more days in the 5-day 
period, the available quotes during the period will be used. If no 
quotes are available during the Friday through Thursday period, the 
prevailing world market price shall be based upon the best available 
world price information, as determined by CCC.
    (b) The prevailing world market price for upland cotton, adjusted in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section (adjusted world price), 
shall be applicable to the 1996 through 2002 crops of upland cotton.
    (c) The adjusted world price for upland cotton shall equal the 
Northern Europe price as determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this section, adjusted as follows:
    (1) The Northern Europe price shall be adjusted to average 
designated U.S. spot market location by deducting the average difference 
in the immediately preceding 52-week period between:
    (i)(A) The average of price quotations for the U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted each Thursday 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe during the period when 
only one daily price quotation for such growths is available, or
    (B) The average of the current shipment prices for U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted each Thursday 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe during the period when 
both current shipment prices and forward shipment prices for such 
growths are available; and
    (ii) The average price of M 1\3/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 
and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 24 through 25 grams per tex) cotton as 
quoted each Thursday in the designated U.S. spot markets.
    (2) The price determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section shall be adjusted to reflect the price of Strict Low Middling 
(SLM) 1\1/16\ inch (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, 
strength 24 through 25 grams per tex) cotton (U.S. base quality) by 
deducting the difference, as announced by CCC, between the applicable 
loan rate for a crop of upland cotton for M 1\3/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 
through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 24 through 25 grams per tex) 
cotton and the loan rate for a crop of upland cotton of the U.S. base 
quality.
    (3) The price determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) shall 
be adjusted to average U.S. location by deducting the difference between 
the average loan rate for a crop of upland cotton of the U.S. base 
quality in the designated U.S. spot markets and the corresponding crop 
year national average loan rate for a crop of upland cotton of the U.S. 
base quality, as announced by CCC.
    (4)(i) The prevailing world market price, as adjusted in accordance 
with paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3), may be

[[Page 374]]

further adjusted if it is determined that:
    (A) Such price is less than 115 percent of the current crop-year 
loan level for U.S. base quality cotton, and
    (B) The Friday through Thursday average price quotation for the 
lowest-priced United States growth as quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton 
C.I.F. northern Europe (U.S. Northern Europe price) is greater than the 
average of the quotations for the preceding Friday through Thursday for 
the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton C.I.F. northern Europe.
    (ii) During the period when both current shipment prices and forward 
shipment prices are available for growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch 
cotton C.I.F. northern Europe, the U.S. Northern Europe price provided 
in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) shall be determined as follows: Beginning with 
the week covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes 
April 15 or, if both the average of the current shipment prices for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday of the lowest-priced United States 
growth as quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (U.S. 
Northern Europe current price) and the average of the forward shipment 
prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday of the lowest-priced 
United States growth quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern 
Europe (U.S. Northern Europe forward price) are not available during 
that period, beginning with the first week covering the period Friday 
through Thursday after the week which includes April 15 in which both 
the average of the U.S. Northern Europe current price and the average of 
the U.S. Northern Europe forward price are available, the result 
calculated by the following procedure:
    (A) Weeks 1 and 2: (2 x U.S. Northern Europe current price)+(U.S. 
Northern Europe forward price) /3.
    (B) Weeks 3 and 4: (U.S. Northern Europe current price)+(U.S. 
Northern Europe forward price) /2.
    (C) Weeks 5 and 6: (U.S. Northern Europe current price)+(2 x U.S. 
Northern Europe forward price) /3.
    (D) Week 7 through July 31: U.S. Northern Europe forward price.
    (iii) In determining the U.S. Northern Europe price as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(B) and (c)(4)(ii):
    (A) If quotes for either the U.S. Memphis territory or the 
California/Arizona territory are not available for any week, the 
available quotations will be used.
    (B) If quotes are not available for one or more days in the 5-day 
period, the available quotes during the period will be used.
    (C) If no quotes are available for either the U.S. Memphis territory 
or the California/Arizona territory during the Friday through Thursday 
period, no adjustment will be made.
    (iv)(A) The adjustment shall be based on some or all of the 
following data, as available:
    (1) The U.S. share of world exports;
    (2) The current level of cotton export sales and shipments; and
    (3) Other data determined by CCC to be relevant in establishing an 
accurate prevailing world market price, adjusted to United States 
quality and location.
    (B) The adjustment may not exceed the difference between the U.S. 
Northern Europe price, as determined in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through 
(c)(4)(iii), and the Northern Europe price, as determined in paragraph 
(a).
    (d) In determining the average difference in the 52-week period as 
provided in paragraph (c)(1):
    (1) If the difference between the average price quotations for the 
U.S. Memphis territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted 
for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe and the average price 
of M 1\3/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, 
strength 24 through 25 grams per tex) cotton as quoted each Thursday in 
the designated U.S. spot markets for any week is:
    (i) More than 115 percent of the estimated actual cost associated 
with transporting U.S. cotton to northern Europe, then 115 percent of 
such actual cost shall be substituted in lieu thereof for such week.
    (ii) Less than 85 percent of the estimated actual cost associated 
with transporting U.S. cotton to northern Europe, then 85 percent of 
such actual

[[Page 375]]

cost shall be substituted in lieu thereof for such week.
    (2) If a Thursday price quotation for either the U.S. Memphis 
territory or the California/Arizona territory as quoted for M 1\3/32\ 
inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe is not available for any week, CCC:
    (i) May use the available northern Europe quotation to determine the 
difference between the average price quotations for the U.S. Memphis 
territory and the California/Arizona territory as quoted for M 1\3/32\ 
inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe and the average price of M 1\3/32\ 
inch (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 24 
through 25 grams per tex) cotton as quoted each Thursday in the 
designated U.S. spot markets for that week, or
    (ii) May not take that week into consideration.
    (3) If Thursday price quotations for any week are not available for 
either,
    (i) both the Memphis territory and the California/Arizona territory 
as quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe, or
    (ii) the average price of M 1\3/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 
and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 24 through 25 grams per tex) cotton as 
quoted in the designated U.S. spot markets, that week will not be taken 
into consideration.
    (e) The adjusted world price for upland cotton as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c), and the amount of the additional 
adjustment as determined in accordance with paragraph (f), shall be 
announced, to the extent practicable, at 5 p.m. eastern time each 
Thursday continuing through the last Thursday of July 2003. In the event 
that Thursday is a non-workday, the determination will be announced, to 
the extent practicable, at 8 a.m. eastern time the next workday. The 
adjusted world price and the amount of the additional adjustment will be 
effective upon announcement and will remain in effect for a period as 
announced by CCC.
    (f)(1)(i) The adjusted world price, as determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c), shall be subject to further adjustments as provided in 
this section with respect to all qualities of upland cotton eligible for 
loan except the following grades of upland cotton with a staple length 
of 1\1/16\ inch or longer:
    (A) White Grades--Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 6; 
Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 6; Strict Low Middling, leaf 1 through

2; and
    (ii) Grade and Staple length must be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 1427.9. If no such official classification is presented, the coarse 
count adjustment shall not be made.
    (2) The adjustment for upland cotton provided for by paragraph 
(f)(1) shall be determined by deducting from the adjusted world price:
    (i) The difference between the Northern Europe price, and
    (A) During the period when only one daily price quotation for each 
growth quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe is 
available the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday 
through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths 
quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe; or
    (B) During the period when both current shipment prices and forward 
shipment prices are available for the growths quoted for ``coarse 
count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe, the result calculated by the 
following procedure: Beginning with the first week covering the period 
Friday through Thursday which includes April 15 or, if both the average 
of the current shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday 
for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for ``coarse 
count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (Northern Europe coarse count 
current price) and the average of the forward shipment prices for the 
preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of 
the growths quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe 
(Northern Europe coarse count forward price) are not available during 
that period, beginning with the first week covering the

[[Page 376]]

period Friday through Thursday after the week which includes April 15 in 
which both the Northern Europe coarse count current price and the 
Northern Europe coarse count forward price are available:
    (1) Weeks 1 and 2: (2 `` x '' Northern Europe coarse count current 
price) + Northern Europe coarse count forward price/3;
    (2) Weeks 3 and 4: Northern Europe coarse count current price + 
Northern Europe coarse count forward price/2;
    (3) Weeks 5 and 6: Northern Europe coarse count current price + (2 
x  Northern Europe coarse count forward price)/3; and
    (4) Week 7 through July 31: The Northern Europe coarse count forward 
price, minus:
    (ii) The difference between the applicable loan rate for a crop of 
upland cotton for M 1\3/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 through 3.6 and 4.3 
through 4.9, strength 24 through 25 grams per tex) cotton and the loan 
rate for a crop of upland cotton for SLM 1\1/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 
through 3.6 and 4.3 through 4.9, strength 24 through 25 grams per tex) 
cotton.
    (iii) The result of the calculation as determined in accordance with 
this paragraph (f)(2) shall hereinafter be referred to as the ``Northern 
Europe coarse count price.''
    (3) With respect to the determination of the Northern Europe coarse 
count price in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(i):
    (i) If no quotes are available for one or more days of the 5-day 
period, the available quotes will be used;
    (ii) If quotes for three growths are not available for any day in 
the 5-day period, that day will not be taken into consideration; and
    (iii) If quotes for three growths are not available for at least 
three days in the 5-day period, that week will not be taken into 
consideration, in which case the adjustment determined in accordance 
with paragraph (f)(2) for the latest available week will continue to be 
applicable.
    (g) If the 6-week transition periods from using current shipment 
prices to using forward shipment prices in the determination of the 
Northern Europe price in accordance with paragraph (a)(2), and the 
Northern Europe coarse count price in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(2)(i)(B) do not begin at the same time, CCC shall use either current 
shipment prices, forward shipment prices, or any combination thereof, to 
determine the Northern Europe price and/or the Northern Europe coarse 
count price used in the determination of the adjustment for upland 
cotton provided for by paragraph (f)(1) and determined in accordance 
with paragraph (f)(2), in order to prevent distortions in such 
adjustment.
    (h) The adjusted world price, determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c), shall be subject to further adjustments, as determined by 
CCC based upon the Schedule of Premiums and Discounts and the location 
differentials applicable to each warehouse location as announced in 
accordance with the loan program for a crop of upland cotton.

    (1) The payment rate in effect when the optional origin contract was 
made, or

[[Page 385]]

    (2) The payment rate in effect on the date of the written 
notification which is submitted to CCC stating that the cotton shipped, 
or to be shipped, under such contract was, or shall be, of United States 
origin.
    (f) For the purposes of this subpart--
    (1) With respect to the determination of the U.S. Northern Europe 
price, the U.S. Northern Europe current price, the U.S. Northern Europe 
forward price, the Northern Europe price, the Northern Europe current 
price and the Northern Europe forward price--
    (i) If daily quotes are not available for one or more days of the 5-
day period, the available quotes during the period will be used.
    (ii) If no daily quotes are available for the entire 5-day period 
for either or both the U.S. Northern Europe price and the Northern 
Europe price during the period when only one daily price quotation is 
available for each growth quoted for M 1-3/32 inch cotton, delivered 
C.I.F. Northern Europe; or the U.S. Northern Europe current price and 
the Northern Europe current price; or the U.S. Northern Europe forward 
price and the Northern Europe forward price, that week will not be taken 
into consideration, in which case CCC may establish a payment rate at a 
level it determines to be appropriate, taking into consideration the 
payment rate determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section 
for the latest available week.
    (iii) Beginning July 18, 1996, if no daily quotes are available for 
the entire 5-day period for either or both the USNEc price and the NEc 
price, the marketing year transition shall be implemented immediately as 
provided for in paragraph (c)(1).
    (2) With respect to the determination of the U.S. Northern Europe 
price, the U.S. Northern Europe current price, and the U.S. Northern

or the California/Arizona territory as quoted for M 1-3/32 inch cotton, 
delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe, is not available for each or any day 
of the 5-day period, the available quote will be used.
    (g) Payment rates for loose, reginned motes and semi-processed motes 
which are of a quality suitable, without further processing, for 
spinning, papermaking or bleaching shall be based on a percentage of the 
basic rate for baled lint, as specified in the Upland Cotton Domestic 
User/Exporter Agreement.

Sec. 1427.108  Payment.

    (a) Payments in accordance with this subpart shall be determined by 
multiplying:
    (1) The payment rate, determined in accordance with Sec. 1427.107, 
by
    (2) The net weight (gross weight minus the weight of bagging and 
ties) determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, of 
eligible upland cotton bales that are opened by an eligible domestic 
user or sold for export by an eligible exporter during the Friday 
through Thursday period following a week in which a payment rate is 
established.
    (b) For the purposes of this subpart, the net weight shall be 
determined based upon:
    (1) For domestic users, the weight on which settlement for payment 
of the cotton was based (``landed mill weight'');
    (2) For reginned motes processed by an end user who converted such 
motes, without rebaling, to an end use in a continuous manufacturing 
process, the net weight of the reginned motes after final cleaning;
    (3) For exporters, the shipping warehouse weight or the gin weight 
if the cotton was not placed in a warehouse, of the eligible cotton 
unless the exporter obtains and pays the cost of having all the bales in 
the shipment reweighed by a licensed weigher and furnishes a copy of the 
certified reweights.
    (c) For the purposes of this subpart, eligible upland cotton will be 
considered--
    (1) Purchased by the domestic user on the date the bale is opened in 
preparation for consumption; and
    (2) From August 1, 1991, through July 17, 1996, sold by the exporter 
on the date the contract for sale is confirmed in writing and which is 
contracted for

[[Page 386]]

delivery by not later than September 30, 1996; and
    (3) Excluding cotton covered under paragraph (c)(2), through July 
31, 2003, exported by the exporter on the date that CCC determines is 
the date on which the cotton is shipped.
    (d) Payments in accordance with this subpart shall be made available 
upon application for payment and submission of supporting documentation, 
including proof of purchases and consumption of eligible cotton by the 
domestic user or proof of export of eligible cotton by the exporter, as 
required by the provisions of the Upland Cotton Domestic User/Exporter 
Agreement issued by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.109  Contract cancellations.

    (a) For the purposes of this subpart, except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section, any contract entered into by an exporter 
that is canceled or amended to reduce the contract quantity shall be 
replaced by the exporter with a subsequent contract (``replacement 
contract'') designated by the exporter at the time a copy of the 
replacement contract is submitted to CCC, as specified in the Upland 
Cotton Domestic User/Exporter Agreement (``the Agreement''). Optional 
origin export contracts that are canceled/amended must be replaced with 
either an optional origin export contract or a contract to export United 
States cotton. The replacement contract shall specify shipment of the 
cotton by not later than September 30 following the shipment date 
specified in the original contract, except if the cancellation/amendment 
of a contract that specified shipment by not later than September 30 
occurs after September 1, the replacement contract shall be entered into 
within 30 days after the cancellation/amendment and shipment shall be 
completed within 30 days after the replacement contract is entered into, 
but in no event may shipment be completed later than December 31. The 
provisions of this paragraph shall apply to--
    (1) All undelivered (open) export contracts (including optional 
origin export contracts) outstanding as of the later of the date the 
Agreement was executed by the exporter or August 29, 1991;
    (2) Any export contracts that were canceled, or amended to reduce 
the contract quantity, between the later of June 18, 1991, or 75 days 
prior to the date the Agreement was executed by the exporter and the 
later of the date the Agreement was executed by the exporter or August 
29, 1991, which are not replaced by the later of the date the Agreement 
was executed by the exporter or August 29, 1991; and
    (3) All new export contracts entered into by the exporter on or 
after August 30, 1991, and prior to July 18, 1996 which are for delivery 
by not later than September 30, 1996.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 1427.107, the payment 
rate for a replacement contract shall be the lesser of the payment rate 
in effect on the date of the original contract or the payment rate in 
effect on the date of the replacement contract.
    (c) If shipment of the cotton on any replacement contract is--
    (1) Completed by October 31, the payment rate shall be the payment 
rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) Not completed by October 31, the payment rate shall be zero;
    (3) Not completed, or a replacement contract is not designated by 
the exporter by December 31, the exporter shall pay liquidated damages 
to CCC in an amount determined by multiplying the quantity of cotton not 
shipped by the higher of:
    (i) The difference between the highest payment rate paid to, or 
earned by, the exporter between the date the original contract was 
entered into and December 31 of the year in which the original contract 
shipment period ends, regardless of whether the highest payment rate 
paid to, or earned by, the exporter was a current or forward-crop 
payment rate, and the payment rate determined in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section, or
    (ii) 50 percent of the original contract payment rate.

[[Page 387]]

    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of 
this section, with respect to optional origin export contracts, shipment 
of foreign cotton will fulfill the shipment requirements but such cotton 
will be ineligible for payments.
    (e) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section 
will not apply if CCC determines, based upon written evidence provided 
by the exporter, that a contract cancellation, amendment, or failure to 
export is due to reasons beyond the control of the exporter. If, as 
determined by CCC, the cancellation is beyond the control of the 
exporter, replacement contracts are not required, and the assessment of 
liquidated damages by CCC is waived. Documentation to support that 
contract cancellations are beyond the control of the exporter must be 
submitted to CCC. Requests for relief from naming a replacement contract 
will be examined by CCC on a case-by-case basis to determine if relief 
is warranted.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.160  Applicability.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart are applicable to the 1996 
through 2002 crops of upland and extra long staple seed cotton. These 
regulations set forth the terms and conditions under which recourse seed 
cotton loans shall be made available by the Commodity Credit Corporation 
(``CCC''). Such loans will be available through March 31 of the year 
following the calendar year in which such crop is normally harvested. 
CCC may change the loan availability period to conform to State or 
locally imposed quarantines. Additional terms and conditions are set 
forth in the note and security agreement which must be executed by a 
producer in order to receive such loans.
    (b) Loan rates and the forms which are used in administering the 
recourse seed cotton loan program for a crop of cotton are available in 
State and county Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices (State and county 
offices, respectively). Loan rates shall be based upon the location at 
which the loan collateral is stored.
    (c) A producer must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request the 
loan at the county office which, in accordance with part 718 of this 
title, is responsible for administering programs for the farm on which 
the cotton was produced. A CMA must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, 
request the loan at a central county office designated by the State 
committee. All note and security agreements and related documents 
necessary for the administration of the recourse seed cotton loan 
program shall be prescribed by CCC and shall be available at State and 
county offices.
    (d) Loans shall not be available for seed cotton produced on land 
owned or otherwise in the possession of the United States if such land 
is occupied without the consent of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.161  Administration.

    (a) The recourse seed cotton loan program which is applicable to a 
crop of cotton shall be administered under the general supervision of 
the Executive Vice President, CCC (Administrator, FSA), or a designee 
and shall be carried out in the field by State and county FSA committees 
(State and county committees, respectively).
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and employees 
thereof, do not have the authority to modify or waive any of the 
provisions of the regulations of this subpart.
    (c) The State committee shall take any action required by these 
regulations which has not been taken by the county committee. The State 
committee shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, an action 
taken by such county committee which is not in accordance with the 
regulations of this subpart; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action which 
is not in accordance with the regulations of this subpart.

[[Page 388]]

    (d) No provision or delegation herein to a State or county committee 
shall preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC (Administrator, FSA), 
or a designee from determining any question arising under the recourse 
seed cotton program or from reversing or modifying any determination 
made by the State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator, FSA, may authorize State or county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines and other program requirements 
in cases where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does 
not adversely affect the operation of the recourse seed cotton loan 
program.
    (f) A representative of CCC may execute loan applications and 
related documents only under the terms and conditions determined and 
announced by CCC. Any such document which is not executed in accordance 
with such terms and conditions, including any purported execution prior 
to the date authorized by CCC, shall be null and void.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.162  Definitions.

    Section 1427.3 of this part shall be applicable to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.163  Disbursement of loans.

    (a) A producer or the producer's agent shall request a loan at the 
county office for the county which, in accordance with part 718 of this 
title, is responsible for administering programs for the farm on which 
the cotton was produced and which will assist the producer in completing 
the loan documents, except that CMA's designated by producers to obtain 
loans in their behalf may, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, obtain 
loans through a central county office designated by the State committee.
    (b) Disbursement of each loan will be made by the county office of 
the county which is responsible for administering programs for the farm 
on which the cotton was produced, except that CMA's designated by 
producers to obtain loans in their behalf may, unless otherwise 
authorized by CCC, obtain disbursement of loans at a central county 
office designated by the State committee. Service charges shall be 
deducted from the loan proceeds. The producer or the producer's agent 
shall not present the loan documents for disbursement unless the cotton 
is in existence and in good condition. If the cotton is not in existence 
and in good condition at the time of disbursement, the producer or the 
agent shall immediately return the check issued in payment of the loan 
or, if the check has been negotiated, the total amount disbursed under 
the loan, and charges plus interest shall be refunded promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.164  Eligible producer.

    (a) An eligible producer of a crop of cotton shall be a person

receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee shall be 
considered to be the production of the person or estate represented by 
the receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, or trust. Loan and loan 
deficiency payment documents executed by any such person will be 
accepted by CCC only if they are legally valid and such person has the 
authority to sign the applicable documents.

loan shall be the estimated quality of lint cotton in each lot of seed 
cotton as determined by the county office, except that if a control 
sample of the lot of cotton is classed by an Agricultural Marketing 
Service (AMS), Cotton Classing Office or other entity approved by CCC, 
the quality for the lot shall be the quality shown on the applicable 
documentation issued for the control sample.
    (c) To be eligible for loan, the beneficial interest in the seed 
cotton must be in the producer who is pledging the seed cotton as 
collateral for a loan as provided in Sec. 1427.5(c).


<R05>
Sec. 1427.166  Insurance.

    The seed cotton must be insured at the full loan value against loss 
or damage by fire.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.167  Liens.

    If there are any liens or encumbrances on the seed cotton tendered 
as collateral for a loan, waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC

from the loan proceeds. No additional liens or encumbrances shall be 
placed on the cotton after the loan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.168  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.169  Fees, charges, and interest.

    (a) A producer shall pay a nonrefundable loan service fee to CCC at 
a rate determined by CCC.
    (b) Interest which accrues with respect to a loan shall be

<R05>
Sec. 1427.170  Quantity for loan.

    (a) The quantity of lint cotton in each lot of seed cotton tendered 
for loan shall be determined by the county office by multiplying the 
weight or estimated weight of seed cotton by the lint turnout factor 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b).
    (b) The lint turnout factor for any lot of seed cotton shall be the 
percentage determined by the county committee representative during the 
initial inspection of the lot. If a control portion of the lot is 
weighed and ginned, the turnout factor determined for the portion of 
cotton ginned will be used for the lot. If a control portion is not 
weighed and ginned, the lint turnout

[[Page 390]]

factor shall not exceed 32 percent for machine-picked cotton and 22 
percent for machine-stripped cotton unless acceptable proof is furnished 
showing that the lint turnout factor is greater.
    (c) Loans shall not be made on more than a percentage established by 
the county committee of the quantity of lint cotton determined as 
provided in this section. If the seed cotton is weighed, the percentage 
to be used shall not be more than 95 percent. If the quantity is 
determined by measurement, the percentage to be used shall not be more 
than 90 percent. The percentage to be used in determining the maximum 
quantity for any loan may be reduced below such percentages by the 
county committee when determined necessary to protect the interests of 
CCC on the basis of one or more of the following risk factors:
    (1) Condition or suitability of the storage site or structure;
    (2) Condition of the cotton;
    (3) Location of the storage site or structure; and
    (4) Other factors peculiar to individual farms or producers which 
related to the preservation or safety of the loan collateral. Loans may 
be made on a lower percentage basis at the producer's request.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.171  Approved storage.

    Approved storage shall consist of storage located on or off the 
producer's farm (excluding public warehouses) which is determined by a 
county committee representative to afford adequate protection against 
loss or damage and which is located within a reasonable distance, as 
determined by CCC, from an approved gin. If the cotton is not stored on 
the producer's farm, the producer must furnish satisfactory evidence 
that the producer has the authority to store the cotton on such property 
and that the owner of such property has no lien for such storage against 
the cotton. The producer must provide satisfactory evidence that the 
producer and any person having an interest in the cotton including CCC, 
have the right to enter the premises to inspect and examine the cotton 
and shall permit a reasonable time to such persons to remove the cotton 
from the premises.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.172  Settlement.

    (a) A producer may, at any time prior to maturity of the loan, 
obtain release of all or any part of the loan seed cotton by paying to 
CCC the amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.
    (b)(1) A producer or the producer's agent shall not remove from 
storage any cotton which is pledged as collateral for a loan until prior 
written approval has been received from CCC for removal of such cotton. 
If a producer or the producer's agent obtains such approval, they may 
remove such cotton from storage, sell the seed cotton, have it ginned, 
and sell the lint cotton and cottonseed obtained therefrom. The ginner 
shall inform the county office in writing immediately after the seed 
cotton removed from storage has been ginned and furnish the county 
office the loan number, producer's name, and applicable gin bale 
numbers. If the seed cotton is removed from storage, the loan principal 
plus interest and charges thereon must be satisfied not later than the 
earlier of:
    (i) The date established by the county committee;
    (ii) 5 days after the date of the producer received the AMS 
classification in accordance with Sec. 1427.9 (and the warehouse 
receipt, if the cotton is delivered to a warehouse), representing such 
cotton; or
    (iii) The loan maturity date.
    (2) If the seed cotton or lint cotton is sold, the loan principal, 
interest, and charges must be satisfied immediately.
    (3) A producer, except a CMA, may obtain a nonrecourse loan or loan 
deficiency payment in accordance with subpart A of this part, on the 
lint cotton, but:
    (i) The loan principal, interest, and charges on the seed cotton 
must be satisfied from the proceeds of the nonrecourse loan in 
accordance with subpart A of this part; or
    (ii) The loan deficiency payment must be applied to the loan 
principal, interest, and charges on the outstanding seed cotton loan.
    (4) A CMA must repay the seed cotton loan principal, interest, and 
charges before pledging the cotton for a nonrecourse loan or before a 
loan deficiency payment can be approved in accordance with subpart A of 
this part,

[[Page 391]]

on the lint cotton. If CMA's authorized by producers to obtain loans in 
their behalf remove seed cotton from storage prior to obtaining approval 
to move such cotton, such removal shall constitute conversion of such 
cotton unless the CMA:
    (i) Notifies the county office in writing the following morning by 
mail or otherwise that such cotton has been moved and is on the gin 
yard;
    (ii) Furnishes CCC an irrevocable letter of credit if requested; and
    (iii) Repays the loan principal, plus interest and charges, within 
the time specified by the county committee.
    (5) Any removal from storage shall not be deemed to constitute a 
release of CCC's security interest in the seed cotton or to release the 
producer or CMA from liability for the loan principal, interest, and 
charges if full payment of such amount is not received by the county 
office.
    (c) If, either before or after maturity, the producer discovers that 
the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of 
condition, the producer shall immediately notify the county office and 
confirm such notice in writing. If the county committee determines that 
the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of 
condition, the county committee will call for repayment of the loan 
principal, plus interest and charges on or before a specified date. If 
the producer does not repay the loan or have the cotton ginned and 
obtain a nonrecourse loan in accordance with subpart A of this part on 
the lint cotton produced therefrom within the period as specified by the 
county committee, the cotton shall be considered abandoned.
    (d) If the producer has control of the storage site and if the 
producer subsequently loses control of the storage site or there is 
danger of flood or damage to the seed cotton or storage structure making 
continued storage of the cotton unsafe, the producer shall immediately 
either repay the loan or move the seed cotton to the nearest approved 
gin for ginning and shall, at the same time, inform the county office. 
If the producer does not do so, the seed cotton shall be considered 
abandoned.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.173  Foreclosure.

    Any seed cotton pledged as collateral for a loan which is abandoned 
or which has not been ginned and pledged as collateral for a nonrecourse 
loan in accordance with subpart A of this part by the seed cotton loan 
maturity date may be removed from storage by CCC and ginned and the 
resulting lint cotton warehoused for the account of CCC. The lint cotton 
and cottonseed may be sold, at such time, in such manner, and upon such 
terms as CCC may determine at public or private sale. CCC may become the 
purchaser of the whole or any part of such cotton and cottonseed. If the 
proceeds received from the sales of the cotton are less than the amount 
due on the loan (including principal, interest, ginning charges, and any 
other charges incurred by CCC), the producer shall be liable for such 
difference. If the proceeds received from sale of the cotton are greater 
than the sum of the amount due plus any cost incurred by CCC in 
conducting the sale of the cotton, the amount of such excess shall be 
paid to the producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of the 
producer.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.174  Maturity of seed cotton loans.

    Seed cotton loans mature on demand by CCC but no later than May 31 
following the calendar year in which such crop is normally harvested.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.175  Liability of the producer.

    (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in 
obtaining a loan, maintaining a loan, or settling a loan or if the 
producer disposes of or moves the loan collateral without the prior 
approval of CCC, such loan amount shall be refunded upon demand by CCC. 
The producer shall be liable for:
    (i) The amount of the loan;
    (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC with respect to the loan;
    (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the 
fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of 
the loan collateral;
    (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts; and
    (v) Liquidated damages in accordance with paragraph (e).

[[Page 392]]

    (2) Notwithstanding any provision of the note and security 
agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent representation or 
if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without 
prior written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral acquired 
by CCC shall be equal to the sales price of the cotton less any costs 
incurred by CCC in completing the sale.
    (b) If the amount disbursed under a loan, or in settlement thereof, 
exceeds the amount authorized by this subpart, the producer shall be 
liable for repayment of such excess, plus interest. In addition, seed 
cotton pledged as collateral for such loan shall not be released to the 
producer until such excess is repaid.
    (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the 
loan is less than the amount required in accordance with this subpart, 
the producer shall be personally liable for repayment of the amount of 
such deficiency plus applicable interest.
    (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement 
with CCC, each such producer shall be jointly and severally liable for 
the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security 
agreement and the regulations set forth in this subpart. Each such 
producer shall also remain liable for repayment of the entire loan 
amount until the loan is fully repaid without regard to such producer's 
claimed share in the seed cotton pledged as collateral for the loan. In 
addition, such producer may not amend the note and security agreement 
with respect to the producer's claimed share in such seed cotton, after 
execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.
    (e) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC if a producer makes 
any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or in maintaining or 
settling a loan or disposing of or moving the collateral without the 
prior approval of CCC. Accordingly, if CCC or the county committee 
determines that the producer has violated the terms or conditions of the 
note and security agreement, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the 
quantity of the seed cotton which is involved in the violation. If CCC 
or the county committee determines the producer:
    (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated 
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the 
violation by:
    (i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
first offense;
    (ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the 
second offense; or
    (2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for 
cases other than first or second offense, liquidated damages will be 
assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 
percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note.
    (f) For first and second offenses, if CCC or the county committee 
determines that a producer acted in good faith when the violation 
occurred, the county committee shall:
    (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan 
quantity affected by the violation, and charges plus interest applicable 
to the amount repaid;
    (2) Assess liquidated damages in accordance with paragraph (e); and
    (3) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days 
from the date of notification, call the applicable loan involved in the 
violation.
    (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense 
for which CCC or the county committee cannot determine good faith when 
the violation occurred, the county committee shall:
    (1) Assess liquidated damages in accordance with paragraph (e);
    (2) Call the applicable loan involved in the violation.
    (h) If CCC or the county committee determines that the producer has 
committed a violation in accordance with paragraph (e), the county 
committee shall notify the producer in writing that:
    (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and 
information to the county committee regarding the circumstances which 
caused the violation, and

[[Page 393]]

    (2) Administrative actions will be taken in accordance with 
paragraphs (f) or (g).
    (i) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed in accordance with 
the provision of paragraph (e) may be waived as determined by CCC.

 Subpart E--Standards for Approval of Warehouses for Cotton and Cotton 
                                 Linters

    Authority: Secs. 4 and 5, 62 Stat. 1070, as amended, 1072, as 
amended (15 U.S.C. 714 b and c).

    Source: 44 FR 67085, Nov. 23, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1081  General statement and administration.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and 
the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United 
States or Puerto Rico who desires the approval by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ``CCC'') of warehouse(s) for the 
storage and handling of cotton and cotton linters, under a Cotton 
Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or held by CCC as security for 
price support loans. This subpart is not applicable to cotton or cotton 
linters purchased in storage for prompt shipment or to handling 
operations of a temporary nature.
    (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for 
obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas 
City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 205, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the ``KCCO'').
    (c) A warehouse must be approved by the KCCO and a storage agreement 
must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC will use 
such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering into of a 
storage agreement does not constitute a commitment that CCC will use the 
warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.
    (d) A warehouseman, when applying for approval under this subpart 
shall submit to CCC at KCCO:
    (1) A completed Form CCC-49, ``Application for Approval of Warehouse 
for Storage of Cotton and/or Cotton Linters,''
    (2) A current financial statement on Form WA-51, ``Financial 
Statement'', supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may 
request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than Form 
WA-51 with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee. 
Financial statements shall show the financial condition of the 
warehouseman as of a date no earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the 
date of the warehouseman's application, or such other date as CCC may 
prescribe. Additional financial statements shall be furnished annually 
and at such other times as CCC may require. CCC also may require that 
financial statements prepared by the warehouseman or by a public 
accountant be examined by an independent certified public accountant in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Only one 
financial statement is required for a chain of warehouses owned or 
operated by a single business entity. If approved by the Director, KCCO, 
or the Director's designee, the financial statement of a parent company, 
which includes the financial position of a wholly-owned subsidiary, may 
be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for the wholly-owned 
subsidiary.
    (3) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate 
licensing authority as required under Sec. 1427.1082(a)(2) and such 
other documents or information as CCC may require,
    (4) For warehouseman not operating under the U.S. Warehouse Act, a 
sample copy of the warehouseman's receipts and bale tags, and
    (5) Evidence of applicable fire insurance rates.

Sec. 1427.1082  Basic standards.

    Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, each warehouseman and 
each of the warehouses owned or operated by such warehouseman for which 
CCC approval is sought for the storage or

[[Page 394]]

handling of CCC-owned or -loan commodities shall meet the following 
standards:
    (a) The warehouseman shall:
    (1) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for 
hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a

    (3) Have a net worth which is the greater of $25,000 or the amount 
which results from multiplying the maximum storage capacity of the 
warehouse (the total number of bales of cotton or cotton linters which 
the warehouse can accommodate when stored in the customary manner) times 
ten (10) dollars per bale. The net worth need not exceed $250,000. If 
the calculated net worth exceeds $25,000, the warehouseman may satisfy 
any deficiency in net worth between the $25,000 minimum requirement and 
such calculated net worth by furnishing bond (or acceptable substitute 
security) meeting the requirements of Sec. 1427.1083,
    (4) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating 
expenses,
    (5) Have satisfactorily corrected, upon request by CCC, any 
deficiencies in the performance of any storage agreement with CCC,
    (6) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,
    (7) Use only card type warehouse receipts which are pre-numbered and 
pre-punched or such other document as CCC may prescribe,
    (8) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable 
firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored 
commodity, and
    (9) Have a work force and equipment available to provide adequate 
storage and handling service.
    (b) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operation shall have the 
necessary experience, organization, technical qualifications, and skills 
in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodities to 
enable them to provide proper storage and handling services.
    (c) Warehouseman, officials and each of the supervisory employees of 
the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operation shall:
    (1) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and 
performance, and
    (2) Be neither suspended nor debarred under applicable CCC 
suspension and debarment regulations.
    (d) The warehouse shall:
    (1) Be of sound construction, in good state of repair, and 
adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the 
applicable commodity,
    (2) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all 
times, and
    (3) Not be subject to greater than normal risk of fire, flood, or 
other hazards.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1083  Bonding requirements for net worth.

    A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) Such bond shall be executed by a surety which:
    (1) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and
    (2) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept 
service of legal process and in the State where the warehouse is 
located.
    (b) Such bond shall be on Form CCC-33, ``Warehouseman's Bond'', 
except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under 
operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be 
accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running 
directly to CCC if:
    (1) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to 
CCC.
    (2) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a 
surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement 
being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and

[[Page 395]]

    (3) It is noncancellable for not less than ninety (90) days or 
includes a rider providing for not less than ninety (90) days' notice to 
CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a substitute bond for one 
warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC against insufficient 
bond coverage on other warehouses.
    (c) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be 
accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond 
coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be 
returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was 
required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the 
storage agreement.
    (d) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in 
lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy 
contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC 
determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves 
it for legal sufficiency.
    (e) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu 
of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank 
is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such standby letter of credit shall be on Form CCC-33A, 
``Irrevocable Letter of Credit'', or on such other form as may be 
specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

26, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1084  Examination of warehouses.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a warehouse must be 
examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC 
for the storage and handling of the commodity and periodically 
thereafter to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1085  Exceptions.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this report:
    (a) The financial bond and original and periodic warehouse 
examination provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman 
approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of cotton 
or cotton linters under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under 
the U.S. Warehouse Act for such commodity but a special examination 
shall be made of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is 
necessary.
    (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $25,000 but who 
fails, or whose warehouse fails, to meet one or more of the other 
standards of this subpart may be approved if:
    (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the 
warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory 
protection for the commodity,
    (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or 
cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance 
policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

[44 FR 67085, Nov. 23, 1979, as amended by Amdt. 3, 50 FR 16455, Apr. 
26, 1985; 56 FR 11502, Mar. 19, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1086  Approval of warehouse, requests for reconsideration.

    (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse 
meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of 
approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does 
not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the 
warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other 
agency of the United States.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:
    (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the 
warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart, and
    (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the 
warehouseman. This notice will state the cause(s) for such action. 
Unless the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the 
warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse 
if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of 
approval have been remedied.

[[Page 396]]

    (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's 
failure to meet the standards set forth:
    (1) In Sec. 1427.1082, other than the standard set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) thereof, the warehouseman may, at any time after 
receiving notice of such action, request reconsideration of the action 
and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of 
such request. The Director shall consider such information in making a 
determination of notify the warehouseman in writing of such 
determination. The warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's 
determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal 
hearing thereon by filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency (hereinafter referred to as 
``FSA''). The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, 
nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the 
hearing shall be as prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 
7 CFR part 780. When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman 
shall be considered as a ``participant''; and
    (2) In Sec. 1427.1082(c)(2), the warehouseman's administrative 
appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in 
accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period 
of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for 
approval under this subpart.

[Amdt. 3, 50 FR 16455, Apr. 26, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 1427.1087  Exemption from requirements.

    (a) If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the 
provisions of this subpart and no reasonable and economical alternative 
is available for securing such services for commodities under CCC 
programs, the President or Executive Vice President, CCC may exempt, in 
writing, applicants in such area from one or more of the standards of 
this subpart and may establish such other standards as are considered 
necessary to safeguard satisfactorily the interests of CCC.
    (b) Warehousemen who are currently under contract with CCC will be 
required to meet the terms and conditions of these regulations at the 
time of renewal of their contract.

<R05>
Sec. 1427.1088  Contract fees.

    (a) Each warehouseman who has a non-federally licensed cotton 
warehouse must pay an annual contract fee for each such warehouse for 
which the warehouseman requests renewal of an existing Cotton Storage 
Agreement or approval of a new Cotton Storage Agreement as follows:
    (1) A warehouseman who has an existing Cotton Storage Agreement with 
CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or cotton pledged 
to CCC as loan collateral must pay an annual contract fee for each 
warehouse approved under such agreement in advance of the renewal date 
of such agreement.
    (2) A warehouseman who does not have an existing Cotton Storage 
Agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or 
cotton pledged to CCC as loan collateral but who desires such an 
agreement must pay a contract fee for each warehouse for which CCC 
approval is sought prior to the time that the agreement is approved by 
CCC.
    (b) The amount of the contract fee shall be determined and announced 
annually in the Federal Register.

of milk individually by such person and each of the persons who are 
related persons with respect to that person were not greater than the 
marketings of milk by those persons for the preceding year.
    (d) Applicability. The provisions of this subpart shall apply to all

Sec. 1430.344  Refunds--General provisions for eligibility and other requirements.

    (a) A refund of a reduction in producer proceeds made under this 
subpart may be made only to the extent explicitly provided for in this 
subpart. Such refunds may be made only for milk

[[Page 402]]

marketed by producers in the calendar years 1991 through 1997. The 
monies that may be refunded to a person shall include only the 
reductions in proceeds of that person as provided for in 
Sec. 1430.343(a) pursuant to provisions of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1993.
    (b) A person may receive a refund only for reductions actually made 
in that person's producer proceeds for milk and only for those monies 
actually remitted to CCC.
    (c) If other conditions are met, a person may receive a refund of 
the entire refundable reduction made under this subpart for a calendar 
year in that person's milk producer proceeds if for that year the 
marketings of milk for commercial use, individually, of that person and 
each related person with respect to that person were not greater than 
their marketings of milk for commercial use in the applicable base 
period. This calculation will be made separately for the person seeking 
the refund and each related person.
    (d) The person seeking the refund shall be responsible to prove that 
the refund is due. Such person must present all relevant data needed by 
the county committee to establish eligibility for the payment or 
requested by the County Committee for that purpose. That information 
will include all information needed to make the necessary determinations 
concerning related persons. The person seeking the refund for all 
relevant months must present month-by-month marketing data for that 
person and related persons for the relevant time periods.
    (e) If the person seeking the refund was a responsible person for 
such person's own milk production, then such person must also provide 
proof that the required remittances were paid to CCC. If the responsible 
person was a third party, the person seeking the refund shall be 
required to certify whether, to the best of such person's knowledge, the 
reductions to be refunded were remitted to the CCC. If the third party 
did not make full payment for all marketings of all producers for the 
relevant period, the refund eligibility of individual producer shall be 
adjusted in such manner as DASCO determines to be appropriate taking 
into consideration the purposes of this subpart.
    (f) The burden of proof on all refund matters shall lie with the 
person seeking to obtain, or retain, a refund from CCC. Such persons may 
be required to obtain certifications and documentation as needed from 
third parties to establish eligibility for a refund.
    (g) A person may seek a refund as a representative of a producer 
where such representation arises by reason of the death, disappearance 
or incompetency of the producer or by other cause as permitted by DASCO.
    (h) No persons may apply for a refund before the end of the year of 
the reduction to be refunded.
    (i) A complete application for a refund with all necessary 
documentation must be submitted to the county committee by March 15 of 
the year following the year for which the refund is requested, or if 
March 15 is not a business day, the next business day thereafter.
    (j) If an overpayment of a refund is made, such overpayment shall be 
repaid to CCC with interest from the date of the overpayment. The 
repayment shall be due from the person who obtained the overpayment and 
any person who knowingly participated in a scheme or device to obtain 
the overpayment. If the overpayment resulted from a failure to comply 
with the provisions of this subpart, or results from a violation of this 
subpart, the persons responsible shall, in addition, be liable for a 
civil penalty to be paid to CCC. The amount of the penalty may be up to 
the amount equal to the quantity of milk involved in the overpayment 
multiplied by the support price for milk at the time the reduction in 
proceeds was made. These liabilities shall be in addition to any others 
imposed by law.
    (k) All determinations made by county committee with respect to the 
granting of refunds or collection of overpayments shall be subject to 
review by DASCO, as deemed needed by DASCO to assure uniformity of 
treatment and to assure that there is full compliance with the 
provisions of this subpart.

    (c) DASCO may consider a person to be in compliance with the 
requirements for the refund despite a failure to comply with conditions 
otherwise required by this subpart if such relief is deemed to be needed 
to afford fair and equitable treatment and the granting of such relief 
will not impair the accomplishment of the goals of the program.

for purposes of calculating refund eligibility shall be as follows:
    (i) The spouse and minor child of such person and/or guardian of

family member, the milk marketing history of the acquiring producer may 
be increased by the milk marketing history of the family member. The 
preceding sentence shall apply only if the transferor no longer has any 
interest in any dairy, dairy herd, or in any dairy production. No other 
transfer of a milk marketing history shall be permitted.
    (b) A request for a transfer of the milk marketing history must be 
made to the county committee of the county where the acquiring 
producer's dairy farm is located. A transfer may be approved only if

the transferor to claim a refund of a reduction in producer proceeds 
made under this subpart.

[[Page 404]]

    (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, if a milk 
marketing history is transferred:
    (1) The transferor shall not be eligible for a refund of a reduction 
in producer proceeds made in the year of the transfer.
    (2) The marketing of milk in the year of the transfer which could be 
attributed to the transferor shall be considered solely to be marketings 
by the transferee for calculations relating to refunds of reductions 
made in the transfer year or in the following year; and
    (3) The transferee, to the extent that other conditions are met, may 
claim refunds of reduction made in the proceeds of the transferor for 
the transfer year.

such person must immediately notify the CCC of the error and make any 
payment to the CCC that is due the CCC, together with any late-payment 
interest and other charges as are provided for in this subpart. If the 
error is otherwise unknown to the person involved until notice is given 
by the CCC, the underpayment plus late-payment interest and other 
charges provided for in this subpart shall be made by the next date for 
remitting reductions as provided in Sec. 1430.343 or within the time 
specified by the CCC if no subsequent remittances are required by this

to remit to the CCC the funds required to be collected and remitted by 
this subpart, or fails to comply with any other requirement or provision 
of this subpart. Such penalty shall be in addition to any other amount 
due CCC and in addition to any other liability imposed by law. The 
amount of the penalty shall be up to an amount which is equal to the 
support price for milk in effect at the time the failure occurs 
multiplied by the quantity of milk involved. The Vice President, CCC, or 
a designee, may assess a penalty at less than the maximum amount where

or has the effect of defeating, the implementation of, or purposes of, 
the provisions of this subpart, or the program provided for in this 
subpart, or who makes any fraudulent representation or misrepresents any 
fact affecting a determination under this subpart, shall be considered 
to have knowingly violated the provisions of this subpart and shall be

subject the person involved to penalties at the rate provided for in 
this subpart, and such acts include, but are not limited to, concealing 
from the county committee any information having a bearing on the 
application of the rules of this part, submitting false information to 
the county committee, transferring dairy cows to another dairy operation

imposed in accordance with this subpart or any other provision of law.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.358  Continuing obligations.

subpart that relate to the collection of the reductions required by this 
subpart shall be able to obtain further consideration of such 
determination by filing a request for reconsideration with the Director 
of the Dairy Division within 30 days of the date of notice of the 
determination. If, upon reconsideration by the Director, the responsible 
person is dissatisfied with the new determination, such person may 
obtain a review of such determination and an informal hearing by filing 
an appeal with the Vice President, CCC. Such appeal must be filed within 
15 days of the date of the redetermination by the Director. Such appeals 
to the Vice President, CCC, will, to the extent practicable, be 
conducted in the same manner as administrative appeals which are 
conducted under 7 CFR part 780. The decision on such appeal shall 
constitute the final agency action in the matter.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, no assessment 
shall be collected for milk marketed after April 30, 1996. Amounts 
collected for 1996 marketings shall be refundable as otherwise provided 
for in this subpart so long as, determined pursuant to this subpart, the 
producer's total milk marketings for calendar year 1996 were equal to or 
less than the producer's total marketings for calendar year 1995.
    (b) For purposes of applying the provisions of this subpart:
    (1)(i) No adjustment shall be made for milk marketings in a leap 
year, but rather comparisons between the refund and base period milk 
marketings shall be made on a calendar year basis.
    (ii) If a producer quits marketing milk from a dairy operation 
during the refund period, the comparison of marketings with the 
preceding year shall be made by comparing the marketings of the months 
and days of production in the refund period with the corresponding 
months and days of the base period, subject, in addition, to the 
provisions in paragraph (a).
    (2)(i) A producer under this subpart may be deemed to include the 
combination of all persons or entities with an interest in the 
production of milk on a farm or dairy operation.
    (ii) The addition or removal of an individual or entity, who adds to 
or removes from existing dairy units any dairy cows, to or from those 
with an interest in a dairy operation, shall constitute the formation of 
a new producer and shall be deemed to end the production history on that 
farm or dairy operation of the previous producer.
    (3) All delegations to persons or agencies contained in this subpart 
shall be deemed, as appropriate, to be made to the successor official or 
agency resulting from any reorganization made pursuant to Public Law 
103-354.

the loan making office to remove a specified quantity of the loan 
collateral from storage for the purpose of delivering it to a buyer 
before repayment of the loan by executing a Marketing Authorization for 
Loan Collateral (Form CCC-681-1).
    (2) The loan making office will approve such a request when the 
buyer of eligible dairy products agrees to pay CCC an amount necessary 
to satisfy the processor's loan indebtedness regarding the dairy

charges incurred by the CCC.
    (g) If CCC determines that the actual eligible quantity serving as 
collateral for a recourse loan is less than the loan quantity because of 
incorrect certification, unauthorized removal, or unauthorized 
disposition, CCC may call all loans of the processor. Such determination 
shall result in the processor being deemed ineligible for loans for at 
least the remainder of the fiscal year.
    (h) The security interests obtained by the CCC as a result of the 
execution of a security agreement by an eligible processor shall be 
superior to all statutory and common law liens on the collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 1430.409  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) CCC will not require the processor to insure the eligible dairy 
product pledged as collateral. However, if the processor insures such 
eligible dairy product and an indemnity is paid thereon, such indemnity 
shall accrue to the benefit of CCC to the extent of CCC's interest in 
the eligible dairy product involved in the loss.
    (b) The regulations the Secretary issues governing offsets and 
withholding set forth at part 3 of this title and part 1403 of this 
chapter are applicable to the program set forth in this subpart.
    (c) A processor may obtain reconsideration and review of 
determinations made under this subpart in accordance with the 
regulations of part 780 of this title.

written data as the examining agency deems necessary to verify 
compliance with the requirements of this subpart. Such books, records, 
accounts, and other written data shall be retained by the processor for 
not less than 3 years from the loan disbursement date.
    (e) Any false certification made for the purpose of enabling a 
processor to obtain or retain a recourse loan to

certification to liability under applicable federal civil and criminal 
statutes.

    The CCC forms used in connection with the dairy recourse loan 
program will be available from the appropriate State committee or

mean ``processor'' and the term ``crop year'' shall be deemed to mean 
``fiscal year''.

<R05>
Sec. 1435.1  Applicability.

    These regulations set forth the terms and conditions under which 
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) will make loans and enter agreements 
with eligible processors for the 1996-2002 crop years. Additional terms 
and conditions are set forth in the loan application and the note and 
security agreement which the processor must execute in order to receive 
a loan. These regulations stipulate the requirements for making sugar 
marketing assessment payments to CCC for fiscal years 1996 through 2003 
and the information reporting requirements for the 1996-2002 crop years.

[61 FR 37618, July 18, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 34612, June 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1435.2  Definitions.

    The definitions set forth in this section are applicable for all 
purposes of program administration. The terms defined in part 718 of 
this title are also applicable.
    Beet sugar means sugar which is processed directly or indirectly 
from sugar beets or sugar beet molasses.
    Cane sugar refiner means a person who processes raw cane sugar into 
refined crystalline sugar or liquid sugar.
    CCC means the Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.
    Crop year for the 1996 crop means the period from July 1, 1996 
through September 30, 1997. Crop year for the 1997-2001 crops means the 
period from October 1 through September 30, inclusive, and is identified 
by the year in which the crop year begins. For example, the 1997 crop 
year begins on October 1, 1997. The 1997 crop of sugar beets, sugarcane, 
or sugar means domestically-produced sugar beets, domestically-produced 
sugarcane, or sugar processed from domestically-produced sugar beets or 
sugarcane during the 1997 crop year. Crop year for the 2002 crop means 
the period from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003. Sugar from 
desugaring molasses is considered to be from the crop year the 
desugaring took place.
    First processor means a person who commercially produces beet sugar 
or raw cane sugar, directly or indirectly,

[[Page 412]]

from domestically-produced sugar beets or sugarcane, or from molasses or 
thick juice derived from domestically-produced sugar beets or sugarcane.
    Market means, relative to any first processor, the shipment in 
conjunction with a sale or other disposition, or the forfeiture to CCC, 
of beet sugar or raw cane sugar by the first processor of such sugar, 
and the movement of raw cane sugar into the refining process. Beet sugar 
or raw cane sugar is deemed to be marketed as of the date of shipment 
from the first processor's facility, the date on which raw cane sugar 
was moved into the refining process, or the date on which sugar was 
forfeited to CCC.
    Nonrecourse loan means a loan for which the eligible sugar offered 
as loan collateral may be delivered or forfeited to CCC, at loan 
maturity, in satisfaction of the loan indebtedness.
    Raw sugar means any sugar which is to be further refined or improved 
in quality.
    Raw value of any quantity of sugar means its equivalent in terms of 
raw sugar testing 96 sugar degrees, as determined by a polarimetric test 
performed in accordance with procedures recognized by the International 
Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA). Direct-
consumption sugar derived from sugar beets and testing 92 or more sugar 
degrees by the polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value 
by multiplying the actual number of pounds of such sugar by 1.07. Sugar 
derived from sugarcane and testing 92 sugar degrees or more by the 
polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value in the following 
manner: raw value = {[(actual degree of polarization - 92 )  x  0.0175 ] 
+ 0.93}  x  actual weight. For sugar testing less than 92 sugar degrees 
by the polariscope, derive raw value by dividing the number of pounds of 
the ``total sugar content'' (i.e., the sum of the sucrose and invert 
sugars) thereof by 0.972.
    Recourse loan means a loan that requires repayment in full on or 
before the maturity date and forfeiture of the sugar does not 
necessarily satisfy the loan indebtedness.
    Sugar means any grade or type of saccharine product derived, 
directly or indirectly, from sugarcane or sugar beets and consisting of, 
or containing, sucrose or invert sugar, including all raw sugar, refined 
crystalline sugar, liquid sugar, edible molasses, and cane syrup.
    Sugar beet processor means a person who produces sugar by 
commercially processing sugar beets or sugar beet molasses.
    Sugarcane processor means a person who produces raw cane sugar by 
commercially processing sugarcane or sugarcane molasses.
    Tariff-rate quota means the total of the aggregate quantities of raw 
cane sugar and other sugars, syrups and molasses established, or 
subsequently modified, by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of 
additional U.S. note 5(a) to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTS) for imports to be entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, under subheadings 1701.11.10,

of access to the premises of any sugar beet processor, sugarcane 
processor, cane sugar refiner, or of any other person having custody of 
records that the examining agency deems necessary to verify compliance

    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action which 
is not in accordance with part 1435.
    (d) No provision or delegation herein to a State or county committee 
shall preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, (Administrator, FSA) 
from determining any question arising under the program or from 
reversing or modifying any State or county committee determination.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator, FSA, may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines and other program requirements 
in cases where lateness or failure to meet such requirements do not 
adversely affect program operation.
    (f) A CCC representative may execute loans and related documents 
only under the terms and conditions CCC determines and announces. Any 
such document which is not executed in accordance with such terms and 
conditions, including any purported execution prior to the CCC-
authorized date, shall be null and void.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.102  Loan types.

    (a) CCC will make available to eligible processors of the 1996 
through 2002 crops of domestically-produced sugar beets and sugarcane:
    (1) Recourse loans if the tariff-rate quota is not above 1,500,000 
short tons, raw value, at the time of loan approval and has never been 
above 1,500,000 short tons, raw value, at any time during the fiscal 
year;
    (2) Nonrecourse loans if the tariff rate quota exceeds 1,500,000 
short tons, raw value, at the time of loan approval or has exceeded 
1,500,000 short tons, raw value, at any time during the fiscal year.
    (b) Outstanding recourse loans will be automatically converted to 
nonrecourse loans if the tariff-rate quota is increased to a level above 
1,500,000 short tons, raw value. However, if the recourse loan recipient 
pays the principal amount of the loan, plus interest, within 30 days 
from the date the tariff-rate quota was increased, then the loan will be 
treated for all purposes whatsoever as if it had not been converted to a 
nonrecourse loan. Once nonrecourse loans are made available, they will 
not be converted to recourse loans any time during the fiscal year, even 
if the tariff-rate quota is subsequently reduced to a level equal to, or 
less than, 1,500,000 short tons, raw value.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.103  Loan rates.

    (a) The national average loan rate for raw cane sugar produced from 
the 1996 through 2002 crops of domestically-grown sugarcane is 18 cents 
per pound, raw value.
    (b) The national average loan rate for refined beet sugar from 1996-
2002-crop domestically-grown sugar beets is 22.90 cents per pound of 
refined beet sugar.
    (c) The loan rates for eligible sugar are adjusted to reflect the 
processing location of the sugar offered as loan

collateral and are available from State and county offices.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.104  Eligibility requirements.

    (a) An eligible producer is the owner of a portion or all of the 
domestically-produced sugar beets or sugarcane, including share rent 
landowners, at both the time of harvest and the time of delivery to the 
processor, except producers determined to be ineligible as a result of 
the regulations governing highly erodible land and wetland conservation 
found at 7 CFR part 12, regulations governing crop insurance at 7 CFR 
part 400, or the regulations governing controlled substance violations 
at 7 CFR part 718.
    (b) A sugar beet or sugarcane processor is eligible for loans if the 
processor agrees to all the terms and conditions in the loan application 
and the note and security agreement.
    (c) Sugar pledged as collateral during the crop year:
    (1) May not exceed the quantity derived from processing 
domestically-grown sugar beets or sugarcane from eligible producers 
during the applicable crop year;
    (2) Must be processed and owned by the eligible processor and stored 
in suitable storage;
    (3) May not have been processed from imported sugarcane, sugar

    (3) Sugarcane syrup or edible molasses must be free from any 
objectionable color, flavor, odor, or other characteristic which would 
impair the merchantability of such syrup or molasses or would impair or 
prevent the use of such syrup or molasses for normal commercial 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.105  Availability, disbursement, and maturity of loans.

    (a) To obtain a loan, a processor must:
    (1) File a loan request, as CCC prescribes, no later than September 
30, 1997, for the 1996 crop year, no earlier than October 1 and no later 
than September 30 of the applicable crop year for the 1997-2001 crop 
years, and no earlier than October 1, 2002 and no later than June 30, 
2003, for the 2002 crop year, with the State committee of the State 
where such processor is headquartered, or with a county committee 
designated by the State committee;
    (2) Execute a note and security agreement as CCC prescribes; and
    (3) Pay CCC a loan service fee in connection with the disbursement 
of each loan. The Executive Vice President, CCC, will determine and 
announce the service fee amount.
    (b) If there are any liens or encumbrances on sugar pledged as 
collateral for a loan, the processor must obtain waivers that fully 
protect CCC's interest even though the liens or encumbrances are 
satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional liens or encumbrances 
shall be placed on the sugar after the loan is approved.
    (c) No loan proceeds may be disbursed until the sugar has actually 
been processed and is otherwise established as being eligible to be 
pledged as loan collateral.
    (d) A processor may, within the loan availability period, repledge 
as collateral sugar that previously served as loan collateral for a 
repaid loan.

[[Page 415]]

    (1) In making application for such loan, the processor shall:
    (i) Specify that the loan collateral should be treated as a quantity 
of eligible sugar that previously served as loan collateral for a repaid 
loan; and
    (ii) Designate the loan to which the reoffered loan collateral was 
originally pledged.
    (2) The subsequent loan shall have the same maturity date as the 
original loan.
    (3) Loan collateral repledged that was previously redeemed from CCC 
is not included in determining the total quantity of sugar on which 
loans have been obtained for purposes of Sec. 1435.104.
    (e)(1) Disbursements shall be made without regard to the actual 
polarity of the sugar pledged as loan collateral but shall be made on 
the assumption that the polarity of such sugar is 96 degrees by the 
polariscope.
    (2) Adjustments for polarity are only made at the time of loan 
forfeiture.
    (f)(1) Loans will mature at the earlier of:
    (i) the end of the 9-month period beginning on the 1st day of the 
first month after the month in which the loan is made; or
    (ii) September 30 following disbursement of the loan.
    (2) CCC may accelerate loan maturity dates in accordance with 
Sec. 1435.107(g).
    (g) Processors receiving loans in July, August, or September may 
repledge the sugar as collateral for a supplemental loan. Such 
supplemental loan shall:
    (1) Be requested by the processor during the following October;
    (2) Be recourse or nonrecourse depending on which type of loan is in 
effect according to Sec. 1435.102;
    (3) Be made at the loan rate in effect at the time the supplemental 
loan is made; and
    (4) Mature in 9 months minus the number of whole months that the 
initial loan was in effect.
    (h) No loans will be made after June 30, 2003.

<R05>
Sec. 1435.106  Loan maintenance.

    (a) All processors receiving loans shall:
    (1) Abide by the terms and conditions of the loan application and 
the note and security agreement; and
    (2) Pay interest on the principal at a rate determined in part 1405.
    (b) The security interests obtained by CCC as a result of the 
execution of security agreements by the processors of sugarcane and 
sugar beets shall be superior to all statutory and common law liens on 
raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar in favor of the producers of 
sugarcane and sugar beets and all prior recorded and unrecorded liens on 
the crops of sugarcane and sugar beets from which the sugar was derived.
    (c) Nonrecourse loan recipients shall pay all eligible producers who 
have delivered or will deliver sugar beets or sugarcane to such 
processor for processing not less than the minimum payment levels CCC 
specifies for the applicable crop year when nonrecourse loans are in 
effect, except that processors who repay a recourse loan within the 30-
day period provided for in Sec. 1435.102(b) are not required to pay the 
minimum payment levels.
    (d) A processor shall maintain eligible sugar of sufficient quality 
and quantity as collateral to satisfy the processor's loan indebtedness 
to CCC. CCC shall not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the loan 
collateral.
    (1) The borrower is responsible for storage costs through the loan 
maturity date.
    (2) Sugar pledged as loan collateral need not be stored identity 
preserved.
    (3) When the proceeds of the sale of the sugar pledged as loan 
collateral are needed to repay all or part of a sugar loan, the 
processor may request and obtain prior written approval from the 
loanmaking office by executing a Market Authorization for Loan 
Collateral (form CCC-681-1) to remove a specified quantity of the loan 
collateral from storage for the purpose of delivering it to a buyer 
prior to repayment of the loan. Any such approval shall be subject to 
the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form and the 
loanmaking office shall not approve such a request unless the buyer of 
the sugar agrees to pay CCC an amount

[[Page 416]]

necessary to satisfy the processor's loan indebtedness regarding the 
sugar being sold. Any such approval shall not:
    (i) Constitute a release of CCC's security interest in the sugar; or
    (ii) Relieve the processor of liability for the full amount of the 
loan indebtedness, including interest.
    (4) If CCC determines, by actual measurement or otherwise, that the 
actual quantity serving as collateral for a recourse or nonrecourse loan 
is less than the loan quantity, because of incorrect certification, 
unauthorized removal, or unauthorized disposition, CCC may call the loan 
and other outstanding loans. Such determination shall result in the 
processor being ineligible for recourse loans for the remainder of that 
crop year and through the next crop year.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.107  Loan settlement and foreclosure.

    (a) A processor may, at any time prior to loan maturity, redeem all 
or any part of the loan collateral by paying CCC the applicable 
principal and interest.
    (b) Recourse loan recipients must pay CCC the principal and interest 
on the loan and redeem their sugar collateral no later than the loan 
maturity date.
    (c) Forfeiture will be accepted as payment in full of the principal 
and interest due under a nonrecourse loan, applicable to the quantity of 
sugar delivered, subject to adjustment for polarity, if the processor:
    (1) Notifies in writing the appropriate loanmaking office of the 
processor's intent to forfeit the loan collateral, states the amount of 
loan collateral intended to be forfeited, and delivers the notice to the 
loanmaking office no later than 30 days prior to the maturity date of 
the loan;
    (2) Executes a storage agreement, as CCC prescribes, prior to 
forfeiture or delivers the loan collateral to a CCC-approved storage 
facility upon forfeiture; and
    (3) Pays the following forfeiture penalty on sugar pledged as 
collateral at the time of forfeiture:
    (i) The penalty for raw cane sugar is 1 cent per pound; and
    (ii) The penalty for beet sugar is 1.072 cents per pound; and
    (4) Reduces payments owed producers by the producer's share of the 
aggregate loan forfeiture penalty incurred by the processor. The 
producer's share of the aggregate loan forfeiture penalty is calculated 
as the producer's share of the net selling price of the processor's 
sugar, provided for explicitly or implicitly in the contract between 
producers and processor, times the aggregate loan forfeiture penalty.
    (d) Even though a processor gave notice of intent to forfeit, the 
processor may, at any time prior to maturity of the nonrecourse loan, 
redeem the loan collateral in accordance with this section.
    (e) CCC shall not accept delivery of sugar in settlement of a 
nonrecourse loan in excess of:
    (1) the amount specified in the notice of intent to forfeit; or
    (2) the quantity of sugar which is shown on the note and security 
agreement minus any quantity that was redeemed or released for removal 
in accordance with this section.
    (f) If the processor does not redeem any amount of the nonrecourse 
loan collateral and the conditions of paragraph (c) of this section have 
been fulfilled, the unredeemed nonrecourse loan collateral will, without 
further CCC or processor action, be deemed to have been forfeited and 
delivered to CCC in-store at the processor's storage facility on the day 
following the maturity date of the loan. Title, all rights, and interest 
to the sugar immediately vests in CCC upon delivery.
    (g)(1) CCC may at any time accelerate the date for loan repayment 
indebtedness, including interest. CCC will give the processor notice of 
such acceleration at least 15 days in advance of the accelerated loan 
maturity date.
    (2) In the event of any such acceleration of nonrecourse loans, the 
required notice of intent to forfeit, as set forth in paragraph (d)(1), 
may be given at any time prior to the accelerated maturity date.
    (h) If a processor's recourse or nonrecourse loan indebtedness is 
not satisfied in accordance with the provisions of this section:

[[Page 417]]

    (1) Interest on the processor's indebtedness shall accrue as 
specified in part 1403 in this chapter and shall accrue until the debt 
is paid;
    (2) CCC may, upon notice, with or without removing the collateral 
from storage, sell such collateral at either a public or private sale; 
and
    (3) The processor shall be liable for the deficiency if the net 
proceeds are less than the amount of principal, interest, and any other 
charges incurred by the CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.108  Storage facility requirements.

    (a) Sugar forfeited to CCC must be delivered in or to a CCC-approved 
storage facility.
    (1) Eligible storage is any storage facility which:
    (i) Meets CCC Standards for Approval of Dry and Cold Storage 
Warehouses for Processed Agricultural Commodities, Extracted Honey, and 
Bulk Oils (part 1423 of this chapter); and
    (ii) Is placed under a storage contract with CCC.
    (2) If the sugar is delivered in or to an ineligible storage 
facility, the processor is responsible for all costs incurred in moving 
the sugar to an eligible storage facility.
    (b) CCC has the right to inspect loan collateral or CCC-owned sugar 
and the storage facilities in which the sugar is situated at any time.
    (c) Regardless of whether CCC inspected the sugar and storage 
facility prior to delivery, the processor is liable to CCC for any 
damages CCC suffers if:
    (1) The processor delivers ineligible sugar to CCC; or
    (2) The processor delivers sugar into ineligible storage.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.109  Processor storage agreement.

    (a) By executing a note and security agreement, the processor agrees 
to store any forfeited loan collateral on behalf of CCC under the terms 
and conditions specified in this subpart and any storage agreement 
entered into between CCC and the processor. Should the terms of these 
regulations and the terms of the storage agreement conflict, the terms 
set forth in the regulations are applicable.
    (b) The storing processor is responsible for maintaining the quality 
and condition of CCC-owned sugar. The processor is liable to CCC for any 
damages CCC suffers due to the failure of the processor to load out 
sugar meeting the criteria set forth in Sec. 1435.104(d). Also, the 
processor shall store the sugar in the eligible storage where delivered 
for as long as CCC deems necessary.
    (c) If a processor forfeits loan collateral and CCC and the 
processor fails to enter into a storage contract, the processor is 
responsible for all costs incurred in moving the sugar to an eligible 
storage facility.
    (d) A processor storing CCC-owned sugar is responsible for all load-
out expenses in the event that CCC sells the sugar.
    (e) CCC shall make monthly storage payments to the processor for the 
period of time the processor stores the forfeited sugar. The storage 
payment rate shall be as CCC and the processor agree, and according to 
the terms and conditions CCC sets forth when executing a note and 
security agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.110  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) The regulations issued by the Secretary governing setoffs and 
withholding set forth at part 3 of this title and part 1403 of this 
chapter are applicable to the program set forth in this subpart.
    (b) A producer or processor may obtain reconsideration and review of 
determinations made under this subpart in accordance with the 
regulations at 7 CFR part 780.
    (c) Any false certification, including those made for the purpose of 
enabling a processor to obtain a loan to which it is not entitled, will 
subject the person making such certification to liability under 
applicable Federal civil and criminal statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.111  Applicable forms.

    CCC forms used for this program are available from the appropriate 
State committee or designated county committee. For purposes of any CCC 
form that refers to program participation by producers, the term 
``producer'' shall be taken to mean ``processor.''

during fiscal years 1996 through 2003 from domestically-produced 
sugarcane or sugarcane molasses, and
    (2) First processor marketings of all beet sugar processed during 
fiscal years 1996 through 2003 from domestically-produced sugar beets or 
sugar beet molasses.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.201  Marketing assessment rates.

    (a) For marketings during fiscal year 1996, the assessment rate per 
pound of beet sugar is 0.2123 cents per pound. The assessment rate for 
fiscal years 1997 through 2003 is 0.2654 cents per pound.
    (b) For marketings during fiscal year 1996, the assessment rate per 
pound of raw cane sugar is 0.1980 cents per pound, raw value. The 
assessment rate for fiscal years 1997 through 2003 is 0.2475 cents per 
pound, raw value.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.202  Remittance.

    (a) The monthly amount of the beet sugar marketing assessment to be 
remitted to CCC is determined by multiplying the number of pounds of 
beet sugar marketed in the calendar month by the assessment rate.
    (b) The monthly amount of the marketing assessment on raw cane sugar 
to be remitted to CCC is determined by multiplying the number of pounds, 
raw value, of raw cane sugar marketed, or estimated to be marketed in 
accordance with (e)(1) of this section, in the calendar month by the 
assessment rate.
    (c)(1) First processors shall remit marketing assessments to CCC no 
later than the 30th calendar day following the end of the month in which 
the beet sugar or raw cane sugar subject to the assessment was marketed.
    (2) Mailed remittances will be considered timely if they are 
postmarked not later than the 25th calendar day following the month in 
which the beet sugar or cane sugar subject to the assessment was 
marketed.
    (3) CCC must receive electronic remittances by the 30th calendar day 
following the month in which the beet sugar or raw cane sugar subject to 
the assessment was marketed.
    (4) Any processor who fails to file a remittance by the due date 
shall be assessed a civil penalty and interest in accordance with 
Sec. 1435.203.
    (d)(1) First processors shall prepare and submit a fully and 
accurately completed form CCC-80 each month that shows:
    (i) Beet sugar marketings during the previous calendar month; and
    (ii) Raw cane sugar, raw value, marketings during the previous 
calendar month.
    (2) First processors who do not operate on a calendar month basis 
may pay their assessments based on marketings on several extra days or 
fewer days than the calendar month reporting period, consistent with the 
processor's standard accounting period. However:
    (i) Assessments must be paid on all marketings of specific crop year 
sugar in the fiscal year it is due; and
    (ii) The marketing assessments must be remitted monthly and by the 
dates specified in this section.
    (3) The entire assessment that is due and payable shall be remitted 
with the Form CCC-80.
    (e)(1) If, when a raw cane sugar assessment is due and payable, the 
first processor cannot determine the exact raw value of such sugar, an 
estimate of raw value based on the recent experience of the processor 
shall be made and the assessment submitted on the estimated quantity.
    (2) Whenever an assessment is based on an estimate of raw value 
pursuant to (e)(1), any necessary adjustments to the quantity of raw 
sugar subject to the assessment shall be made by filing a corrected Form 
CCC-80 no later than 30 calendar days after the last day of the month in 
which the estimated assessment was paid. If, according to the corrected 
Form CCC-80:

[[Page 419]]

    (i) The assessment was underpaid, the first processor shall remit 
the additional assessment due with the corrected Form CCC-80, and
    (ii) If the assessment was overpaid, the first processor shall 
subtract the overpayment from any assessment due at the time the 
corrected Form CCC-80 is filed, or if none is due at that time, from the 
assessment next due.
    (f) By October 30 of each year, first processors shall determine the 
quantity of beet sugar or raw cane sugar on hand that was produced 
during the preceding fiscal year but not marketed by September 30 of 
such preceding fiscal year and shall remit a marketing assessment to CCC 
as if the sugar had been marketed in September of such preceding fiscal 
year. Such sugar is not subject to a second assessment when it is 
marketed.
    (g) First processors shall send remittances and CCC-80 forms as CCC 
specifies.


<R05>
Sec. 1435.203  Civil penalties and interest.

    (a) A first processor is liable for a civil penalty of up to 100 
percent of the relevant national average loan rate times the marketings

this section, interest on unpaid assessments or deficiencies in 
assessments paid is due and payable at the rate specified in part 1403 
of this chapter beginning on the 1st day of the month after the 
marketing assessment was due in accordance with Sec. 1435.203. Interest 
shall continue to accrue until such amount is paid. However, if full 
payment of an assessment is received within 30 calendar days of the date 
on which the assessment was due, no interest shall apply.
    (c) The Controller, CCC, shall assess civil penalties and interest.
    (d) Affected first processors may request reconsideration of civil 
penalties by filing a request, within 30 days of receipt of certified 
written notification by the Controller, CCC, of such assessment of civil 
penalties, with the Executive Vice President, CCC, Stop 0501, 1400 
Independence Ave. SW, Washington, D.C. 20250-0501.
    (e) After reconsideration, affected first processors may appeal 
civil penalties by filing a notice of appeal, within 30 calendar days of

Sec. 1437.1  Applicability.

    (a) For the 1997 and subsequent crop years, NAP is intended to 
provide eligible producers of eligible crops with protection comparable 
to the catastrophic risk protection plan of crop insurance. NAP is also 
designed to help reduce production risks faced by producers of crops for 
which Federal crop insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as 
amended is not available. NAP will reduce financial losses that occur 
when natural disasters cause a catastrophic loss of production or 
prevented planting of an eligible crop. Payment eligibility is based on 
an expected yield for the area and the producer's approved yield based 
on actual production history, or a transitional yield if sufficient 
production records are not available. In the case of forage determined 
by CCC to be predominantly grazed in accordance with Sec. 1437.7(j), 
payment eligibility is based on an expected stocking level for the area 
and unit and the actual number of animals grazed and days grazing 
occurred. Production for both the applicable area expected yield and the 
individual producer approved yield for the unit or for forage determined 
by CCC to be predominantly grazed, area and unit expected stocking level 
must each fall below specified percentages in order to be eligible for 
payments under this part.
    (b) The provisions contained in this part are applicable to each 
eligible producer and each eligible crop for which catastrophic coverage 
is not otherwise available.

Sec. 1437.2  Administration.

    (a) NAP is administered under the general supervision of the 
Executive Vice-President, CCC (Administrator, Farm Service Agency), and 
shall be carried out by State and county FSA committees (State and 
county committees).
    (b) State and county committees, and representatives and their 
employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any of the 
provisions of the regulations of this part.

[[Page 421]]

    (c) The State committee shall take any action required by these 
regulations that the county committee has not taken. The State committee 
shall also:
    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the 
regulations of this part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, from 
determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or 
modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines, except statutory deadlines, and 
other program requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet 
such other requirements does not adversely affect operation of the 
program.
    (f) The State committee will, in accordance with this part, 
recommend the geographical size and shape of the area where a natural 
disaster has occurred, and whether the area eligibility requirement has 
been satisfied. The recommendation of eligibility must be approved by 
the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee.
    (g) The Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, will determine 
all yields and prices under this part.

    Animal unit (AU) means an animal with daily energy requirement 
equating to 15.7 pounds of corn.
    Animal unit day (AUD) means an expression of an expected or actual 
stocking rate.
    Approved yield means an actual production history yield calculated 
and approved by CCC, used to determine any NAP payment in accordance 
with part 400, subpart G, of this title.
    Aquacultural species means any species of aquatic organism grown as 
food for human consumption, or fish raised as feed for fish that are 
consumed by humans, or ornamental fish propagated and reared in an 
aquatic medium by a commercial operator on private property in water in 
a controlled environment. Eligible aquacultural species must be seeded 
in the aquacultural facility and not be growing naturally in the 
facility and must be planted or seeded in containers, wire baskets, net 
pens, or similar devices designed for the protection and containment of 
the seeded aquacultural species.
    Area means the geographic region recommended by the State FSA 
committee, and approved by CCC in accordance with Sec. 1437.6, where a 
natural disaster has occurred which may qualify producers in the area 
for NAP payments.
    Assigned yield means a yield assigned for a crop year in the base 
period, in accordance with part 400, subpart G, of this title, if the 
producer does not file an acceptable production report by the production 
reporting date.
    Average market price means the price, or dollar equivalent on an 
appropriate

[[Page 422]]

basis for an eligible crop established by CCC for determining payment 
amounts under NAP; for example, pound, bushel, ton, and AUD (for forage 
determined by CCC to be predominantly grazed). Such price will be on a 
harvested basis without the inclusion of transportation, storage, 
processing, packing, marketing or other post-harvest expenses and will 
be based, in part, on historical data.
    Carrying capacity means the stocking rate, as determined by CCC, 
expressed as acres per animal unit (AC/AU) or reciprocal, which is 
consistent with maintaining or improving vegetation or related 
resources.
    Catastrophic coverage means a catastrophic risk protection plan of 
insurance offered by FCIC in accordance with part 402 of this title.
    CCC means the Commodity Credit Corporation, a wholly owned 
Government corporation within the United States Department of 
Agriculture.
    County expected yield means the eligible crop yield established by 
the State FSA committee and approved by CCC for the county. Such yield 
information may be obtained from National Agricultural Statistics 
Service, Cooperative States Research, Education, and Extension Service, 
credible nongovernmental studies, yields in similar areas, and similar 
reference material. For planted annual crops, such yield will be based 
on the acreage planted for harvest.
    Crop year means the period of time within which the crop is normally 
grown and designated by the calendar year in which the crop is normally 
harvested in the area. For crops harvested over two calendar years, the 
crop year will be the calendar year in which the majority of the crop 
would have been harvested. For crops grown over more than two calendar 
years, each year in the growing period will be considered as a separate 
crop year designated by the calendar year in which the crop sustained a 
loss. For crops for which catastrophic coverage is available, the crop 
year will be as defined by such coverage.
    Eligible crop means an agricultural commodity for which catastrophic 
coverage is not available and which is commercially produced for food or 
fiber as specified in this part. Eligible crop will also include 
floriculture, ornamental nursery, and Christmas tree crops, turfgrass 
sod, seed crops, aquaculture (including ornamental fish), and industrial 
crops. In the case of a crop that historically has multiple plantings in 
the same crop year that are planted or are prevented from being planted, 
each planting may be considered a different crop for determining 
payments under this part as determined by CCC. In the case of a crop, 
except for forage determined by CCC to be predominantly grazed, that has 
different varieties or types, each variety or type may be considered a 
separate crop for determining payments under this part, if CCC 
determines there is a significant difference in price or yield between 
the varieties or types.
    Expected area yield means the eligible crop yield established and 
approved by CCC for the geographic area.
    Floriculture means cut flowers or similar products of annual and 
perennial flowering plants grown under glass, fiberglass and other rigid 
plastics, film plastic, shade cloth, natural shade, other shade, and 
outdoor in a container or controlled environment for commercial sale.
    Forage means land covered with grass or other similar herbaceous 
vegetation not of a woody plant species, produced under such range 
management practices as are necessary to sustain sufficient quality and 
quantity of grass or similar vegetation each year to be suitable for 
grazing or mechanical harvest to feed livestock in a commercial 
operation. NAP benefits for forage produced on Federal or State owned 
lands are available only for seeded forage.
    Good farming practices means the cultural practices generally used 
in the area for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and 
produce at least the individual unit approved yield. The practices are 
normally those recognized by Cooperative State Research, Education, and 
Extension Service as compatible with agronomic and weather conditions in 
the area.
    Grazing days means the number of days used in the calculation of the 
carrying capacity for each forage species or type or variety determined 
by CCC to be predominantly grazed.

[[Page 423]]

    Harvested means a single harvest crop is considered harvested when 
the producer has, by hand or mechanically, or by grazing of livestock, 
removed the crop from the field. Crops with multiple harvests in 1 year 
or harvested over multiple years are considered harvested when the 
producer has, by hand or mechanically removed at least one mature crop 
from the field. The mechanically harvested crop is considered harvested 
once it is removed from the field and placed in a truck or other 
conveyance, except hay is considered harvested when in the bale, whether 
removed from the field or not. Grazing is not considered harvesting for 
the purpose of determining an unharvested or prevented planting payment 
factor.
    Livestock means any farm or other animal excluding aquacultural 
species and, including but not limited to domestic avian, ruminant, 
equine, and swine species grown or maintained for any purpose.
    Local office means the FSA office or other USDA office designated by 
CCC.
    Native forage means grass or other vegetation occurring naturally 
without seeding.
    Natural disaster means damaging weather, including but not limited 
to drought, hail, excessive moisture, freeze, tornado, hurricane, 
excessive wind, or any combination thereof; or adverse natural 
occurrence such as earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption; or related 
condition, including but not limited to heat, insect infestation, or 
disease, which occurs as a result of an adverse natural occurrence or 
damaging weather occurring prior to or during harvest that directly 
causes, accelerates, or exacerbates the destruction or deterioration of 
an eligible crop, as determined by the Secretary.
    Ornamental fish means a decorative fish produced in a commercial 
fishery for sale.
    Ornamental nursery means decorative plants grown in a container or 
controlled environment for commercial sale.
    Ornamental nursery crop means a decorative plant grown in a 
container or controlled environment for commercial sale.
    Prevented planting means the inability to plant a crop with proper 
equipment during the planting period for the crop or commodity. A 
producer must prove that the producer intended to plant the eligible 
crop and that such crop could not be planted due to natural disaster 
reasonably related to the basis for the area designation under 
Sec. 1437.6, as determined by the Executive Vice President. The natural 
disaster that caused the prevented planting must have occurred after the 
final planting date for the previous crop year and before the final 
planting date for the crop year in which a request for NAP payment was 
made. For crops with multiple plantings in a single crop year and one 
crop has been harvested, the natural disaster must occur, after the 
harvest of the harvested crop and before the end of the planting period 
for the next planting of the crop.
    Production report means a written record showing the commodity's 
annual production and used to determine the producer's yield for NAP 
purposes. The report contains yield history by unit, if applicable, 
including planted acreage for annual crops, eligible acreage for 
perennial crops, and harvested and FCIC or CCC appraised production for 
the previous crop years. This report must be supported by verifiable 
written records, measurement of farm-stored production, or by other 
records of production approved by CCC. Information contained in an 
application for payment is considered a production report for the unit 
for the crop year for which the application was filed.
    Qualifying gross revenues means:
    (1) With respect to a person who receives more than 50 percent of 
such person's gross income from farming, ranching, and forestry 
operations, the annual gross income for the taxable year from such 
operations; and
    (2) With respect to a person who receives 50 percent or less of such 
person's gross income from farming, ranching, and forestry operations, 
the person's total gross income for the taxable year from all sources.
    Reseeded or replanted crop means the same crop planted on the same 
acreage after the first planting of the crop has failed.
    Seed crop means a crop produced for the purpose of, or intended for 
use as, commercial propagation for sale.

[[Page 424]]

    Seeded forage means acreage which is mechanically seeded with 
grasses or other vegetation at regular intervals, at least every 7 
years, in accordance with good farming practices.
    Share means the producer's percentage of interest in the eligible 
crop as an owner, operator, or tenant. For the purpose of determining 
eligibility for payments under this part, the producer's share will not 
exceed the producer's share at the earlier of the time of loss or the 
beginning of harvest. Acreage or interest attributed to a spouse, child, 
or member of the same household may be considered part of the producer's 
share unless such individual is considered to be a separate person under 
part 1400 of this chapter.
    Stocking rate means the number of animal units grazing or utilizing 
specific crop acreage for a specific number of days, expressed as animal 
unit days.
    Type and weight range means the identification of animals according 
to the daily energy requirement, as determined by CCC, necessary to 
provide the daily maintenance ration, as determined by CCC, of the 
specific animal.
    Type or Variety means a scientifically recognized subspecies of a 
crop or commodity having a particular characteristic or set of 
characteristics.
    Unit means, for NAP, all acreage of the eligible crop or for 
ornamental nursery, all eligible plant species and sizes except plant 
species or sizes for which catastrophic coverage is available, in the 
county for the crop year:
    (1) In which the person has 100 percent crop share; or
    (2) Which is owned by one person and operated by another person on a 
share basis.
    Value loss crop means ornamental nursery, Christmas trees, 
aquaculture, or other crops as determined by CCC that, due to their 
unique nature do not lend themselves to yield calculations or expected 
yield loss situations. Eligibility for a crop categorized as value loss 
shall be determined based on a loss of value at time of disaster, as 
determined by CCC.

produced for sale as seed stock for other eligible NAP crop production; 
and
    (11) Any crop, for which crop insurance under the Federal Crop 
Insurance Act is available in the county, that is affected by a natural 
disaster that is not named as an insurable peril under the producer's 
crop insurance policy.
    (c) NAP payments will not be available for any acreage in any area 
for any crop for which catastrophic coverage is available, unless the 
loss was caused by a natural disaster that is not covered by 
catastrophic coverage and all other eligibility requirements under this 
part are satisfied.

<R05>
Sec. 1437.5  Assistance.

    (a) Producers who are eligible to receive NAP payments for crop 
years 1996

[[Page 425]]

through 1998 will receive assistance against loss in yield greater than 
50 percent of the producer's approved yield for the eligible crop 
payable at 60 percent of the established average market price for the 
crop.
    (b) Producers who are eligible to receive NAP payments after crop 
year 1998 will receive assistance against loss in yield greater than 50 
percent of the producer's approved yield for the eligible crop payable 
at 55 percent of the established average market price for the crop.
    (c) CCC will adjust the NAP payment rate for crops that are produced 
with significant and variable expenses that are not incurred because the 
crop acreage was prevented from being planted or planted but not 
harvested.
    (d) NAP payments will be determined by unit based on all the acreage 
and production of the crop and eligible prevented from being planted 
acreage of the crop.
    (e) Each producer's NAP payment will be based on the producer's 
share of the eligible crop.
    (f) Animal Unit Day value will be established by CCC on the basis of 
a 5 year national average corn price per pound, as determined by CCC, 
and the daily energy requirement of one beef cow, as determined by CCC.

[61 FR 69005, Dec. 31, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 53931, Oct. 17, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1437.6  Area.

    (a) For the purposes of this part, acreage affected by a natural 
disaster, or any adjustment thereto, will be included in the area 
recommended by the state FSA committee and submitted to CCC for 
approval, regardless of whether the commodity produced on the affected 
acreage suffered a loss.
    (b) Except for eligible areas identified in paragraph (f) of this 
section, an approved area shall include at least five producers of crops 
on separate and distinct farms for which the area has been approved for 
NAP payments. Notwithstanding this provision, CCC may approve an area 
having fewer than five producers if the Executive Vice President, or a 
designee, determines that such area will suffer significant economic 
consequences as a result of the disaster.
    (c) An area may be designated as follows:
    (1) A county;
    (2) Aggregated acreage that is at least 320,000 acres; or
    (3) Aggregated acreage with not less than $80 million average value 
for all crops produced annually.
    (d) If the aggregated acreage affected by the natural disaster does 
not meet the minimum requirement specified in paragraph (c) (2) or (3) 
of this section, the aggregated acreage will be expanded by adding acres 
from around the affected acreage, until the minimum requirement is met.
    (e) The area may not be defined in any manner that intentionally 
includes or excludes producers or crops.
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
section, for areas outside the 50 states of the United States, the area 
shall include 10 or more producers of the crop except CCC may approve an 
area outside the 50 United States having fewer than 10 producers of the 
crop for which the area is requested if the Executive Vice President 
determines that such area will suffer significant economic consequences 
as a result of the disaster.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.7  Yield determinations.

    (a) CCC will establish expected area yields or an equivalent measure 
in the event yield data are not available, for eligible crops for each 
county or area for which the NAP is available, using available 
information, which may include, but is not limited to, National 
Agricultural Statistics Service data, Cooperative State Research, 
Education, and Extension Service records, Federal Crop Insurance 
Corporation data, credible nongovernment studies, yields in similar 
areas, and reported approved yield data. For planted annual crops, such 
yields will be based on the acreage planted for harvest.
    (b) CCC may make county yield adjustments taking into consideration 
different yield variations due to different farming practices in the 
county such as: irrigated, nonirrigated, organic, nonorganic, different 
types and varieties of a crop and intended use.
    (c) In establishing expected area yields for eligible crops:

[[Page 426]]

    (1) If the approved area corresponds to a single county, the 
expected area yield will be the yield established by CCC for that 
county, including any adjustments permitted by this section;
    (2) If the approved area encompasses portions of counties or more 
than one county, the expected area yield will be the weighted average of 
the yields established by CCC for those counties in the area, including 
any adjustments permitted by this section; and
    (3) CCC may adjust expected area yields if:
    (i) The cultural practices, including the age of the planting or 
plantings, are different from those used to establish the yield; or
    (ii) The expected area yield established on a state or county level 
is determined to be incorrect for the area.
    (d) CCC will establish approved yields for purposes of providing 
assistance under this part. Approved yields for the eligible crop will 
be based on the producer's actual production history in accordance with 
the provisions of part 400, subpart G, of this title.
    (e) The approved yield established for the producer for the year in 
which the NAP payments are offered will be equal to the average of the 
consecutive crop year yields, as established by CCC, reported and 
certified by that producer for that eligible crop.
    (f) If a producer receives an assigned yield for a year of natural 
disaster because production records were not submitted by the production 
reporting deadline, the producer will be ineligible to receive an 
assigned yield for the year of the next natural disaster unless adequate 
production records for the eligible crop from all the interim crop years 
are provided to the local office. The producer shall receive a zero 
yield for those years the producer is ineligible to receive an assigned 
yield.
    (g) CCC will select certain producers on a random or targeted basis 
and require those selected to provide records acceptable to CCC to 
support the information provided. Producers may also be required to 
support the yield certification at the time of loss adjustment or on 
post-audit. Each certification must be supported by records acceptable 
to CCC. Failure to produce records acceptable to CCC will result in CCC 
establishing the yield in accordance with actual production history and 
may subject the producer to criminal and civil false claims actions 
under various Federal statutes as well as refund of any amount received. 
In addition, sanctions, as set out at Sec. 1437.16, may be imposed for 
false certification.
    (h) Records acceptable to CCC may include:
    (1) Commercial receipts, settlement sheets, warehouse ledger sheets, 
or load summaries if the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of 
through commercial channels provided the records are reliable or 
verifiable; and
    (2) Such documentary evidence as is necessary in order to verify the 
information provided by the producer if the eligible crop has been sold, 
fed to livestock, or otherwise disposed of other than through commercial 
channels such as contemporaneous measurements, truck scale tickets, and 
contemporaneous diaries, provided the records are reliable or 
verifiable.
    (i) Any producer who has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment 
for production, as opposed to delivery, of an eligible crop will have 
the production adjusted upward by the amount of the production 
corresponding to the amount of the contract payment received.
    (j)(1) Producers will not be eligible to receive an assigned yield 
if the acreage of the crop in a county for the crop year has increased 
by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding seven crop 
years, unless:
    (i) The producer provides adequate records of production costs, 
acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which NAP payments are 
being sought; or
    (ii) CCC determines that the records provided under this paragraph 
are inadequate. CCC may require proof that the eligible crop could have 
been marketed at a reasonable price had the crop been harvested.
    (2) The provisions of this section will not apply if:
    (i) The crop has been inspected prior to the occurrence of a loss by 
a third party acceptable to CCC; or
    (ii) The FSA county executive director, with the concurrence of the 
FSA

[[Page 427]]

state director, makes a recommendation for an exemption from the 
requirements and such recommendation is approved by CCC.
    (k) Prior to the beginning of the crop year, CCC in its own 
discretion will with respect to forage:
    (1) Identify each species or type and variety of forage found in the 
county;
    (2) Categorize each species or type and variety of forage identified 
as either:
    (i) Predominantly mechanical harvested, or
    (ii) Predominantly grazed;
    (3) Establish a carrying capacity for each forage species or type 
and variety identified and determined by CCC to be predominantly grazed;
    (4) Determine total acreage of forage determined by CCC to be 
predominantly grazed; and
    (5) Calculate expected Animal Unit Day by dividing the total acres 
of forage in the county categorized by CCC as predominantly grazed by 
the approved carrying capacity and multiplying the result by the number 
of days of grazing used to determine the carrying capacity.
    (l) In the event CCC receives a notice of loss of forage determined 
by CCC to be predominantly grazed, CCC will:
    (1) Calculate utilized Animal Unit Day by dividing the total acres 
of forage reported to FSA determined by CCC to be predominantly grazed 
by the reported number of animal units grazed and multiplying the result 
by the number of days grazing occurred;
    (2) Subtract the value of supplemental feed fed to the grazing 
livestock during the grazing period from the value of the utilized 
Animal Unit Day, as determined by CCC;
    (3) Determine area utilization by dividing total area utilized 
Animal Unit Day by the expected Animal Unit Day; and
    (4) Determine unit utilization by dividing the unit utilized Animal 
Unit Day by the expected unit Animal Unit Day.

Sec. 1437.8  Acreage and production reports.

    (a) Producers must file one or more acreage reports at the local 
office no later than the date specified by CCC for each crop the 
producer wants to insure future eligibility for the NAP program. The 
acreage report may be filed by the farm operator. Any producer will be 
bound by the acreage report filed by the farm operator unless the 
producer files a separate acreage report prior to the acreage reporting 
date.
    (b) Acreage reports required by paragraph (a) must include all of 
the following information:
    (1) All acreage in the county of the eligible crop (for each 
planting in the event of multiple planting) in which the producer has a 
share;
    (2) The producer's share at the time of planting or the beginning of 
the crop year;
    (3) The FSA farm serial number;
    (4) The crop, practice, intended use, and for forage, the 
predominant species or type and variety and the intended harvest method, 
i.e. grazing or mechanical harvest.
    (5) All persons sharing in the crop (including the identity of any 
person having an interest in the crop as producer) and the person's 
employer identification number or social security number, if the person 
wishes to receive any payment under the Act;
    (6) The date the crop was planted; and
    (7) Acreage prevented from being planted.
    (c) For each crop for which an acreage report is filed in accordance 
with this section, the producer must report the production for that 
acreage by the immediately subsequent crop year acreage reporting date 
for the crop.
    (d) A person's failure to submit the required information by the 
designated acreage reporting dates may result in the denial of payments 
under this part. If there is a change of ownership, operation, or share 
within the farming operation after the acreage reporting date, the local 
office must be notified not later than 30 calendar days after the change 
and proof of the change must be provided to maintain eligibility for 
payments under this part.

    (e) In lieu of a production report, producers of forage that is 
predominantly grazed shall, in the crop year in which the producer files 
a notice of loss, report grazing animals by type and weight range and 
the number of days grazing occurred, and the amount and type of feed fed 
such grazing animals during any grazing period within the crop year.
    (f) Animal Unit Day adjustments, as determined by CCC, may be 
calculated when a producer of forage predominantly grazed, provides 
adequate evidence, as determined by CCC, that unit forage management and 
maintenance practices provide different carrying capacity than practices 
generally provided forage acreage used to calculate the approved county 
expected carrying capacity.

Sec. 1437.9  Loss requirements.

    (a) To qualify for payment under this part, the loss or prevented 
planting of the eligible crop must be due to a natural disaster.
    (b) Assistance under this part will not cover losses due to:
    (1) The neglect or malfeasance of the producer;
    (2) The failure of the producer to reseed or replant to the same 
crop in the county where it is practicable to reseed or replant;
    (3) The failure of the producer to follow good farming practices for 
the commodity and practice;
    (4) Water contained or released by any governmental, public, or 
private dam or reservoir project, if an easement exists on the acreage 
affected for the containment or release of the water;
    (5) Failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities; or
    (6) Except for tree crops and perennials, inadequate irrigation 
resources at the beginning of the crop year.
    (c) A producer of an eligible crop will not receive payments under 
this part unless the projected average or actual yield for the crop, or 
an equivalent measurement if yield information is not available, in the 
area falls below 65 percent of the expected area yield. Once this area, 
and all other, eligibility requirements have been satisfied:
    (1) A reduced yield payment will be made to a producer if the total 
quantity of the eligible crop that the producer is able to harvest on 
the unit is less than 50 percent of the approved yield for the crop due 
to natural disaster reasonably related to the basis for the area 
designation under Sec. 1437.6, factored for the share of the producer 
for the crop. Production from the entire unit will be used to determine 
whether the producer qualifies for a payment under this part. The 
quantity will not be reduced for any quality consideration unless a zero 
value is established; and
    (2) A prevented planting payment under this part will be made if the 
producer is prevented from planting more than 35 percent of the total 
eligible acreage intended for planting to the eligible crop. Producers 
must have intended to plant the crop and prove that they were prevented 
from planting the crop due to natural disaster reasonably related to the 
basis for the area designation under Sec. 1437.6, and the producer may 
be required to prove that such producer had the resources available to 
plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as applicable.
    (d) NAP payments under this part for prevented planting will not be 
available for:
    (1) Tree crops and other perennials, unless the producer can prove 
resources were available to plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as 
applicable;
    (2) Land that planting history or conservation plans indicate would 
remain fallow for crop rotation purposes; or
    (3) Land used for conservation purposes or intended to be or 
considered to have been left unplanted under any program administered by 
USDA, including the Conservation Reserve Program and Wetland Reserve 
Program.

<R05>
Sec. 1437.10  Application for payment and notice of loss.

    (a) Any person with a share in the eligible crop who would be 
entitled to a payment under this part must provide a notice of damage or 
loss within 15

[[Page 429]]

calendar days after the occurrence of the prevented planting (the end of 
the planting period) or recognizable damage to the crop. The notice must 
be filed at the local office serving the area where the producer's unit 
is located. The farm operator may provide the notice for all producers 
with an interest in the crop. All producers on a farm will be bound by 
the operator's filing or failure to file the application for payment 
unless the individual producers elect to timely file their notice.
    (b)(1) Applications for payments under this part must be filed, on 
Form FCI-74, by the applicant with the local office no later than the 
first acreage reporting date for the crop in the crop year immediately 
following the crop year in which the loss occurred.
    (2) If the producer chooses not to harvest the crop, all eligible 
acres and crop units for which the producer intends to make an 
application for payment must be left intact until the units have been 
appraised or released by an FCIC or CCC approved loss adjuster.
    (3) If the producer harvests the crop, the producer must provide 
such documentary evidence of crop production as CCC may require which 
may include leaving representative samples of the crop for inspection.
    (c) Failure to make timely application or to supply the required 
documentary evidence shall result in the denial of payments under this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 1437.11  Payments for reduced yields and prevented planting.

    In the event that the area loss requirement has been satisfied for 
the crop and:
    (a) The producer has sustained a loss in yield in excess of 50 
percent of the producer's approved yield established for the crop, the 
NAP low yield payment will be determined by:
    (1) Multiplying the producer's approved yield by the total eligible 
acreage planted to the eligible crop;
    (2) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(1) by 50 percent;
    (3) Subtracting the total production from the total eligible acreage 
from the result in paragraph (a)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(3) by the producer's 
share of the eligible crop;
    (5) Multiplying the result of paragraph (a)(4) by the applicable 
payment factor in accordance with Sec. 1437.5(c); and
    (6) Multiplying the result in paragraph (a)(5) by:
    (i) For the 1996 through 1998 crop years, 60 percent of the average 
market price, as determined by CCC, or any comparable coverage, as 
determined by CCC; or
    (ii) For the 1999 and subsequent years, 55 percent of the average 
market price, as determined by CCC, or any comparable coverage, as 
determined by CCC; or
    (b) The producer has been unable to plant at least 35 percent of the 
acreage intended for the eligible crop, the NAP payment will be 
determined by:
    (1) Multiplying the producer's acreage intended to be planted to the 
eligible crop by 35 percent;
    (2) Subtracting the result in (b)(1) from the number of eligible 
prevented planting acres as determined in Sec. 1437.9(c)(2);
    (3) Multiplying the result of (b)(2) by the producer's share of the 
eligible crop;
    (4) Multiplying the producer's approved yield by the result of 
(b)(3);
    (5) Multiplying the result of (b)(4) by the approved prevented 
planting payment factor in accordance with Sec. 1437.5(c); and
    (6) Multiplying the result of (b)(5) by:
    (i) For the 1996 through 1998 crop years, 60 percent of the average 
market price, as determined by CCC, or any comparable coverage, as 
determined by CCC; or
    (ii) For the 1999 and subsequent years, 55 percent of the average 
market price, as determined by CCC, or any comparable coverage, as 
determined by CCC.
    (c) The producer has sustained a loss of forage determined by CCC to 
be predominantly grazed in accordance with Sec. 1437.7(l), in excess of 
50 percent of the producer's expected Animal Unit Day established for 
the unit, the NAP payment will be determined by:
    (1) Dividing the unit acreage for each species or type or variety 
identified on

[[Page 430]]

the unit by the approved carrying capacity and multiplying the result by 
the corresponding grazing days used as the basis for determination of 
the carrying capacity, totaling the result for each species or types and 
varieties.
    (2) Multiplying the result of paragraph (c)(1) of this section by 50 
percent.
    (3) Multiplying the number of animals grazed by the daily allowance 
of corn according to type and weight range and divide the result by 
pounds of corn CCC determines is necessary to provide the daily energy 
requirement for one animal unit.
    (4) Multiplying the result of paragraph (c)(3) of this section by 
the number of days grazing occurred to determine gross actual AUD.
    (5) Adding AUD for ineligible causes of loss and incidental 
mechanically harvested Category 1 forage to the result of paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section.
    (6) Subtracting AUD or equivalent value of supplemental feed fed to 
the grazing livestock during the crop year from the result of paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section.
    (7) Subtracting the result of paragraph (c)(6) of this section from 
the result of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If a zero or negative 
number results, payment cannot be calculated.
    (8) Multiplying the positive result of paragraph (c)(7) of this 
section by:
    (i) For the 1997 through 1998 crop years, 60 percent of the average 
market price, as determined by CCC, or any comparable coverage, as 
determined by CCC; or
    (ii) For the 1999 and subsequent years, 55 percent of the average 
market price, as determined by CCC, or any comparable coverage, as 
determined by CCC.

benefits under any other program administered by the Secretary for the 
same crop loss, the producer must choose whether to receive the other 
program benefits or payments under this part. The producer is not 
eligible for both. Such election does not relieve the producer from the 
requirements of making a production and acreage report. However, if the 
other USDA program benefits are not available until after an application 
for benefits has been filed under this part, the producer may refund the 
total amount of the payment to the local office from which the payment

Sec. 1439.1  General statement.

    The regulations in this part set forth the terms and conditions of 
the programs which may be made available to eligible owners for 1990 and 
subsequent livestock feed crop year disasters. The objective of these 
programs is to provide emergency feed assistance to eligible livestock 
owners in a State, county, or area approved by the Executive Vice 
President, CCC, where because of disease, insect infestation, flood, 
drought, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm, hot weather, or other 
natural disaster, a livestock emergency exists. These programs, except 
the Crash Feed Grain Donation Program, also provide feed assistance to 
eligible livestock owners for the preservation and maintenance of 
livestock in any county contiguous to a county where a livestock feed 
emergency has been determined to exist at any time during an 8-month 
period beginning on the date that such an emergency has been determined 
to exist in the other county. The program or programs which are made 
available in the event of the occurrence of a livestock feed emergency 
shall be determined by the Executive Vice President, CCC. With the 
exception of the Prickly Pear Cactus Burning Program and Crash Feed 
Grain Donation Program contained at Sec. 1439.401 through Sec. 1439.504

Sec. 1439.4  Program availability.

    (a) Whenever the Governor of a State determines that a livestock 
feed emergency due to a natural disaster exists in a State, or an area 
of the State, or a county committee determines that such an emergency 
exists in the county or area within the county, the Governor or the 
county committee may submit a request for a determination by the 
Secretary of a livestock feed emergency in the State, county, or area 
thereof and for emergency livestock feed assistance under this part. Any 
request for a determination that a livestock emergency exists because of 
a slow developing natural disaster such as a drought must be submitted 
by October 31 of the current crop year. A determination that a livestock 
emergency due to natural disaster exists may also be made for a State, 
county or area thereof by the Secretary, whether or not a request for 
assistance is submitted. The request of a Governor or county committee 
for a livestock feed emergency determination and for emergency livestock 
feed assistance shall include recommendations to the Secretary of those 
options that will fully use feed available through local sources. The 
request of the Governor must specify the names of the counties for which 
assistance is requested. The request submitted by a county committee for 
a livestock feed emergency determination must be submitted to the State 
committee and must contain:
    (1) A County Feed Loss Assessment Report, Form CCC-654;
    (2) The rainfall data by month expressed in inches and percent of 
normal for the current calendar year and the two previous calendar years 
if the request is due to the occurrence of drought or excess moisture;
    (3) The type of assistance requested; and

[[Page 439]]

    (4) A report of an on-site visit by the county committee and a State 
committee representative stating existing production conditions.
    (b) The State committee shall forward such a request with a 
recommendation of whether the request should be approved to DASCO.
    (c) The Executive Vice President, CCC, or his designee shall make a 
final determination as to whether a livestock feed emergency exists not 
later than 30 days after receipt of any request made in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section and shall notify the Governor or the 
county committee of such determination as applicable and the livestock 
feed programs authorized to be implemented.
    (d) Owners in any county contiguous to a county that has been 
designated as a livestock feed emergency county shall be eligible to 
receive emergency livestock feed assistance under this part, except for 
the Crash Feed Grain Donation Program and Livestock Feed Donation 
Program, at any time during the 8-month period beginning on the date on 
which the emergency was determined exists in the other county.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.5  Owner eligibility.

    Subject to the terms and conditions in this part, an owner, 
including an Indian tribal member owner who is participating in the 
Indian Acute Distress Donation Program (IADDP), may be approved to 
participate in a program established in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.6  Eligibility for assistance.

    (a) Any owner of livestock may file a CCC-652 for participation in a 
program made available by CCC in an approved county. When a CCC-652 is 
filed, the owner or, a duly authorized representative of the owner, 
shall execute the certification contained on the CCC-652.
    (b) The owner, or duly authorized representative of the owner, shall 
enter into a contract with CCC to receive assistance not to exceed the 
amount of eligibility determined on the CCC-653.
    (c) A CCC-652 application worksheet and CCC-651 contract must be 
filed at the county FSA office in an approved county or in a county FSA 
office in a contiguous county.
    (d)(1) The owner, or a duly authorized representative of an owner, 
shall:
    (i) Furnish all the information specified on the CCC-652 and CCC-
651;
    (ii) Certify that the owner meets the requirements of the applicable 
program; and
    (iii) Provide any other information which the approving official 
determines to be necessary to determine the owner's eligibility.
    (2) Applications for assistance due to production losses because of 
a livestock feed emergency determined to exist for 1990 and subsequent 
livestock feed crop year disasters must be filed by December 31 of the 
year in which the disaster occurred.
    (3) With respect to owners in a county contiguous to a county where 
a livestock feed emergency has been determined to exist, owners must 
file not later than the last day of the 8-month period beginning on the 
day the Secretary of Agriculture determines that a livestock feed 
emergency exists in the other county.
    (e)(1) With respect to those programs which require that an eligible 
livestock owner must have suffered a substantial loss of production of 
feed, in determining whether a substantial loss of production of feed 
exists, the normal production of livestock feed and the current year 
livestock feed production harvested by the owner shall be converted to a 
monetary value based on established crop yields or the 5-year average 
yield of the crop excluding the high and low years, obtained from the 
National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS). The amount of loss of 
livestock feed production shall be determined by CCC by comparing the 
monetary value of normal feed production produced on the owner's 
landholdings including leased land and any other land which is available 
for use by the owner to the monetary value of the actual livestock feed 
production harvested from such holdings. Loss of pasture production 
shall be based on the grazing value per acre of such pasture and the 
percent of loss for such acres. The owner must have suffered a 
substantial monetary value loss of feed normally produced by the owner 
to be eligible to participate in the emergency livestock feed programs.

[[Page 440]]

    (2) A substantial loss of production may, as determined by CCC, 
include feed stocks produced in the current crop year which were damaged 
or destroyed by a natural disaster while in storage. Feed stocks not 
totally destroyed shall be appraised by CCC on the basis of the 
remaining value of such stocks as livestock feed.
    (3) For the 1990 emergency livestock feed program the determination 
of a substantial loss of production with respect to pasture, range, or 
other grazing land shall be computed based on the loss of current year 
grazing after the beginning of the livestock feed program crop year 
through the end of the feeding period. County ASC committees shall 
establish a value per acre for each type of grazing for the county and 
the maximum degree of loss for each type of grazing. Any production loss 
attributed to overgrazing in a prior crop year shall be excluded.
    (4) For the 1991 and subsequent emergency livestock feed program 
crop years, the determination of a substantial loss of production with 
respect to pasture, range, or other grazing land shall be computed based 
on the loss of current year grazing after the beginning of the livestock 
feed program crop year through the end of the feeding period. State ASC 
committees shall establish a carrying capacity for each type of grazing 
in the county. The normal grazing value will be based on the carrying 
capacity and the dollar value of the quantity of forage needed to 
maintain an animal unit for 1 day, as determined by DASCO.
    (5) In determining a substantial loss of production with respect to 
feed grain, silage, green chop, hay, and other roughage, the current 
crop year acreage and normal yields for such crops shall be used. The 
owner with swine, poultry or fish and grazing livestock that selects to 
include only eligible livestock that do not normally graze or use forage 
in the application for assistance shall not receive a loss on roughage, 
grazing, or other crops not suitable for non-grazing livestock.
    (6) The amount of payment on any loss of production otherwise 
computed shall be reduced due to the receipt of other government 
disaster benefits which are received by the person for livestock feed 
normally grown by the owner. No reduction shall be made for CCC-owned 
grain that is donated to eligible Indian livestock owners under the 
Indian Acute Distress Donation Program (IADDP).
    (7) No loss of production shall be determined on acreage 
conservation reserve (ACR) or conserving use (CU) for payment acreage 
during the 5-month restricted haying and grazing period established by 
the State committee for purpose of administering part 1413 of this 
chapter.
    (f) The same monetary value per ton, bushel or hundredweight, as 
applicable, used to determine the value for normal production and feed 
production harvested shall be used to determine a monetary value for 
feed available.
    (g) Current year feed available owned by the owner of eligible 
livestock on the date of application shall include, but is not limited 
to:
    (1) Feed grain, silage, green chop, hay, pasture, and other 
roughage;
    (2) Current crop year production of feed still available including 
any grain pledged as collateral for a CCC price support loan;
    (3) Current crop year feed grain pledged as collateral for a CCC 
price support loan during the current crop year.
    (4) Any current crop year feed that is sold during the current crop 
year by considering the date of delivery of the feed as the date sold;
    (5) Pasture, range, or other grazing land owned by the owner and any 
benefits from any pasture or grazing rights purchased or leased as part 
of the owner's normal operation during the feeding period;
    (6) Grazing benefits from hay or grain crops which are grazed 
instead of or in addition to harvesting during the feeding period, 
including any temporary grazing of crops such as wheat;
    (7) Temporary winter cover crops available for grazing during the 
feeding period;
    (8) Any current year feed produced by the owner utilized in a 
feedlot for the commercial feeding of livestock;
    (9) Any donated feed received during the current year including 
current and prior years production, that is still available on the date 
the application is

[[Page 441]]

filed except for feed grain donated by CCC under the IADDP;
    (10) Any roughage or grazing value available during the feeding 
period from ACR or CU during the 7-month nonrestricted haying and 
grazing period established by the State committee for purposes of 
administering part 1413 of this chapter;
    (11) If haying or grazing of ACR or CU for payment acreage during 
the 5-month restricted period is authorized, any roughage or grazing 
value available from these acreages during the feeding period; and
    (12) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any other feed

(12) of this section, less the monetary value, as determined by DASCO, 
of any donated grain received under IADDP.
    (i)(1)(i) The value of total feed needs determined with respect to 
an owner of livestock, other than fish for food, shall not exceed the

monetary value of feed available including feed grain, hay, silage, 
pasture and range, and any other source of feed, determined by the 
approving official to be available to the owner for feeding eligible 
livestock during the feeding period.
    (iv) The amount of total benefits available determined with respect 
to an owner for the entire feeding period shall be a percentage, as 
determined by DASCO, of the smaller of the monetary value of additional 
feed needs or the monetary value of feed production loss by the owner.
    (2) The value of feed needs determined with respect to an owner of 
fish for food shall not exceed the average pounds of fish owned by the 
owner times the number of days in the feeding period times one percent

Sec. 1439.7  Adjustment of total benefits available.

    (a)(1) The determination of the total benefits available to the 
owner may be decreased or increased after a determination has been made. 
The contact person shall notify all other owners which are a party to 
the CCC-652 and CCC-651 of all changes regarding the application and 
contract.
    (2) If there is an increase or a reduction in the number of the 
owner's eligible livestock, this fact shall be promptly reported to the 
approving official. If necessary an adjustment in the owner's additional 
feed needs and an adjustment in the benefits issued to the owner shall 
be made. This increase or reduction shall be made by revising the 
benefits available on the CCC-653 and CCC-651 by the result of 
multiplying the amount of the change in eligible animals, times the 
number of days remaining in the feeding period times the cost per day to 
provide energy requirements for the applicable weight range by type of 
eligible livestock. After adjusting the benefits available, if 
applicable, the county office shall notify the contact person of the 
current total benefits available.
    (3) If, due to a change in total benefits available, an excess 
amount of assistance was provided to the owner, the owner must refund 
such excess including applicable interest as determined by DASCO.
    (b) If additional feed, including pasture, becomes available to the 
owner from production on any land included in the owner's holdings 
covered by the contract during a feeding period, this fact shall be 
promptly reported to the county office and proper adjustments shall be 
made.
    (c) If any decrease in feed production, including pasture, occurs on 
any land included in the owner's holdings covered by the contract during 
a feeding period, this fact shall be promptly reported to the county 
office and proper adjustments shall be made.

Sec. 1439.8  Disposition of feed.

    (a)(1) Feed grain or other livestock feed obtained under this part 
shall not be exchanged for any ingredients, services, cash, credit, or 
any other thing of value.
    (2) An owner may feed eligible livestock feed to any livestock owned 
or leased, after a determination has been made that the owner's eligible 
livestock were the only livestock used in determining the owner's total 
benefits available.
    (b) The total quantity of feed purchased in accordance with this 
part, for which CCC has provided assistance under contract with the 
owner, must be fed to the owner's livestock within the feeding period. 
The county committee may consider livestock feed as having been fed 
within the feeding period if the county committee determines that 
failure to timely feed the livestock feed was due to conditions beyond 
the control of the owner. The amount of livestock feed remaining which 
may be considered as being timely fed shall not exceed a 10-day supply 
of feed for the owner's eligible livestock.
    (c)(1) If the owner does not feed the feed grain or other livestock 
feed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, with respect 
to the unfed amount the owner shall pay to CCC the following amounts 
plus any applicable interest, as determined by CCC:
    (i) With respect to purchased CCC-owned feed grain, the difference 
between the price paid for such feed grain and the Posted County Price 
(PCP) used to determine the dollar amount paid by the owner thereof, or 
such other value as determined by CCC, based on the price of such feed 
grain in the county where the feed grain was stored; and

[[Page 443]]

    (ii) With respect to cost-share assistance, the amount of assistance 
received; and
    (iii) With respect to CCC-owned feed grain donated to the owner, the 
rate equal to the PCP of the feed grain in the county where the grain

livestock owner.
    (2) If the owner has failed to report a change in the livestock 
operation of the owner as required by this subpart and excess assistance 
was provided to the owner, the owner shall pay to CCC the following 
amounts plus any applicable interest, as determined by CCC:
    (i) With respect to purchased CCC-owned feed grain, the difference 
determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for any benefits 
received by the owner under the terms of the contract for the purchase 
of such feed grains which was purchased in excess of the quantity that 
CCC would have approved on the contract and made available, if such 
report had been made.
    (ii) With respect to cost-share assistance, the amount of cost-share 
assistance which was received under the terms of the contract, as 
determined by CCC, based on the amount in excess of the amount that CCC 
would have approved on the contract if such report had been made.
    (iii) With respect to CCC-owned feed grain donated to the owner, the 
rate equal to the PCP of the feed grain in the county where the grain 
was stored, on the date the feed grain was made available to the 
livestock owner.

    (a) The total amount of payments which are made by CCC to all 
persons under the contract shall be the amount equal to the total

Such amount shall be paid by CCC only if it has been determined that the 
persons are eligible to receive such benefits according to the terms and 
conditions of the regulations and the contract. The county office shall 
provide a percentage of the total amount of benefit due upon approval of 
the owner's application for benefits and acceptance of the contract as 
determined by DASCO. The remainder of the total amount of benefits due 
if any will be made after the owner has shown that the terms and 
conditions of the contract have been met. If any terms, conditions, or 
requirements of the regulations and the contract are not met, payments 
and benefits previously provided by CCC which were not earned under the 
provisions of the contract shall be refunded.
    (b) At any time during the period of the contract, the owner shall, 
as requested by the county committee, submit to the county office, 
receipts and sales documents that are required verifying that the owner 
purchased the necessary feed to feed the livestock under the terms and 
conditions of the contract.
    (c) Any receipts or sales documents that may be required of the 
owner by CCC showing that the terms of the contract have been met must 
be submitted by the owner by not later than the tenth working day after 
the end of the feeding period on the contract or addendum.

indicated on the contract, and each person shall receive benefits or 
final payment from CCC according to benefits or payments earned under 
the provisions of the contract.

period relating to a crop year shall execute a contract for each 
subsequent feeding period for which the owner is eligible. CCC shall 
provide assistance equal to the amount of benefits determined for the 
owner for the feeding periods that the owner is eligible to receive 
benefits.
    (f) The failure of any contact person to file the necessary receipts 
or sales documents showing that the terms and conditions of this part 
and the contract have been met shall render all of the persons 
ineligible for any payments and benefits under the contract including 
any payments previously made. Payments made shall be refunded to CCC 
with interest, if applicable, as determined under Sec. 1439.17 of this 
subpart.
    (g) Any payments or benefits, as determined under Sec. 1439.17 of

[[Page 444]]

if the owner does not submit receipts or sales documents to CCC for 
purchases of feed not later than the tenth working day after the end of 
each feeding period on the contract.
    (h) The failure of a livestock owner to comply with regulations and 
contract terms regarding changes that may affect the owner's eligibility 
shall be a violation of the program and shall render the owner 
ineligible to receive program benefits. However, in the event the 
provisions of part 791 of this title are applicable to a specific 
violation, the owner may receive benefits under the program, reduced as 
follows:
    (1) For the owner's first such violation, total benefits available

651-B or CCC-651, as applicable.
    (4) For the owner's fourth such violation, the owner shall be

<R05>
Sec. 1439.101  General statement.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions of the 
Livestock Preservation Donation Program. This program shall only be in 
effect upon a determination that a livestock feed emergency exists in a 
State, county or area and it has been announced that this program is in 
effect. Information regarding the availability of the program in a 
county may be obtained from State and county offices.
    (b) In order to be eligible to participate in the program, an owner 
of livestock must have suffered a substantial loss of production of feed 
as defined in Sec. 1439.3 of this part. The objective of the program is 
to provide assistance approved by CCC through a contract with the owner, 
for the owner to receive donated CCC-owned feed grains, for livestock 
owners who are financially unable to purchase feed, or to otherwise 
participate in any other program authorized under this part. The owner 
must establish to the satisfaction of the approving official that:
    (1) Without assistance the owner's livestock would perish or be sold 
at distress prices; and
    (2) The owner has insufficient cash or credit to buy feed for 
eligible livestock.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.102  Eligibility.

    (a) A livestock owner may be approved to participate in the program 
if it is determined that in addition to the provisions of Secs. 1439.1 
through 1439.24 that:
    (1) The livestock owner's need for replacing and repairing losses of 
buildings, equipment, suppliers, and other related matters will leave 
insufficient cash or credit to buy feed for livestock;
    (2) The livestock owner has insufficient cash or credit to buy feed 
for eligible livestock;
    (3) The owner's livestock would perish or be sold at distress prices 
without donation of feed grains under this program;
    (4) The livestock owner does not have sufficient livestock feed to 
feed the livestock through the period of the emergency; and
    (5) The livestock owner is unable to participate in any other 
emergency livestock feed program which is currently in effect in 
accordance with this part.
    (b) With respect to the determinations made in accordance with 
paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section, the approving official 
must determine that under prevailing local conditions the owner's 
financial resources preclude the owner from obtaining sufficient 
quantities of feed from normal suppliers without:
    (1) Imperiling continuance of the farming operations;
    (2) Placing the owner in default with respect to existing financial 
obligations;
    (3) Causing the owner to engage in unsound borrowing practices; or
    (4) Resulting in excessive disposal of livestock by the owner.
    (c) Purchased feed shall be considered as an available asset in 
determining whether an owner is suffering an undue financial hardship. 
In making this determination, the approving official shall take into 
consideration the normal financial resources of owners in the area. If 
the owner meets the conditions as provided in Sec. 1439.10 of this part, 
the resources of the owner and all of the related persons shall be taken 
into consideration in determining the eligibility of the owner to 
receive assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.103  Assistance.

    (a) The livestock owner shall establish that the livestock owner's 
operation has been so damaged by the disaster that sufficient cash or 
credit does not exist which may be used to purchase necessary feed grain 
at present market prices. The owner shall not sell or dispose of in any 
way, except by feeding to the owner's livestock, CCC-

[[Page 448]]

donated feed grain. The owner shall reimburse CCC at a rate equal to the 
PCP of the feed grain in the county where the feed grain was stored, on 
the date the feed grain was made available to the livestock owner for 
any CCC-donated grain which is on hand after the end of the emergency 
period that exceeds a 10-day supply.
    (b) CCC shall designate the kind of CCC-owned feed grain to be 
donated under this program and the delivery point at which such feed 
grain shall be made available. The delivery point may be in the eligible 
designated county, contiguous county, or any other location as 
designated by CCC. In those instances where feed grain is not available 
in the eligible designated county, or contiguous county, CCC may 
reimburse the livestock owner for the cost of transportation of the feed 
grain at a rate determined by DASCO.
    (c) Transportation assistance will be provided to owners based on 
the smaller of the following:
    (1) The loaded mileage from the delivery point where the feed grain 
is made available to the county line of the county in which the 
livestock owner is located; or
    (2) When the owner delivers grain to a feed dealer for processing, 
the loaded mileage from the delivery point where the feed grain is made 
available to such feed dealer's facility.
    (d) The maximum quantity of CCC-donated feed grain made available to 
an owner under this subpart shall be limited to the quantity determined 
by CCC in accordance with Sec. 1439.6 of this part based on the cost of 
CCC-owned feed grain purchased in accordance with Sec. 1439.202(h) of 
this part.

as defined in Sec. 1439.3 of this part. The objective of the program is 
to provide livestock owners with the option to purchase a quantity of 
CCC-owned grain, not to exceed the owner's eligibility as stated on the 
contract at a reduced price. An owner who elects to purchase CCC-owned 
feed grain will have the monetary value on the application reduced by 
the result of multiplying the amount of CCC-owned grain purchased times 
an amount determined by DASCO.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.202  Sale of CCC-owned grain.

    (a) CCC shall designate the kind of CCC-owned feed grain to be sold 
under this program and the delivery point at which such feed grain may 
be made available. The delivery point may be in the eligible county, 
contiguous county, or any other locations as designated by CCC. In those 
instances where feed grain is not available in the eligible county or 
contiguous county, CCC may reimburse the owner for transportation on the 
smaller of:
    (1) The loaded mileage from the delivery point where the feed grain 
is made available to the county line of the county in which the 
livestock owner is located; or
    (2) When the owner delivers grain to a feed dealer for processing, 
the loaded mileage from the delivery point where the feed grain is made 
available to such feed dealer's facility.
    (b) Sales of CCC-owned grain may be made in a quantity which does 
not exceed the quantity determined by CCC in accordance with Sec. 1439.6 
of this part based on a cost provided for in paragraph (h) of this 
subpart, which will permit feeding of grain to eligible livestock by the 
owner by the end of the feeding period.
    (c) After payment is received by CCC, delivery shall be authorized 
by issuance of nontransferable delivery

[[Page 449]]

orders by CCC stating the kind and quantity of grain to be delivered and 
the expiration date in accordance with instructions issued by DASCO. 
Quantities authorized by delivery orders shall not exceed the quantity 
of grain determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The owner shall take physical delivery of the grain as soon as 
possible after issuance of the delivery order but not earlier than the 
date of such issuance and not later than a date determined by DASCO 
which would normally permit feeding of the grain as specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section. Title and risk of loss to the grain 
specified in the delivery order and stored at a warehouse or handler's 
facility shall pass to the owner when the owner accepts the grain and 
the owner and warehouseman certify on the delivery order. The owner 
shall promptly present the delivery order to the warehouseman or 
handler. CCC shall not be responsible for storage charges after the 
title passes to the owner but shall be responsible for handling charges 
at a rate not to exceed the rate provided in CCC's agreement with the 
warehouse or the handler. In cases where there is an underdelivery in 
quantity of the eligible grain, the owner shall not make settlement with 
the warehouse or handler but shall promptly notify the county office 
which issued the delivery order and a revised delivery order will be 
issued to the owner or a refund of the value of underdelivered feed 
grain will be made to the owner. Differences in quality between the 
grain accepted by the owner and the grain described in the loading order 
issued to the warehouseman or handler by CCC shall be settled between 
the warehouseman or handler and the owner.
    (e)(1) Where CCC-owned feed grain is not available in an area in 
which an eligible county is located and there are no CCC-approved 
warehouses or handlers in such area, CCC may ship the required quantity 
of feed grain to the area and consign such grain to the county 
committee. Title and risk of loss shall pass to the owner upon delivery 
of the feed grain into the owner's conveyance or whenever the owner 
takes possession of the feed grain if such possession occurs prior to 
placing the feed grain in such conveyance.
    (2) The sale price shall not be subject to adjustment for the grade 
and quality actually delivered into the owner's conveyance.
    (3) The feed grain shall be weighed at destination if scales 
approved by CCC are available. If such scales are not available, 
settlement weights shall be as determined by CCC.
    (4) CCC shall bear charges for transportation to the delivery point, 
for unloading the feed grain from the carrier's conveyance, for loading 
the feed grain into the owner's conveyance, and for determining the 
weight of the feed grain.
    (f)(1) An owner may elect to receive eligible feed grain under the 
provisions of this subpart from feed grain stored on the livestock 
owner's farm if such grain has been pledged as collateral for a farm-
stored CCC price support loan. Payment for such feed grain shall be made 
to CCC at the county office where the livestock feed programs 
application was filed. Feed grain acquired by the owner shall not be 
exchanged for any ingredient, service, cash, credit, or any other thing 
of value.
    (2) An owner may elect to receive eligible feed grain under the 
provisions of this section through a feed dealer provided the owner 
executes a power of attorney as provided on Form ASCS-211, authorizing 
the feed dealer to execute the delivery order on behalf of the owner. 
Payment for feed grain shall be made to CCC at the county office where 
the application for feed grain is filed when requesting the delivery 
order. Feed grain purchased by a feed dealer on behalf of the owner 
shall not be exchanged for any ingredient, service, cash, credit, or any 
other thing of value.
    (3) The feed dealer shall provide such county office, in writing, 
the names of agents, such as company representatives, authorized to sign 
the delivery order on behalf of the feed dealer at the time of delivery 
of feed grain. The feed dealer shall:
    (i) Take delivery of the feed grain before the expiration date of 
the delivery order;

[[Page 450]]

    (ii) Take physical delivery of the feed grain at each warehouse 
where the feed grain is located;
    (iii) Not be reimbursed for transportation of feed grain received on 
behalf of the applicant; and
    (iv) Present to such county office a statement signed by the owner 
and feed dealer certifying that the processed feed contained feed grain 
in the same quantity, type, and same or better grade as purchased by the 
owner.
    (g) An owner who desires to have grain pelletized, ground, rolled, 
custom mixed, or otherwise processed may do so if the feed is processed 
from the feed grain purchased from CCC or the feed accepted from the 
processor is processed from the same kind of feed grain stated on the 
delivery order which grades the same or better as compared to such feed 
grain. The quantity of feed grain processed by the processor and 
delivered to the owner shall be the same quantity as the feed grain 
purchased from CCC, except for minor milling losses. CCC shall not be 
responsible for any charges involving processing, bagging, added freight 
incurred for processing in transit or any other cost which is incurred 
which would not have been incurred except for the processing of such 
feed grain.
    (h) The sales price of eligible feed grain made available by CCC in 
response to any livestock feed emergency determined to exist shall be;
    (1) For grain purchased from CCC-owned inventory, 50 percent of the 
PCP; and
    (2) For grain purchased by the owner which had previously been 
pledged as collateral for such owner's farm-stored price support loan, 
50 percent of the ajdusted CCC value as determined by CCC on the date 
the payment is received in the county in which the feed grain is stored.
    (3) If no such PCP is established, the sales price shall be 
established at a comparable rate in accordance with instructions issued 
by DASCO.
    (i) The quantity of feed grain delivered to an owner shall not 
exceed the total quantity approved for sale by CCC by more than 5 
percent. Differences in quantity between the grain delivered to the 
owner and the quantity of grain described in the delivery order issued 
to the warehouseman or handler that was removed from the delivery point 
in excess of 105 percent shall be considered as open stocks and shall be 
settled between the livestock owner and the warehouseman or handler. 
Differences in quantity between the grain delivered to the livestock 
owner and the quantity of feed grain described in the delivery order 
issued to the warehouseman or handler between 100 and 105 percent shall 
be paid by the owner to CCC at 50 percent of the PCP determined by CCC 
for the commodity in the county in which the feed grain is stored.
    (j) An amount equal to the purchase price times the quantity not 
delivered to the owner shall be refunded to the owner in those cases in 
which the total approved quantity shown on the delivery order and paid 
for by the owner is not delivered to the owner.
    (k) When an owner desires to purchase feed grain pursuant to an 
approved application and contract, the owner must make a payment to CCC, 
in the manner specified in instructions issued by DASCO with respect to 
the quantity of grain to be purchased prior to issuance of a delivery 
order for such feed grain. The county committee may waive such prior 
payment requirement if a State or Federal agency certifies to CCC that 
such agency will finance part or all of the cost of the purchase. If 
such agency agrees to make payment directly to CCC as specified by the 
county committee, such a certification may be accepted by the county 
committee in lieu of cash to the extent of the amount so certified.

<R05>
Sec. 1439.901  Applicability.

    This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions of a government-to-
government program titled the American Indian Livestock Feed Program 
(AILFP). The AILFP has been allocated a budget of $12.5 million. 
Assistance will be available in those regions that Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) determines have been affected by natural disaster, and 
where a determination is made by the Deputy Administrator for Farm 
Programs that a livestock feed emergency exists on tribal land. Funds 
made available under the AILFP shall be available beginning in crop year 
1997 and subsequent crop years. Payments may become available as 
contracts with tribal governments are approved. If any other benefits 
are received from the Department of Agriculture for the same loss, then 
payments under this part will be reduced accordingly. Payments will 
terminate when funds have been exhausted, without respect to the date of 
any application, or of when any contract has been entered into by any 
tribal government and CCC. Applicants will receive benefits on a first 
come, first served basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1439.902  Administration.

    (a) This subpart shall be administered by CCC under the general

in cases where the applicant or tribe, as applicable, show that 
circumstances beyond the applicant's or tribe's control precluded 
compliance with the deadline and where lateness or failure to meet such 
other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the 
program.
    (e) The tribal government will, in accordance with this part and in 
coordination with the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (BIA) and FSA State and county committees, recommend the 
geographical size and shape of the region where the natural disaster has 
occurred, and whether the regional eligibility requirement has been 
satisfied. Documentation to support the reported natural disaster shall 
be provided by the FSA State office and shall accompany the 
recommendation. The recommendation of eligibility must be acted on by 
the Deputy Administrator.
    (f) The Deputy Administrator will determine all prices with respect 
to implementing the AILFP.
    (g) The FSA State committee will determine crop yields and livestock 
carrying capacity with respect to implementing the AILFP.
    (h) Participation in the AILFP by a tribal government for either the 
tribal government's benefits or for the benefit of any eligible owner is 
voluntary and is with the understanding that CCC

Sec. 1446.201  General handler provisions.

    (a) Handler registration and approval. To avoid marketing penalties 
otherwise provided in this part for failure to register as a handler, 
each person who plans to acquire peanuts for processing or resale must 
register as a handler and be approved as a handler in accordance with 
this paragraph.
    (1) Registration. Registration must be made on the form ASCS-1008, 
Application for Handler Card, and must be filed:
    (i) For each marketing year in which such person expects to acquire 
peanuts for processing or resale.
    (ii) With each marketing association that serves the marketing area 
in which such person plans to acquire peanuts during the applicable 
marketing year.
    (iii) Prior to the time such person acquires peanuts, during the 
respective marketing year, within the marketing area served by such 
marketing association.
    (2) Approval. The determination of whether a handler will be 
approved

[[Page 471]]

shall be made by the applicable marketing association in which the 
registration was filed and, in the case of approval, such approval shall 
be evidenced by a handler registration number that is issued by such 
marketing association.
    (b) Handler of loan peanuts. To handle loan peanuts, either quota or 
additional, a person must be approved as a handler and must contract 
with the marketing association on form CCC-1028 or form CCC-1028-A to 
handle such peanuts. To contract to handle loan peanuts, the handler 
must meet all requirements of the applicable warehousing contract with 
respect to receiving, handling and storing loan peanuts.

against handlers. Further, such handler shall be subject to penalties 
for non-registration as may apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.202  Peanut buyer card and buying point card.

    (a) Peanut buyer card. The marketing association which approves a 
handler will assign a registration number to such handler and CCC will 
issue an embossed peanut buyer card which will show the handler's 
registration number, name and address. The handler will use the buyer 
card for identification when buying or selling peanuts.
    (b) Buying point card. CCC will issue a buying point card to the 
Federal-State Inspection Service for delivery to each handler who 
operates a buying point at which peanuts are inspected. The buying point 
card will show a buying point number that will be used to identify the 
physical location of such buying point.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.203  Marketing card entries and collection of assessments, penalties and debts.

    The handler shall make marketing card entries and shall collect 
assessments, penalties and debts in accordance with the provisions in 
this part and in part 729 of this title.
    (a) Indebtedness to the United States due to peanut marketing 
penalties. As provided in part 729 of this title, if a producer is 
indebted to the United States for a peanut marketing penalty, such 
penalty shall result in a lien in favor of the United States on any 
peanuts in which such producer has an interest and any person who 
acquires peanuts from such producer shall be considered to have notice 
of such lien at the time such lien becomes attached. Except with respect 
to any lien that was perfected before the peanut poundage quota lien 
became attached in those cases not involving peanuts placed in the price 
support loan inventory, any person who acquires peanuts from such 
producer shall deduct the lien amount plus any applicable interest from 
the proceeds otherwise due to such producer as a result of the 
acquisition of the peanuts. Any deducted amount shall be paid to CCC in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator. In the 
event a required deduction is not made from the proceeds for such 
peanuts, the person who acquires such peanuts shall be liable to CCC for 
the amount of the lien, to the extent of the market value of such 
peanuts or proceeds of the peanuts whichever is higher.
    (b) Farmers Home Administration or Farm Service Agency lien. If a 
Farmers Home Administration or Farm Service Agency lien has been 
recorded on the marketing card that was issued for the use of a producer 
when marketing peanuts, the purchaser of such peanuts shall make the 
check, for the proceeds from such peanuts, payable jointly to the 
producer and the Farm Service Agency. However, if a peanut poundage 
quota lien was also recorded on the marketing card against such 
producer,

[[Page 472]]

the check shall be made payable jointly to the producer, CCC and the 
Farm Service Agency.

collected directly or indirectly from a producer at the time such 
producer marketed peanuts as quota commercial or contract additional 
peanuts. Such collections shall be made in accordance with the 
requirements of part 729 of this title. A collection is considered to 
have been made at the time of marketing the peanuts. Each collection 
shall be sent to the county FSA office which issued the marketing card 
and, unless otherwise approved by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
shall be sent within 15 days after the collection is made.
    (b) Loan peanuts. Withholdings from the loan value due a producer 
which represent collections of marketing penalties, peanut poundage 
quota liens or U.S. claims shall be transmitted or handled in accordance

such peanuts for crushing or exportation.
    (c) Interest due. A producer who pledges peanuts as collateral for a

peanuts are pledged for the loan, it is brought to the attention of the 
marketing association that such person is not an eligible producer. 
Interest shall be due:
    (1) At the same interest rate that was applicable on funds borrowed 
from CCC by the marketing association on the date the loan was 
disbursed.
    (2) From the date the loan was disbursed to the date of repayment.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.306  Commingling of peanuts.

    To facilitate handling and marketing, unless prohibited by a 
handler's storage contract with the marketing association, a handler may 
store farmers stock loan peanuts on a commingled basis with peanuts 
owned by such handler if such peanuts are of like crop, type, area, and 
segregation.
    (a) Accounting for commingled peanuts. Except for peanuts purchased 
from CCC for domestic edible use on an in-grade and in-weight basis, 
commingled peanuts shall be exchanged on a dollar value basis. 
Accordingly, when loan peanuts are removed from the warehouse they must 
be inspected as farmers stock peanuts by an inspector and accounted for 
on a dollar value, based on the quota loan rate, less a one-time 
adjustment for shrinkage for each crop.
    (b) Dollar value shrinkage adjustment. For peanuts that are graded 
out and accounted for:
    (1) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (i) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (ii) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.
    (2) After January 31 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (i) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and

maintain a copy of each form ASCS-1007 that was issued for any peanuts 
that are placed in commingled storage and that is issued for any peanuts 
removed from storage.
    (d) Good commercial practice. The handler shall receive, store and 
deliver all such peanuts in accordance with good commercial practice and 
any instructions provided by CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.307  Disaster transfer of Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 peanuts from additional loan to quota loan.

    (a) Transfer of Segregation 2 and Segregation 3 peanuts. Except as 
otherwise provided in this section, after a producer has completed 
marketing all peanuts produced on the farm, such producer may transfer a 
loan on Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 additional peanuts to a quota 
loan.
    (b) Limitation of amount eligible for transfer. A transfer made in 
accordance with this section shall not exceed the smaller of:
    (1) The difference between:
    (i) The total quantity of Segregation 1 peanuts marketed from the 
farm, plus the amount of peanuts retained on the farm for seed or other 
use, and
    (ii) The effective farm poundage quota, excluding quota pounds 
transferred to the farm in the fall; or
    (2) Twenty-five percent of the effective farm poundage quota, 
excluding quota pounds transferred to the farm in the fall.
    (c) Offset of CCC losses. As provided in this part, if a producer 
transfers an additional loan to a quota loan in accordance with the 
provisions of this section, any pool proceeds otherwise due such 
producer from peanuts in another pool shall be reduced by the amount of 
any losses to CCC on the peanuts so transferred.
    (d) Loan value for transferred peanuts--(1) Segregation 2 peanuts. 
The quota loan value for any lot of Segregation 2 peanuts transferred 
from an additional loan to a quota loan shall be determined by 
multiplying 70 percent of the quota loan rate that otherwise would have 
been applicable for such lot of peanuts as quota peanuts, exclusive of 
any discount for damaged kernels, by the net weight of peanuts being 
transferred and deducting from the result the amount of any special 
discount that may apply for Segregation 2 peanuts transferred in 
accordance with this section.
    (2) Segregation 3 peanuts. The quota loan value for any lot of 
Segregation 3 peanuts transferred from an additional loan to a quota 
loan shall be determined by multiplying 70 percent of the quota loan 
rate that otherwise would have been applicable for such lot of peanuts 
as quota peanuts, exclusive of any discount for damaged kernels, by the 
net weight of peanuts being transferred and deducting from the result 
the amount of any special discount that may apply for Segregation 3 
peanuts transferred in accordance with this section.
    (e) Transfer provisions--(1) Where to apply. Producers who are 
eligible to transfer additional loan peanuts to the quota loan pool in 
accordance with the provisions of this section may apply for such 
transfers with the county FSA office.
    (2) Determination of the amount eligible for transfer. The county 
office shall determine, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, the quantity of additional peanuts which are eligible for 
transfer.
    (3) Designation of peanuts to be transferred. The producer must 
indicate to the county office the net weight and applicable form ASCS-
1007 serial numbers for the peanuts to be transferred.
    (4) Applicability of marketings. Any peanuts that are transferred 
from an additional loan to a quota loan shall be considered as 
marketings of quota peanuts and the applicable records shall be 
appropriately adjusted.
    (f) Supplemental loan payment. The difference between the additional 
and quota loan rates for such peanuts, less the appropriate adjustment 
for the marketing assessment, shall be advanced by the marketing 
association to the applicable producer.
    (g) Waiver of right to make transfer. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions in this section, an additional loan on Segregation 2 or 
Segregation 3 peanuts shall not be transferred to a quota loan under 
this section with respect to that

[[Page 476]]

quantity of peanuts for which the producer has executed a waiver of the 
right to make such a transfer in order to obtain indemnity benefits from 
the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation or has agreed to such a waiver 
with any other Federal agency.

    (a) Establishment of pools. (1) Each marketing association shall 
establish six separate loan pools; one for each of the three 
segregations of additional peanuts and one for each of the three 
segregations for quota peanuts. These pools shall be formed without 
regard to the type of peanuts (Runner, Virginia, Spanish, or Valencia) 
involved. However, the SWPGA shall also establish 12 separate loan pools 
for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico, namely, for bright hull 
peanuts and for dark hull peanuts separately, to include for each of 
them separate, by segregation, additional peanuts and quota peanuts 
pools. Each marketing association shall maintain separate, complete and 
accurate records for each loan pool that is established by the marketing 
association.

Except as provided in clause (a)(2)(ii) of this section, in the case of 
the 1996 and subsequent crops, Valencia peanuts not physically produced 
in the State of New Mexico shall not be eligible to participate in the 
pools of the State even if the farm on which the peanuts are produced is 
constituted for administrative purposes within the State of New Mexico.
    (ii) Exception. A producer of Valencia peanuts may enter Valencia 
peanuts that are physically produced in Texas into the pools for New 
Mexico in a quantity not greater than the average annual quantity of the 
peanuts that the producer entered into the New Mexico pools for the 1990 
through 1995 crops; however, to qualify, the peanuts must be produced on 
the same farm on which the peanuts were produced during the base years 
of 1990 through 1995.
    (b) Net gains for quota pools. Net gains from peanuts in each quota 
pool shall consist of the amount by which the proceeds from the sale of 
the peanuts in such pool are in excess of the indebtedness on the 
peanuts in such pool.
    (c) Net gains for additional pool. Net gains for peanuts in each 
additional pool shall consist of:
    (1) The net gains which are in excess of the indebtedness on the 
peanuts placed in such pool; less
    (2) Any amount as provided in paragraph (d) of this section that is 
allocated to offset any loss on the pools for Segregation 1 quota 
peanuts, and any other amount properly offset.
    (d) Recovery of losses in quota area loan pools. (1) If the loan 
indebtedness on the peanuts in a quota area pool exceeds the proceeds 
from the sale of the peanuts in such pool, such excess shall be 
recovered using the following sources in the following order of 
priority:
    (i) Proceeds due any individual producer from any pool, as a result 
of the transfer of peanuts for pricing purposes from an additional loan 
pool to a quota loan pool, pursuant to the provisions in Sec. 1446.307.
    (ii) Gains of any producer in the same pool, by the amount of pool 
gains attributed to the same producer from the sale of additional 
peanuts for domestic and export edible use.
    (iii) Gains or profits resulting from the sale of additional 
peanuts, other than Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico in separate 
type pools established under paragraph (a) of this section, in the same 
marketing area for domestic edible use, that are owned or controlled by 
CCC. This paragraph shall not apply to gains or profits from the sale of 
peanuts that were produced on farms with 1 acre or less of peanut 
production.
    (iv) Marketing assessments, collected from producers under 
Sec. 729.316 of this title, that the Secretary determines are necessary 
to cover losses in area quota pools.
    (v) Gains or profits from quota pools in other marketing areas, 
other than separate type pools established under paragraph (a) of this 
section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico.
    (vi) Gains or profits resulting from the sale of additional peanuts 
in other marketing areas, other than Valencia

[[Page 477]]

peanuts produced in New Mexico in separate type pools established under 
paragraph (a) of this section, for domestic edible use, that are owned 
or controlled by CCC. This paragraph shall not apply to gains or profits 
from the sale of peanuts that were produced on farms with 1 acre or less 
of peanut production.
    (vii) Marketing assessments, collected from handlers under 
Sec. 729.316 of this title, that the Secretary determines are necessary 
to cover losses in area quota pools.
    (viii) Increased marketing assessments on quota peanuts in the 
production area covered by the pool, which shall be assessed as needed 
and collected from producers under Sec. 729.317 of this title.
    (2) The exceptions provided for Valencia peanuts in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section shall only apply as to prevent offsets between pools for 
each of the Valencia types (bright-hull and dark-hull) for New Mexico 
and other peanuts.
    (e) Pool distribution. (1) Net gains as determined in accordance 
with this section on peanuts in each area pool shall be distributed to 
each producer who placed peanuts in that pool in proportion to the 
dollar value of peanuts placed in such pool by that producer, except 
that the proceeds available for the amount of distribution shall be 
subject to any other conditions and offsets set forth in this section; 
and
    (2) Distributions shall not be assigned to any other party.
    (f) Loan indebtedness. With respect to determining the gains and 
losses in accordance with this section for loan pools for quota and 
additional peanuts, the term ``indebtedness'' with respect to a pool 
shall include, but is not limited to, the following expenses associated

a lot of additional peanuts has consented to an ``immediate buyback'' of 
such peanuts by a handler, as indicated by a designation recorded on the 
form ASCS-1002, the handler that acts for the marketing association in 
advancing funds to the producer for a price support loan at the 
additional loan rate on such peanuts may purchase such peanuts from the 
marketing association for domestic edible use in accordance with 
instructions from the marketing association and at a price equal to 100 
percent of the quota loan value of such peanuts plus a handling charge, 
as determined by the marketing association and approved by CCC, to cover 
all costs incurred with respect to such peanuts for inspection, 
warehousing, shrinkage, and other expenses.
    (2) Time for buyback purchase. An ``immediate buyback'' purchase may 
be made only in connection with the marketing association involved in 
the price support loan and only on the date on which the peanuts were 
delivered by the producer as collateral for a price support loan. Such 
sales are for the account of CCC.
    (3) Handler requirements. For each ``immediate buyback,'' the 
handler shall:
    (i) Act for the marketing association by making a price support 
advance to the producer at the additional loan rate and in the same 
manner that would be applicable if an ``immediate buyback'' were not 
involved;
    (ii) If applicable, use such handler's funds to pay to the producer 
any premiums that the parties had agreed upon in order to effect the 
delivery of such peanuts;
    (iii) Pay for the peanuts by a check made payable to CCC. Such check 
must be from the handler's funds and in an

[[Page 478]]

amount equal to the quota loan value of the peanuts plus any handling 
charges; and
    (iv) Transmit the handler's check and the applicable form ASCS-1007 
to the marketing association by midnight of the third workday (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) following the day the peanuts 
were inspected.
    (4) Domestic edible use. The handler's check and the applicable form 
ASCS-1007 will identify the peanuts as additional peanuts that may be 
used for domestic edible use.
    (5) Loan pool credit. Irrespective of the segregation of such 
peanuts, the receipts from the ``immediate buyback'' sale will be 
credited to the additional loan pool for Segregation 1 peanuts and the 
peanuts will be treated as Segregation 1 peanuts for pool accounting 
purposes.
    (6) Loan pool participation. If Segregation 2 or Segregation 3 
peanuts are purchased by a handler under the ``immediate buyback'' 
provisions, the producer of such peanuts shall participate in the 
Segregation 1 additional loan pool in the same manner as would apply if 
such peanuts had been Segregation 1 peanuts.
    (7) Additional restrictions on ``immediate buyback'' sales. (i) 
Additional peanuts of the type contracted for export or crushing from a 
farm may not be purchased from such farm under the ``immediate buyback'' 
provisions of this section until all of the producer's contracts for 
additional peanuts for the relevant crop year have been satisfied for 
the type to be used for the buyback, as evidenced by a contract balance 
of zero for that type of peanuts on the farm's marketing card;
    (ii) An immediate buyback that otherwise is prohibited by paragraph 
(a)(7)(i) of this section may be permitted by CCC in the case of any 
producer on a farm who does not share in the additional peanuts for 
which there is a contract.
    (iii) An agreement between the handler and producer to void a 
contract that was approved in accordance with this part shall not reduce 
the balance shown on the producer's marketing card for contract 
additional peanuts and until such contract is renewed and satisfied the 
producer's additional peanuts of the same type as were covered by that 
contract shall not be eligible for that crop year for purchase under an 
``immediate buyback.''
    (b) Purchase of quota or additional loan peanuts. Quota loan 
peanuts, or additional loan peanuts that were not purchased by the 
handler under the ``immediate buyback'' provisions, may be bought for 
domestic edible use in accordance with this paragraph on an in-grade and 
in-weight basis.
    (1) In-grade and in-weight purchases. A handler may purchase loan 
peanuts, either quota or additional, on an in-grade and in-weight basis 
for domestic edible use:
    (i) Under terms and conditions established by the marketing 
association and CCC;
    (ii) If such peanuts are eligible for domestic edible use; and
    (iii) If such peanuts are stored in a warehouse that is operated by 
such handler.
    (2) Pricing. Except with respect to ``immediate buybacks,'' as 
provided for in this section, the price for peanuts purchased on an in-
grade and in-weight basis shall be determined by the marketing 
association or CCC, as applicable, for the account of CCC, but shall not 
be less than the applicable carrying charges plus, with respect to each 
lot of peanuts purchased:
    (i) 105 percent of the quota loan value that was or would be 
applicable to the quantity of loan peanuts in such lot, if paid for not 
later than December 31 of the marketing year; or
    (ii) 107 percent of the quota loan value that was or would be 
applicable to the quantity of loan peanuts in such lot, if paid for 
after December 31 of the marketing year.

   Subpart D--Handling Contract Additional Peanuts--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1446.401  Contracts for additional peanuts for crushing or export.

    An approved handler may contract with a producer to deliver 
additional peanuts for exporting or for crushing. In order to be valid, 
the contract must meet the eligibility requirements in this section and 
must be approved by the county committee that serves the county in which 
the producing farm is located for administrative purposes.
    (a) Contract form and addendum--(1) Contract form. In order to be 
approved by the county committee, the contract must be completed on Form 
CCC-1005, Handler Contract With Producers for Purchase of Additional 
Peanuts for Crushing or Export, or on a form approved by the Executive 
Vice President, CCC, or designee, which follows the organization of the 
CCC-1005 and contains as a minimum all of the requirements provided for 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Availability of CCC-1005. The marketing association shall make 
available a form CCC-1005 to each approved handler and to any producer 
upon request.
    (3) Addenda. The handler may use an addendum to a contract form if 
such addendum neither negates nor conflicts with any provision in this 
part. Any existing addendum to the contract which relates to the 
marketing of additional peanuts must accompany the contract at the time 
the contract is filed with the county committee.
    (b) Submitting contracts for approval--(1) Eligible handlers. Only a 
handler who has been approved by the marketing association to handle 
contract additional peanuts may contract with producers to buy 
additional peanuts for crushing or exportation, or both.
    (2) Producer-handlers. A person who has been approved as a producer-
handler under part 1421 of this title may not contract with himself/
herself to purchase contract additional peanuts that he/she may produce.
    (3) Place and time for submitting. In order to be considered for 
approval, any contract between a handler and producer for the purchase 
of additional peanuts shall be completed and submitted:
    (i) Place. To the county FSA office of the county in which the farm 
is administratively located.
    (ii) Time. On or before September 15 of the year in which the crop 
is produced; except that:
    (A) Should September 15 fall on a Saturday or Sunday, or other non-
workday the contract must be submitted for approval no later than the 
last workday immediately preceding the final contracting date.
    (B) If the Executive Vice President, CCC, determines that damaging 
weather such as drought, hail, excessive moisture, freeze, tornado, 
hurricane or excessive wind, or related condition such as insect 
infestations, plant diseases, or other deterioration of the peanut crop, 
including aflatoxin, is expected to have significant national impact on 
peanut production, the Executive Vice President may extend nationally, 
by up to 15 days, the final date for submitting contracts for approval. 
Such announcement shall be made no later than September 5 of the year in 
which the crop is produced.
    (c) Contract approval. (1) A contract between a handler and a 
producer for additional peanuts for crushing or export shall not be 
approved by the county committee, if otherwise eligible, unless the 
county committee has been notified by the State Executive Director that 
the handler has been approved to contract additional peanuts and that 
such handler has submitted the letter of credit that is required in 
accordance with the provisions in this part.

[[Page 480]]

    (2) In order to be approved, the following information must appear 
on the contract:
    (i) The name and address of the operator;
    (ii) The name and address of each producer sharing in the proceeds 
of the contract additional peanuts;
    (iii) The State and County code, and farm number of the farm on

peanuts that are contracted;
    (vi) The final contract price to be paid by the handler and shown as 
a set percentage of the loan rate for quota peanuts of the type 
indicated on the contract; except that such final contract price shall 
not be less than the additional loan rate for the type of peanut 
indicated on the contract. A contract or an addendum to a contract that 
provides for a conditional supplemental payment to the producer will not 
be considered to negate the final contract price only if the 
supplemental payment to be made is expressed in a manner that a third 
party may determine the amount of the supplemental payment without a 
need for additional negotiations;
    (vii) A disclosure by the producer of any liens or encumbrances on 
the peanuts;
    (viii) The signature of the farm operator;
    (ix) The signature of each person having an interest as a producer 
in the contract additional peanuts that are produced on the farm;

    (3) The county committee, or a person designated in writing by the 
county committee, shall approve each form CCC-1005 that conforms with 
the provisions in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.402  Approval as handler of contract additional peanuts.

    (a) General. By June 15 preceding the beginning of the marketing 
year in which such additional peanuts will be acquired, any handler who 
plans to acquire contract additional peanuts in accordance with this 
part for crushing or for exporting must:
    (1) Application. File an application with each marketing association 
that serves the area in which such handler plans to acquire contract 
additional peanuts. Such application:
    (i) Form. Must be on a form or in a format provided by the marketing 
association.
    (ii) Method of supervision. Must indicate the method of supervision, 
physical or nonphysical, selected by the handler for purposes of 
accounting for the disposition of any contract additional peanuts 
acquired by such handler.
    (2) Evidence of adequate assets and adequate facilities. Provide 
evidence that is acceptable to the marketing association and CCC that 
such handler has:
    (i) Assets. Adequate assets to assure compliance with the provisions 
in this part with respect to such handler's obligation to crush or 
export contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler; and
    (ii) Facilities. Adequate facilities to handle the acquisition and 
disposition of any contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler.
    (3) Letter of credit for prior crop years. Establish an irrevocable 
letter of credit, or increase any existing letter of credit applicable 
for a previous crop year, in an amount necessary to cover any 
outstanding marketing penalties on peanuts produced in such crop year 
which are still under administrative appeal or are unpaid. This 
requirement is in addition to any letter of credit requirement for the 
current year.
    (b) Approval. The marketing association, acting on behalf of CCC, 
shall approve, in accordance with this part, each application that is 
timely filed in accordance with this section, or is filed by such 
extended time as may be approved by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
provided that in either case, the applicant:

[[Page 481]]

    (1) Has selected a method of supervision;
    (2) Has a U.S. address;
    (3) Has provided evidence of adequate assets and adequate facilities 
to assure compliance with the provisions in this part with respect to 
the disposition of contract additional peanuts; and
    (4) Has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) Rescission of approval. Unless the Executive Vice President, 
CCC, shall otherwise agree in writing, a handler's previous approval to 
contract for the purchase of additional peanuts for exporting or 
crushing and to receive and handle such peanuts shall be considered to 
be rescinded upon such handler's use of facilities, other than those on 
which the approval was based, to receive, store, process, or ship 
contract additional peanuts. However, a rescission will not apply if 
substituted facilities are approved by the association, in accordance 
with instructions issued by CCC, when the handler can show, as 
determined by the association subject to review by the Executive Vice 
President, that the original facilities are no longer available for use 
due to circumstances beyond the handler's control such as, but not 
limited to, fire, flood, wind damage, or mechanical failure. In the 
event of rescission of a handler's approval, any purchases of peanuts 
from producers by such handler subsequent to the rescission will be 
considered as purchases of quota peanuts and will subject the handlers 
and producers to penalties, as prescribed by this part and in 7 CFR part 
729 for marketing excess quota peanuts unless such peanuts are recorded 
on the producer's marketing card as a marketing of quota peanuts.
    (d) Cost of supervision. The handler shall bear the cost of 
supervision irrespective of the method of supervision such handler has 
chosen.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.403  Letter of credit.

    (a) Certification and financial guarantee (letter of credit)--(1) 
Certification. In order to establish a letter of credit, each handler 
must certify to the applicable marketing association the quantity of 
additional peanuts the handler expects to contract for delivery by 
producers that are served by such marketing association. The certified 
poundage will be the basis for establishing the letter of credit for the 
applicable crop. If the certified poundage is less than the actual 
contracted poundage, the letter of credit required of the handler for 
the next marketing year shall be subject to increase, as provided in 
this section.
    (2) Letter of credit. The handler must present an irrevocable letter 
of credit to each marketing association that serves the area in which a 
handler plans to contract or otherwise acquire contract additional 
peanuts. Such letter of credit shall be issued in a form and by a bank 
which is acceptable to CCC and except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section shall be submitted to the appropriate marketing association 
not later than July 31 and before marketing cards will be issued to 
producers for contract additional peanuts. Unless the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are applicable, the amount of the 
letter of credit for each area shall be equal to the amount determined 
by multiplying 140 percent of the national average quota price support 
rate by, for a handler selecting nonphysical supervision, 8 percent, or, 
for a handler selecting physical supervision, 5 percent, of the larger 
of:
    (i) Ninety percent of the handler's contracted pounds as recorded on 
contracts approved by the county committee for the preceding marketing 
year and in the marketing area; or
    (ii) The amount of additional peanuts the handler estimates will be 
contracted with producers, as certified to the marketing association, 
for delivery during the current marketing year and in that marketing 
area.
    (b) Increase in letter of credit. (1) The amount of the letter of 
credit required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be increased 
for any handler:
    (i) Who has a poor performance record, as evidenced by previous 
penalty assessments for violations of the provisions of this part; or
    (ii) Who, for purposes of handling peanuts is, as determined by CCC, 
a partnership, merger, joint venture, or

[[Page 482]]

other similar business relationship having officials who were officials 
of an organization having such a record or is composed in whole or in 
part by merger, succession, consolidation, association or assimilation, 
of entities with such a record; or
    (iii) Whose total acquisition of farmers stock peanuts during the 
preceding marketing year from purchases of contract additional peanuts 
exceeded, by more than 3.0 percent, the pounds on which the letter of 
credit for the preceding marketing year was based. Nothing in this part 
shall prohibit CCC from demanding an increase in the letter of credit 
for the current year in the event the handler has significantly 
underestimated the handler's purchases for the current year.
    (2) The increase in the letter of credit shall be determined in 
accordance with the guidelines set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Guidelines for increasing letters of credit--(1) Increased 
letter of credit due to history of program violation. If the handler 
and/or related entity was assessed penalties for program violations for 
any of the previous three crop years, the percentage of the pounds of 
contracted peanuts to which the increase specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section shall be applied, shall be increased by 6 percent for each 
year of the three-year period in which such a penalty was assessed, 
except that:
    (i) Such increase for a particular crop year shall be 3 percent 
rather than 6 percent if, for all violations for that crop year:
    (A) The penalties were reduced by the Executive Vice President, CCC, 
and paid; or
    (B) Less than 120 days, or such further period as established by the 
Executive Vice President, have passed since the penalty assessment was 
made by the CCC Contracting Officer.
    (ii) Previous penalty assessments, other than assessments for 
violations that involve the importation of additional peanuts, or the 
failure to properly dispose of additional peanuts, which have been paid 
shall not be considered as part of the violation history for any crop 
year if the total violations for such crop year by the handler, and 
related individuals or entities, involved less than 100,000 pounds of 
peanuts.
    (2) Waiver of increase. Notwithstanding (c)(1) of this section, at 
the discretion of the Executive Vice President, CCC, the increase 
required under this section may be waived upon the presentment of 
adequate security as determined acceptable by the Executive Vice 
President, CCC.
    (3) Inaccurate certification of additional peanuts acquired. In 
addition to the increase required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
if the actual purchase of contract additional peanuts for the previous 
marketing year exceeds, by more than 3.0 percent, the poundage on which 
the previous marketing year's letter of credit was based, the pounds 
determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section shall be increased by an amount equal to 3 times the amount of 
such excess.
    (4) Basis for determining letter of credit amount. Any letter of 
credit determination under this section shall be based upon the facts as 
they exist on June 1 of the calendar year in which the letter of credit 
is to be supplied.
    (5) Unpaid interest. References to unpaid penalties in this section 
shall include associated unpaid interest and unpaid late payment 
charges.
    (d) Extension of time for filing letter of credit. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this section, upon a request from a handler, the 
Executive Vice President, CCC, may extend the time for filing of a 
required letter of credit if such an extension is considered necessary 
in order for the handler to have sufficient time to acquire necessary 
financing.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.404  Transfer of contracts prior to delivery.

    An approved contract, by which a handler is to purchase additional 
peanuts from a producer, may not be sold, traded, or assigned except as 
provided in this section.
    (a) Contract transfer and delivery of contracted peanuts to other 
handlers. (1) If a handler is otherwise unable to perform under any 
contract with a producer for the purchase of additional peanuts due to 
conditions beyond the

[[Page 483]]

handler's control, the handler and the producer may agree to the 
delivery of the peanuts to another handler under the terms of the 
original contract or under modified terms except that, the price, 
quantity, type, segregation or farm number as shown on the original 
contract may not be changed. Conditions considered beyond the handler's 
control may include, but are not limited to, insolvency, bankruptcy, 
death, or destruction of warehouse facilities.
    (2) A contract for additional peanuts shall not be transferred to 
another handler without the prior written approval of the Deputy 
Administrator. Such transfer shall be approved by the Deputy 
Administrator only if the Deputy Administrator determines that such 
transfer will not impair the effective operation of the peanut program.
    (3) If the receiving handler:
    (i) Has an existing letter of credit, such handler may increase the 
existing letter of credit to cover the total amount of farmers stock 
peanuts that is to be transferred. However, any increase must be made 
within 14 days after the transfer is approved, otherwise any increased 
letter of credit will not be considered for purposes of determining 
whether an increase will be required in the next year's letter of credit 
because of a deficiency in the letter of credit.
    (ii) Does not have an existing letter of credit, the transfer shall 
not be approved unless such handler secures an acceptable letter of 
credit to cover the amount of farmers stock peanuts that is to be 
transferred.
    (b) Contract transfer and transfer of delivery obligations to other 
producers. If a producer is unable to fully perform the terms of a 
contract with a handler for the purchase of additional peanuts due to 
conditions beyond the producer's control or other conditions as may be 
prescribed by CCC, the handler and the producer or the producer's 
successor-in-interest may agree to a modification of the contract or to 
the substitution of another producer either under the original terms of 
the contract or under modified terms that do not change the original 
contract price and quantity. Conditions considered to be beyond the 
producer's control may include, but are not limited to, farm 
reconstitution in some cases (combinations and divisions), insolvency, 
bankruptcy, or death but do not include failure to produce the 
contracted amount from the planted acreage of peanuts due to natural 
disaster or related conditions or failure to plant sufficient acreage to 
produce the contracted quantity. Such modifications or transfers of 
contract obligations shall not be valid without the prior written 
approval of the Deputy Administrator. A transfer shall be approved only 
if the Deputy Administrator determines that such modifications or such 
transfer will not impair the effective operation of the peanut program.
    (c) County committee approval. Contract modifications other than 
changes in producer, owner or operator, or changes permitted by this 
section, may not be approved by the county committee.

Sec. 1446.405  Inspection of contract additional peanuts.

    The type and quality of each lot of contract additional peanuts

valid, the inspection results shall be recorded on form ASCS-1007 and 
signed by the inspector.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.406  Commingled storage of contract additional peanuts.

    (a) Commingled storage. A handler may commingle quota loan, quota 
commercial, additional loan, and contract additional peanuts during 
storage. In such case the peanuts must be inspected on a farmers stock 
basis before such peanuts are placed in storage.
    (b) Accounting for commingled peanuts. Contract additional peanuts 
in commingled storage shall be accounted for on a:
    (1) Dollar value basis under physical supervision.
    (2) TKC basis under nonphysical supervision.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.407  Handler transfer of contract additional peanuts or transfer of disposition credit.

    (a) Liability and credit for export or crushing. Except as permitted 
by this section, a handler shall not:
    (1) Sell, assign or otherwise transfer liability for exporting or 
crushing contract additional peanuts to other handlers, or
    (2) Sell, assign, or otherwise transfer credits for exporting or 
crushing contract additional peanuts to other handlers.
    (b) Transfer of farmers stock contract additional peanuts. (1) A 
one-time transfer of farmers stock contract additional peanuts may be 
made between the entity shown as applicant 1 and the entity shown as 
applicant 2 on the form ASCS-1007 for the peanuts.
    (2) Such transfers shall be made within the same marketing area 
unless approved otherwise by the marketing association or the Deputy 
Administrator, and in accordance with instructions issued by CCC.
    (3) Before the transfer may be approved, the receiving handler's 
letter of credit shall be amended by an amount that will cover the 
amount of peanuts transferred and the transferring handler must submit 
to the marketing association for approval, a form CCC-1006, covering any 
proposed transfer of farmers stock peanuts.
    (4) Such approval must be obtained before any physical movement of 
the peanuts from the buying point.
    (5) The transfer of peanuts as farmers stock peanuts after sale by 
the producer shall not be permitted unless approved in writing by CCC or 
the marketing association.
    (c) Transfer of peanuts for processing into products. (1) Handlers 
may transfer contract additional peanuts and the liability for the 
export of contract additional peanuts to a processor of peanut products 
either as:
    (i) Milled peanuts; or
    (ii) Farmers stock peanuts under the provisions of paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (2) Such transfer shall be made in accordance with the provisions of 
this part.
    (d) Transfer of export credit for peanuts which have been exported. 
Credit for peanuts that have been exported under the provisions of this 
part will be given to the applicant shown on the form FV-184-9 for the 
lot of peanuts that has been exported. However, if a disclaimer to the 
credit for export is submitted with the applicable form FV-184-9, the 
export credit will be transferred to the person to whom the credit was 
assigned.
    (e) Transfer of credit for crushing. Disposition credit earned for 
peanuts crushed in accordance with the provisions of this part and under 
the supervision of the marketing association may be assigned to another 
person if a disclaimer to the credit for crushing is submitted with the 
applicable form FV-184-9.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.408  Decreasing or drawing upon a letter of credit.

    (a) Decreasing the letter of credit to reflect TKC obligation. Any 
existing irrevocable letter of credit that has been presented by a 
handler may be decreased after January 31 of the calendar year following 
the year in which the peanuts were produced, or such earlier date as may 
be authorized by the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, 
if the final TKC obligation determined for such handler, when converted 
to a farmers stock peanuts basis by dividing the TKC pounds by 0.795 for 
runner peanuts; 0.75 for Spanish peanuts; 0.735 for Virginia peanuts; or 
0.77 for Valencia peanuts, is less than the amount that would be 
applicable for such handler and for such amount of farmers stock peanuts 
as determined in accordance with Sec. 1446.403 of this part. The letter 
of credit may be decreased to the amount so determined.
    (b) Adjusting the letter of credit for acceptable proof of 
disposition. The handler shall deliver to the marketing association 
satisfactory evidence as described in this part, to verify that contract 
additional peanuts have been exported or otherwise disposed of in 
accordance with the provisions of this part. On January 31, of the 
calendar year following the year in which the peanuts were produced, and 
monthly thereafter of

[[Page 485]]

such following year, the marketing association shall permit a reduction 
of the letter of credit if the existing letter of credit exceeds 140 
percent of the national average quota price support rate for the 
applicable crop times the farmers stock equivalent of the remaining TKC 
obligation as determined in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (c) Drawing against the letter of credit. (1) If less than 16 days 
remain before the expiration of a handler's letter of credit, and upon 
authorization by CCC, the marketing association may draw against the 
letter of credit and apply the amount toward any penalty due for failure 
to properly dispose of, or account for, contract additional peanuts in 
accordance with this part if:
    (i) By the final disposition date required in this part, a 
deficiency remained in the handler's obligation to crush or export 
contract additional peanuts;
    (ii) By the date required in this part, the handler did not provide 
satisfactory documentary evidence of the full export of peanuts or 
peanut products; or
    (iii) The handler has committed another violation of this part with 
respect to such peanuts.
    (2) Any draw down against a letter of credit shall not compromise 
any penalty due CCC if the letter of credit is insufficient to cover the 
full amount of the penalty or prevent any re-determination of whether 
there has been a proper disposition of and/or accounting for peanuts.

representative of CCC or the marketing association:
    (a) May enter and remain upon any of the premises of the handler 
when such peanuts are being received, shelled, cleaned, bagged, sealed, 
weighed, graded, stored, milled, blanched, crushed, packaged, shipped,

<R05>
Sec. 1446.410  Disposition date.

    (a) Final disposition date. To avoid a penalty as provided in this 
part, a handler shall dispose of all contract additional peanuts, in

Sec. 1446.411  Export provisions.

    (a) Export to a U.S. Government agency. Except for the exportation 
of raw peanuts to the military exchange services of the United States 
for processing outside the United States, the export of peanuts in any 
form by or to a United States Government agency shall not be considered 
as export to an eligible country, but shall instead be considered a 
domestic edible use of such peanuts. However, sales to a foreign 
government which are financed with funds made available by a United 
States agency, such as the Agency for International Development or CCC, 
will not be considered sales to a United States Government agency if the 
peanuts are not purchased by the foreign buyer for transfer to an agency 
of the United States.
    (b) Export to an eligible country. All contract additional peanuts 
which are

[[Page 486]]

not crushed domestically (including approved processing into flakes) and

<R05>
Sec. 1446.413  Disposal of meal contaminated by aflatoxin.

    All meal produced from peanuts which are crushed domestically and 
found to be unsuitable for use as feed because of contamination by 
aflatoxin shall be disposed of for non-feed purposes only. If the meal

<R05>
Sec. 1446.414  Processing additional peanuts into products.

    (a) Type of supervision. A person, who plans to acquire additional 
peanuts from other handlers for processing into products for export, 
must register as a handler and choose a method of supervision in 
accordance with this section.

[[Page 487]]

    (b) Physical supervision. For purposes of this section, if physical 
supervision is chosen:
    (1) Such supervision shall be conducted in accordance with 
provisions of this part; and
    (2) The processor must provide a letter of credit to the marketing 
association as prescribed by this part which shall, to the extent 
practicable, be the same amount as the letter of credit that would be 
required in accordance with this part for an equal quantity of peanuts 
acquired by a handler who has entered into contracts for the purchase of 
additional peanuts and has chosen physical supervision.
    (c) Nonphysical supervision. For purposes of this section, if 
nonphysical supervision is chosen:
    (1) The processor shall:
    (i) Provide a written agreement that is signed by a duly authorized 
person, in which the processor agrees to export additional peanuts to an 
eligible country in such quantities and in accordance with such 
procedures as are specified by this part;
    (ii) Provide a letter of credit to the marketing association which 
shall, to the extent practicable, be the same amount as the letter of 
credit that would be required in accordance with this part for an equal 
quantity of peanuts acquired by a handler who has entered into contracts 
for the purchase of additional peanuts and has chosen nonphysical 
supervision; and
    (iii) Provide to the marketing association a description of the type 
of product that will be processed, the type of containers, size of 
containers, and the standard peanut processing yield for the product.
    (2) The processor shall submit proof of export to the marketing 
association of like kind, as determined by the marketing association, as 
that required by this part for exports of peanuts under nonphysical 
supervision.
    (3) Upon verification of product yield by the marketing association, 
approval of the form CCC-1006, and approval of the letter of credit, a 
product export obligation will be established on marketing association 
ledgers and the processor will be notified of the quantity of product 
export obligation.
    (4) Upon receipt of proof of export that is acceptable to the 
marketing association, the processor, with the concurrence of the 
marketing association, may reduce the letter of credit to the extent 
that such letter of credit exceeds the amount determined by the 
marketing association, in accordance with instructions issued by FSA, to 
be necessary to assure compliance by the processor with the provisions 
in this part.
    (d) Applicability of regulations. By registering as a handler and 
selecting a method of supervision in accordance with this section, a 
processor of peanuts shall be considered to have agreed:
    (1) To perform in accordance with the provisions of this part;
    (2) That the provisions of this part such as access to facilities, 
fraud, liens against peanuts on which penalty is due, and any other 
provisions that apply to a handler of additional peanuts, shall apply to 
the processor; and
    (3) That the processor shall be considered as a handler for purposes 
of applying the penalty provisions of this part.
    (e) Records. A peanut processor shall maintain records that will 
enable the marketing association or other representative of the 
Secretary to determine compliance with the provisions of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.415  Prohibition on importation or reentry of contract additional peanuts.

    Neither exported contract additional peanuts nor peanut products 
made from additional peanuts shall be imported or reentered in 
commercial quantities by anyone into the United States in any form. If 
contract additional peanuts or peanut products made from such peanuts 
are imported or reentered into the United States, the handler importing 
such peanuts or peanut products shall be liable for a penalty assessed 
in accordance with this part, for reentering contract additional 
peanuts.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.416  Suspension of restrictions on imported peanuts.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if the President 
issues a

[[Page 488]]

proclamation under section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1933, as amended, temporarily suspending restrictions on the importation 
of peanuts, a handler, with the written consent of the producer and CCC, 
may purchase additional peanuts from any producer who, in accordance 
with this part, contracted with the handler to deliver additional 
peanuts to such handler and may use such peanuts for sale for domestic 
edible use without incurring any marketing penalty for failure to crush 
or export such peanuts. However, the maximum quantity of peanuts that 
may be purchased by such handler in accordance with this provision of 
this section is the quantity of contract additional peanuts that remains 
undelivered by such producer under the contract. For purposes of 
application of this section, a proclamation temporarily increasing the 
import quota shall not be considered the same as a temporary suspension 
of restrictions on the importation of peanuts.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.417  Loss of peanuts.

    Should a handler suffer a loss of peanuts as a result of fire, flood 
or any other condition beyond the control of the handler, the portion of 
such loss that may be attributed to contract additional peanuts, as 
determined by the marketing association shall not be greater than an 
amount determined by dividing the total of the contract additional 
peanuts acquired by the handler during the year by such handler's total 
peanut purchases for the year and multiplying the result by the quantity 
for which acceptable proof of loss has been furnished to the marketing 
association. Such attribution shall take into account any dispositions 
of peanuts that occurred prior to the loss of the peanuts for which the 
attribution is made.

  Subpart E--Handling Contract Additional Peanuts-Physical Supervision


<R05>
Sec. 1446.501  Accounting for contract additional peanuts acquired under physical supervision.

    (a) Commingled storage--(1) General. For a handler operating under 
physical supervision, contract additional peanuts placed in commingled 
storage must be accounted for on a dollar value basis less a one time 
adjustment for shrinkage for each crop.
    (2) Shrinkage. For peanuts that are graded out and accounted for:
    (i) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.
    (ii) After January 31 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.5 percent for all other peanuts.
    (3) Records. The handler shall maintain a copy of each form ASCS-
1007 that was issued for any peanuts that are placed in commingled 
storage and that is issued for any peanuts removed from storage.
    (b) Supervised identity preserved storage. For a handler operating 
under physical supervision, contract additional peanuts may be stored 
identity preserved and may be accounted for by disposing of the entire 
contents of the peanuts in each identity preserved warehouse in 
accordance with this part and under the supervision of a representative 
of the marketing association. In such case:
    (1) All peanuts that are loaded into each warehouse must be 
inspected as farmers stock peanuts and must be loaded under the 
supervision of the marketing association.
    (2) At the end of each day in which peanuts are placed in or removed 
from the warehouse, the warehouse must be sealed by a representative of 
the marketing association.
    (3) Each warehouse seal may be removed only by a representative of 
the marketing association.
    (4) The marketing association shall be reimbursed by the handler for 
all expenses of providing a representative to supervise the loading and 
unloading of each warehouse.
    (c) Nonsupervised identity preserved storage--(1) Conditions. For a 
handler operating under physical supervision, contract additional 
peanuts may be stored identity preserved without supervision at the time 
of loading the

[[Page 489]]

peanuts into each warehouse, but only if:
    (i) All peanuts that are loaded into a warehouse are inspected prior 
to loading into such warehouse and a form ASCS-1007 prepared for each 
lot that is inspected;
    (ii) The entire contents of each warehouse will be removed and 
disposed of in accordance with this part and under supervision of a 
representative of the marketing association; and
    (iii) The peanuts are accounted for on a dollar value basis except 
that shrinkage, in the amounts provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, will be allowed if the dollar value of the peanuts that are 
loaded out of each warehouse is less than the dollar value of the 
peanuts that were loaded into such warehouse.
    (2) Shrinkage. For peanuts that are graded out and accounted for:
    (i) Before February 1 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 3.5 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.0 percent for all other peanuts.
    (ii) After January 31 of the applicable marketing year, the 
adjustment of the dollar value for shrinkage shall be:
    (A) 4.0 percent for Virginia-type peanuts; and
    (B) 3.5 percent for all other peanuts.
    (3) Records. The handler shall maintain a copy of each form ASCS-
1007 that is issued for any peanuts that are placed in nonsupervised 
identity preserved storage and that is issued for any peanuts that are 
removed from such storage.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.502  Physical supervision of contract additional peanuts.

    (a) Supervision. A handler who has chosen to operate under physical 
supervision shall make arrangements that are satisfactory to the 
marketing association for representatives of the marketing association 
to conduct onsite supervision of domestic handling of contract 
additional peanuts including storing, shelling, crushing, cleaning, 
milling, blanching, weighing, and shipping.
    (b) Final dates for scheduling supervision. Contract additional 
farmers stock peanuts shall be scheduled for supervision by the 
marketing association during the normal marketing period but not later 
than August 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the crop 
was grown, unless prior approval of a later date has been made by the 
marketing association.
    (c) Notifying the marketing association. Before moving or processing 
any contract additional peanuts, the handler or an agent of the handler 
shall notify the marketing association of the time such operation will 
begin and the approximate period of time required to complete the 
operation. When a plant is not currently under supervision, the handler 
shall give at least five working days of advance notice to the marketing 
association so that supervision can be arranged.
    (d) Processing. The identical peanuts identified at time of load-out 
as contract additional peanuts shall be shelled or otherwise milled, 
crushed, or shelled and crushed under supervision of the marketing 
association as a continuous operation separate from other peanuts. 
Shelled peanuts shall be identified with positive lot identity tags 
before being stored and moved for crushing, exportation, or processing 
into peanut products to be exported. Except as otherwise authorized by 
the marketing association, such peanuts will be considered as having 
been crushed or exported only if positive lot identity has been 
maintained in the following manner:
    (1) Transportation. The peanuts shall be transported from storage 
locations in a covered vehicle such as a truck or railroad car. The 
vehicle shall be sealed unless the marketing association determines that 
identity of the peanuts can be maintained without sealing.
    (2) Storage. Farmers stock peanuts shall be stored in a separate 
building(s) or bin(s) which can be sealed or which the marketing 
association otherwise determines will satisfactorily maintain lot 
identity. Milled peanuts shall be stored in such a manner that the 
marketing association, under procedures issued by CCC, may make periodic 
inventory verification of the contract additional lots that are shown on 
marketing association records as being in the storage facility. The 
handler shall

[[Page 490]]

furnish to the marketing association the name and location of the 
storage facilities in which the contract additional peanuts are located.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.503  Disposition requirements under physical supervision.

    (a) Methods of disposition. Except under the provisions of 
Sec. 1446.504 of this part applicable to substitution, the identical 
contract additional farmers stock peanuts and milled peanuts that are 
shelled under supervision of the marketing association and formed into 
lots shall be disposed of, in accordance with the provisions of this 
part that are applicable to contract additional peanuts and to physical 
supervision, by domestic crushing or by export to an eligible country as 
follows:
    (1) All kernels may be crushed domestically under supervision of the 
marketing association representative; or
    (2) All kernels may be exported for crushing, if fragmented; or
    (3) All kernels that meet the standards established for the domestic 
market under the Marketing Agreement No.146 may be exported and the 
remaining kernels crushed domestically under supervision of the 
marketing association representative; or
    (4) All of the peanuts may be exported as farmers stock peanuts, 
provided that such peanuts meet the standards established for the 
domestic market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146 and are positive 
lot identified; or
    (5) The peanuts may be exported to an eligible country as peanut 
products if such products are produced domestically; or
    (6) The peanuts may be exported as milled or in-shell peanuts if 
they meet the edible export standards established for the domestic 
market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146; or
    (7) The peanuts may be considered exported or crushed if it is 
determined by CCC that such peanuts have been destroyed or otherwise 
made unsuitable for any commercial purpose.
    (b) Peanuts diverted. Contract additional peanuts, or peanut 
products made from contract additional peanuts, that are diverted to any 
country other than an eligible country shall not be credited in the 
handler's favor against the handler's obligation to crush or export such 
peanuts.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.504  Substitution of quota and additional peanuts.

    (a) Substitution of quota peanuts which have been exported--(1) 
Farmers stock peanuts. With prior notification to and approval of the 
marketing association, farmers stock quota peanuts that have been 
exported from the same crop, type, quality, and area may be substituted 
for additional peanuts that otherwise would have to be exported in 
accordance with this part to avoid a penalty.
    (2) Milled peanuts. With prior notification to and approval by the 
marketing association, peanuts that are milled under supervision of the 
marketing association may be used to replace, in domestic edible use, 
quota peanuts that have been exported to an eligible country from the 
same crop, type, area, and of the same grade as recognized by the Peanut 
Administrative Committee (PAC) for edible quality grades. Such grades 
shall be established at the time the peanuts are milled and the lot is 
formed unless CCC directs otherwise in writing. The quota peanuts that 
are exported, for which substitution is requested, must have been 
positive lot identified and otherwise handled as additional peanuts 
under the supervision of the marketing association.
    (b) Use of additional peanuts for domestic edible uses prior to 
substitution--(1) General requirements. Additional peanuts may be used 
for domestic edible use with prior notification and approval of the 
marketing association and upon presentation to the marketing association 
of an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount that is determined in 
the same manner as such handler's initial letter of credit for the 
quantity of peanuts that will be substituted. Such letter of credit is 
in addition to the letter of credit required in accordance this part as 
a condition for approval of contracts for additional peanuts. Such 
additional letter of credit for substitution shall be issued in a

[[Page 491]]

form and by a bank which is acceptable to CCC.
    (2) Submitting evidence of export. The handler subsequently shall 
dispose of a like amount of quota peanuts in the manner prescribed in 
this part for contract additional peanuts. If the quota peanuts are 
exported, the handler shall subsequently deliver to the marketing 
association satisfactory evidence that a like amount of quota peanuts of 
the same type and of a similar grade has been exported. Such evidence 
must be submitted no later than the earlier of:
    (i) 30 days after the final date for export as established in 
accordance with this part; or
    (ii) 15 days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit.
    (3) Failure to timely submit evidence of export. If satisfactory 
evidence is not presented by such date determined in (b)(2) of this 
section, CCC may authorize the marketing association to draw against the 
letter of credit for the full amount of the penalty which would 
otherwise be due for failure to dispose of contract additional peanuts 
in accordance with this part.


<R04>
Subpart F--Handling Contract Additional Peanuts--Nonphysical Supervision


<R05>
Sec. 1446.601  Disposition requirements under nonphysical supervision.

    (a) Disposition requirement. With respect to any marketing year, a 
handler who has selected nonphysical supervision shall account for the 
disposition of any contract additional peanuts acquired by such handler 
by providing evidence that is satisfactory to the marketing association 
of the quantity of peanuts by peanut type that are crushed or exported 
by such handler in each of the following kernel categories:
    (1) SS kernels;
    (2) SMK's; and
    (3) AO kernels.
    (b) SS kernels. (1) For each lot of contract additional peanuts 
acquired by such handler for which a deduction would have been 
applicable for SS kernels under the applicable price support loan 
schedule, deduct, from the percentage of SS kernels in such lot of 
peanuts, a number of percentage points equal to the maximum percentage 
of SS kernels that a lot of peanuts could contain without having a 
deduction for SS kernels under the applicable price support loan 
schedule and multiply the result by the total weight of the TKC content 
of the lot, excluding the weight of the LSK's in such lot.
    (2) Determine separately, for each type of peanuts acquired by such 
handler, the total of the results obtained in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section for all lots of contract additional peanuts acquired by such 
handler.
    (3) For each type of peanuts acquired by such handler, multiply the 
result determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by 0.955 in order 
to provide an allowance for shrinkage. The result is the minimum 
quantity of SS kernels of peanuts of the respective type that shall be 
crushed or exported by such handler.
    (c) SMK and SS kernels. (1) Determine, by type, the total of the 
quantity of SMK and SS kernels in the lots of contract additional 
peanuts acquired during the marketing year by such handler.
    (2) From the total determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
deduct the amount determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (3) For each type of peanuts acquired by such handler, multiply the 
results obtained in (c)(2) of this section by 0.955. The result is the 
minimum combined quantity of SMK's and SS kernels (excluding the 
quantity of SS kernels required to be crushed or exported as determined 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) of the respective type that shall 
be exported or crushed by such handler.
    (d) AO kernels. (1) Determine, by type, the total quantity of TKC in 
the lots of contract additional peanuts acquired during the marketing 
year by such handler.
    (2) From the total determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
deduct:
    (i) The amount of SS kernels determining in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The combined SMK's and SS kernels determined in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (3) Multiply the result determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section by 0.955.

[[Page 492]]

The result is the total of the AO kernels of the respective type that 
shall be exported or crushed by such handler.
    (e) Substitution prohibited. Disposition credit shall not be 
granted:
    (1) To the obligation to export or crush SS kernels and SMK for any 
amount of AO kernels that may have been exported or crushed in excess of 
the quantity required in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) To the obligation to export or crush AO kernels for any amount 
of SS kernels and SMK's that may have been exported or crushed in excess 
of the quantity required in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) To the obligation to export or crush peanuts of a type, for a 
surplus amount of contract additional peanuts exported or crushed from 
another type.
    (f) Peanuts diverted. Contract additional peanuts or peanut products 
made from contract additional peanuts diverted to any country other than 
eligible country shall not be credited in the handler's favor against 
the handler's obligation to crush or export such peanuts.

<R05>
Sec. 1446.602  Disposition credit for peanuts under nonphysical supervision.

    (a) Disposition credits. Contract additional peanuts of the same 
crop year and of like type shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
provisions of this part. Disposition shall be by domestic crushing or by 
export to an eligible country. Disposition credit shall, subject to the 
provisions of this part, be granted for:
    (1) Kernels that are crushed domestically under physical supervision 
of the marketing association representative; or
    (2) Kernels that are exported for crushing, if fragmented before 
being exported; or
    (3) Exported kernels that meet PAC outgoing quality standards for 
domestic edible use; or
    (4) Peanuts that are exported as farmers stock peanuts, provided 
that such peanuts meet PAC incoming quality standards for Segregation 1

    (5) Peanuts that are exported to an eligible country as peanut 
products if such products are produced domestically in accordance with 
provisions of this part; or
    (6) Peanuts that are exported as milled or in-shell peanuts if they 
meet PAC outgoing quality standards for domestic edible peanuts; or
    (7) Peanuts that are exported as blanched peanuts; or
    (8) Peanuts that are determined by the marketing association as 
having been destroyed or otherwise made unsuitable for any commercial 
purpose. In such case the peanuts shall be considered as crushed.
    (b) Requesting physical supervision of crushing for disposition 
credit. Prior to the disposition date for contract additional peanuts, 
as provided in this part, a handler operating under the provisions of 
this part with respect to nonphysical supervision may request and 
arrange for the marketing association to supervise the crushing of SMK, 
SS and AO peanuts for disposition credit for the applicable kernel type 
by obtaining physical supervision of the peanuts under the following 
conditions:
    (1) Milled peanuts. A request to change to physical supervision for 
crushing milled peanuts for SMK, SS or AO credit may be made at any time 
prior to the final disposition date for additional peanuts for the 
relevant crop year. Physical supervision of milled peanuts shall be 
provided under the provisions of this part applicable to physical 
supervision of milled peanuts. The marketing association may require 
that positive identified lots be regraded before crushing.
    (2) Farmers stock peanuts. A request to change to physical 
supervision for crushing farmers stock peanuts must be made and approved 
prior to the peanuts being graded out of commingled storage. In order to 
determine the categories, by peanut type, for the kernels that are 
crushed, namely SS, SMK and AO kernels, physical supervision must begin 
at the gradeout from commingled storage and continue through the 
crushing of the peanuts as required in accordance with this part for a 
handler who chooses physical supervision for disposition of contract 
additional farmers stock peanuts.

[[Page 493]]

    (c) Determining disposition credit. Disposition credit for SMK, SS 
and AO kernels crushed under physical supervision shall be determined 
for farmers stock peanuts from the applicable form ASCS-1007, and for 
milled peanuts from the applicable form FV-184-9.
    (d) Application of crushing credits to disposition obligation--(1) 
Milled peanuts. Milled peanuts that are crushed under physical 
supervision for disposition credit may receive credit as follows:
    (i) If such peanuts meet PAC outgoing quality standards for domestic 
edible peanuts, disposition credit may apply pound-for-pound toward 
meeting the respective SMK, SS, or AO kernel obligations for the 
respective like peanut type and for like kernel type.
    (ii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC outgoing quality standards for 
domestic edible use due to aflatoxin contamination, disposition credit 
may apply to the SMK, SS or AO kernel obligations for the respective 
like peanut type and for like kernel type; except that, the percentage 
of such peanuts to which such credit will be allowed for each peanut 
type and kernel type shall not exceed the percentage of the total 
quantity of the respective type of peanuts that was purchased by the 
handler for the marketing year as contract additional peanuts.
    (iii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC outgoing quality standards 
for reasons other than aflatoxin contamination, disposition credit must 
be applied exclusively as AO kernels.
    (2) Farmers stock peanuts. Farmers stock peanuts that are crushed 
under physical supervision for disposition credit may receive credit as 
follows:
    (i) If such peanuts meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts, disposition credit may apply pound-for-pound 
toward meeting the respective SMK, SS, or AO kernel obligations for the 
respective like peanut type and for like kernel type.
    (ii) If such peanuts fail to meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts, disposition credit may apply to the SMK, SS or AO 
kernel obligations for the respective like peanut type and for like 
kernel type; except that, the percentage of such peanuts to which such 
credit will be allowed for each peanut type and kernel type shall not 
exceed the percentage of the total quantity of the respective type of 
peanuts that was purchased by the handler for the marketing year as 
contract additional peanuts.
    (iii) If such peanuts do not meet PAC incoming quality standards for 
Segregation 1 peanuts for any reason other than the presence of A. 
flavus mold, disposition credit must be applied exclusively as AO 
kernels.
    (3) Adjusting export credit for average dollar value of farmers 
stock peanuts. If CCC determines that the average dollar value of edible 
farmers stock peanuts graded out of commingled storage and crushed for 
export credit under the provisions of this section is less than the 
average dollar value of all like type peanuts purchased by the handler 
as contract additional peanuts, the amount of export credit for each 
kernel type determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be 
adjusted by multiplying each quantity for each kernel type by a factor 
to be determined by dividing:
    (i) The average dollar value per ton of peanuts graded out of the 
handler's commingled storage, accounted for as set forth in this part, 
and crushed for export credit under the provisions of this section; by
    (ii) The average dollar value per ton of all peanuts purchased by 
the handler as contract additional peanuts.
    (e) Blanching exception. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
part, a handler may receive credit for the pre-blanching weight of SS 
and SMK peanuts that are blanched for export if both the blanching and 
the crushing of the residue are conducted under supervision of agents of 
CCC or the marketing association. The maximum credit that may be 
received shall be:
    (1) The quantity of SMK and SS kernels as shown on the FV-184-9 that 
is submitted for proof of export for such blanched peanuts;
    (2) The quantity of the residue that is crushed under physical 
supervision; and
    (3) The pre-blanched or ``redskin'' weight less the quantities in 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, to the extent of such amount 
that the marketing association determines is

[[Page 494]]

reasonable and comparable with standard industry practices.
    (f) Export credits. In order to receive export credit toward meeting 
a handler's obligation to crush or export additional peanuts such 
exported peanuts must meet the outgoing quality standard established for 
the domestic market under the Marketing Agreement No. 146. Export credit 
will be granted in accordance with this paragraph for any exported 
peanuts that meet such quality standards.
    (1) Credit for exporting SMK peanuts. Credit for exporting SMK's of 
the same crop year, of like type, may be earned for:
    (i) The total pounds in a lot of exported peanuts which meet or 
exceed U.S. Standard grade for U.S. No. 1; or
    (ii) The total pounds, excluding splits as determined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii) of this section, in a lot of peanuts which meet PAC standards 
for:
    (A) Whole kernel peanuts with splits, or
    (B) No. 2 Virginia peanuts; or
    (iii) The total pounds determined to be SMK's in a lot of exported 
in-shell peanuts which meet U.S. Standard grade for cleaned Virginia 
type peanuts in the shell.
    (2) Credit for exporting SS kernels. Credits for SS kernels of the 
same crop year, of like type, may be earned for:
    (i) The total pounds in a lot of exported peanuts which meet the 
U.S. Standard grade for splits; or
    (ii) The total pounds, excluding SMK's as determined in paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii) of this section, in a lot of peanuts which meets PAC 
standards for:
    (A) Whole kernel with splits, or
    (B) No. 2 Virginia; or
    (iii) The total pounds determined to be SS kernels in a lot of 
exported in-shell peanuts which meet U.S. Standard grade for cleaned 
Virginia type peanuts in the shell.
    (3) Export credits for contract additional peanuts processed into 
products for export. To receive disposition credit for contract 
additional peanuts used in products for export, the shelled peanuts must 
be identified with positive lot identity tags before being moved for 
processing in accordance with provisions of this part. The peanuts shall 
be processed under supervision of the marketing association unless the 
processing handler selects to process such peanuts under nonphysical 
supervision.
    (4) Export credits for in-shell peanuts. With respect to peanuts 
exported in-shell, in accordance with instructions issued by CCC, 
credits may be earned for SMK, SS or AO kernels on the respective 
portions of the TKC of the lot that are SMK, SS or AO kernels.

               Subpart G--Penalties and Liquidated Damages


<R05>
Sec. 1446.701  Excess marketing of quota peanuts.

    A handler will be subject to a penalty for noncompliance with this 
part, if, as determined under this part, from any crop of peanuts, such 
handler markets, for domestic edible use, a larger quantity, or higher 
grade or quality of peanuts, than could reasonably be produced from the 
quantity of peanuts having the grade, kernel content, and quality of 
farmers stock peanuts purchased by the handler during the applicable 
marketing year as quota peanuts, including those peanuts purchased in 
accordance with the ``immediate buyback'' provisions of this part. In 
such case, the penalty will be an amount equal to 140 percent of the 
national average quota support rate for the applicable crop, times that 
quantity of farmers stock peanuts which are determined by CCC to be 
necessary to produce the excess quantity or grade or quality of peanuts 
marketed.


<R05>
Sec. 1446.702  Peanuts ineligible for quota loan.

    Any person who causes or permits peanuts that are not eligible 
peanuts to be pledged as collateral for a loan at the quota loan rate 
shall be considered to have agreed that:
    (a) CCC may incur serious and substantial damage to its program to 
support the price of quota peanuts because such peanuts were pledged as 
collateral for a quota loan;
    (b) The amount of such damages will be difficult, if not impossible, 
to ascertain exactly; and
    (c) Such person shall, with respect to any ineligible peanuts placed 
under quota loan, pay to CCC, as liquidated damages and in addition to 
any penalty that is due, the difference between the quota loan rate for 
such peanuts and the additional loan rate that would apply to peanuts of 
the same type and quality, times the amount of such peanuts that were 
placed under loan. It is agreed that such liquidated damages

[[Page 496]]

are a reasonable estimate of the probable actual damages which CCC would 
suffer. Such person shall pay the damages to CCC promptly upon demand in 
addition to penalties as may be due or assessed. Liquidated damages 
under this section may be reduced by CCC based upon consideration of the 
following factors:
    (1) Whether the person causing or permitting ineligible peanuts to 
be placed in the loan program made a good faith effort to ensure that 
ineligible peanuts were not pledged as loan collateral;
    (2) The degree of damage or potential damage to the price support 
program caused by the violation;
    (3) The nature and circumstances of the violation;
    (4) The extent of the violation; and

    (b) Amount of penalty. Except when reduced in accordance with this 
part, the penalty amount for any violation of this part shall be equal 
to 140 percent of the national average quota support rate for the

of any penalty provided for in these regulations shall be liable also 
for interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest 
which was charged CCC by the Treasury of the United States on the date 
such penalty became due. The date on which the penalty became due shall

imposed upon a handler or other person in accordance

[[Page 498]]

with this part is paid, a lien shall exist in favor of the United States 
for the amount of the penalty. Such lien shall apply on the peanuts with 
respect to which such penalty is incurred and on any other peanuts 
purchased or otherwise acquired in the same or subsequent marketing year 
in which the person liable for payment of such penalty has an interest.

                     Subpart A--Tobacco Loan Program

    Source: 45 FR 9253, Feb. 12, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.1  Administration.

    (a) This program will be administered by the Tobacco and Peanuts 
Division, FSA, under the general direction and supervision of the 
Executive Vice President, CCC. The program will be carried out by 
cooperative marketing associations (hereinafter referred to as 
``associations'') acting on behalf of their producer members. To obtain 
a price support loan, an association must enter into a loan agreement 
with CCC. The loan agreement will set forth terms and conditions for 
making price support available to producers. To the extent provided in 
the loan agreement, an association shall meet the eligibility 
requirements for price support prescribed in the Cooperative Marketing 
Associations Eligibility Requirements for Price Support (part 1425 of 
this chapter), as amended. CCC reserves the right to restrict the number 
of associations with which it will contract. In so doing, CCC will 
select such associations as it deems necessary or desirable to 
effectuate the purposes of the program with a maximum of efficiency and 
economy of operations. The names of such associations may be obtained 
from the Tobacco and Peanuts Division, FSA, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013.
    (b) Each year CCC will make loans to associations. The associations 
in turn will make price support advances available to eligible producers 
either directly or through auction warehouses. The tobacco on which 
producers receive price support advances will serve as security for the 
loans. Loans made to associations will include not only the initial loan 
value of the tobacco, but also amounts to cover costs of receiving, 
processing, storing, and selling the loan tobacco, including that part 
of overhead costs not borne by the

[[Page 502]]

association pursuant to Sec. 1464.4. Associations will be authorized to 
enter into contracts for these services through the usual trade 
channels. Loans also may include amounts to cover any Federal and State 
income taxes which the associations are required by the Internal Revenue 
Service or State governmental body to pay on income received from the 
sale of loan tobacco.

[45 FR 9253, Feb. 12, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 51555, Nov. 16, 1982; 48 
FR 21110, May 11, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.2  Availability of price support.

    (a) Kind of tobacco. Price support will be available to eligible 
producers on the following kinds of eligible tobacco subject to 
conditions listed in Secs. 1464.7 and 1464.8 respectively.

Flue-cured tobacco, types 11, 12, 13, and 14.
Kentucky-Tennessee Fire-cured tobacco, types 22 and 23.
Virginia Fire-cured tobacco, type 21.
Virginia Sun-cured tobacco, type 37.
Dark Air-Cured tobacco, types 35 and 36.
Burley tobacco, type 31.
Cigar filler and binder tobacco, types 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, and 55.

    (b) Method of providing price support--(1) Through auction 
warehouses. (i) Price support will be available for each lot of eligible 
tobacco offered for sale at auction warehouses which have contracted 
with an association, on a form of agreement approved by CCC, to make 
price support advances to producers on behalf of the association. 
Producers will deliver their tobacco to auction warehouses which will 
display the tobacco and offer it for sale at auction. Each contract 
between an association and an auction warehouse will require the auction 
warehouse to see that producers are informed that price support advances 
are available for each lot of eligible tobacco offered for sale at 
auction when the final bid is less than the price support rate available 
for the grade of eligible tobacco comprising such lot. For Flue-cured 
and Burley tobacco, the associations' contracts with auction warehouses 
will also require the auction warehouses to mark any tobacco sale bill 
``No Price Support'' if the marketing of the pounds of tobacco covered 
by such bill will result in the producer marketing in excess of 103 
percent of the producer's effective farm marketing quota. Producers will 
receive price support advances from the warehouse operator for any 
tobacco to be consigned by the warehouse operator to the association. 
Price support advances will be paid to the producer at the time the 
warehouse operator settles with the producer for the entire quantity of 
the producer's tobacco that has been displayed for inspection and 
offered for sale on any one day's auction market. The warehouse operator 
will be reimbursed by the association with funds borrowed from CCC.
    (ii) Price support will be available only at warehouses where 
tobacco inspection service is provided by the Agricultural Marketing 
Service, USDA. Inspection and price support services may be extended to 
new markets or to additional sales on established markets in accordance 
with this part and Subpart A of part 29 of this title which provides for 
formal public hearings prior to extending of additional services.
    (iii) CCC reserves the right to direct the association to withhold a 
contract under the price support program from any auction warehouse for 
one or more years if, based on previous performance of similar 
contracts, or other evidence, there is substantial reason to believe 
that such warehouse will not fulfill its contract obligations.
    (2) Special requirements for flue-cured tobacco. Price support will 
be available only on flue-cured tobacco which has been designated for 
sale at specific warehouses by the producer under the following 
conditions:
    (i) Definition. Producer as used in this paragraph means the person 
who was issued the tobacco marketing card pursuant to part 723 of this 
title.
    (ii) Producer designation of warehouses. Producers will be required, 
as a condition of price support, to designate the warehouses at which 
they will market their tobacco. Such designations may be at any 
warehouse or warehouses in any market within a radius of 100 miles from 
the county seat of the county in which the farm is located, or if such 
farm is physically within two counties, then from the county seat of the 
county in which the county FSA office administering that farm is 
located. To the extent there are less than

[[Page 503]]

eight markets within such radius, any warehouse or warehouses in any of 
the eight markets nearest to the county seat may be designated. A 
producer may obtain price support only in a warehouse which the producer 
has designated, and at each such warehouse only with respect to the 
quantity of tobacco designated for sale at such warehouse.
    (iii) When producer designations shall be made. Producers must 
designate the warehouse(s) at which they will market their tobacco 
during a period which shall be announced beforehand by the local county 
FSA office. The period for making designations shall be before May 31 
each year. Producers who lease quota or whose farm is reconstituted (the 
combining or dividing of a farm due to a change in operation) after such 
period may designate the warehouse(s) at which their tobacco will be 
marketed according to procedures to be established by the Deputy 
Administrator, State and County Operations, FSA. Producers who have 
designated warehouses which cease to operate or cease to have tobacco 
inspection or price support available may change their designations at 
any time after such occurrences. Producers who have designated 
warehouses whose inspection services have been temporarily suspended for 
any reason for the equivalent of at least one sales day may change their 
designation at any time after such occurrences. Redesignation (changes 
in warehouse(s) designated or in pounds designated to a warehouse) or 
designations for farms which have not previously designated tobacco may 
be made by producers during the five business days ending on the first 
Friday of each month during the flue-cured tobacco marketing season. 
Such redesignation or initial designation shall be made on any one day 
of each redesignation period. Such redesignation or initial designation 
shall be effective on the second Monday following the Friday on which 
the redesignation period ends.
    (iv) Form and content of designations. A designation shall be made 
for each warehouse at which a producer desires to market tobacco by 
executing a form provided by the county FSA office. The producer will be 
required to indicate on such form the name of the warehouse or 
warehouses designated by the producer and the pounds of flue-cured 
tobacco the producer desires to sell at such warehouse as well as any 
other information required to be stated on such form.
    (v) Entering warehouse designation information. The warehouse code 
number of the warehouse the producer has designated will be indicated on 
the farm marketing card. If an effective date is determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, such effective 
date will be shown on the farm marketing card. If the producer has not 
designated a warehouse, a warehouse code will not be shown on the 
marketing card. Changes in designation by the producer shall be 
accomplished by the producer returning the marketing card to the county 
FSA office and requesting the transfer of any unmarketed pounds of flue-
cured tobacco shown on any marketing card to another eligible warehouse 
or warehouses.
    (vi) Use of warehouse designation information. (A) A separate sale 
bill marked ``no price support'' shall be prepared for that quantity of 
tobacco weighted in that is in excess of the balance of the pounds 
designated as shown on the marketing card:
    (B) The warehouse shall mark ``no price support'' on a sale bill for 
any tobacco which is presented for sale and which is accompanied by a 
marketing card which does not show a warehouse code, which shows a code 
of another warehouse, or which shows an effective date which is later 
than the date on which the tobacco is presented for sale.
    (vii) Availability of designation information. Each county FSA 
office shall send all designations received to the Flue-Cured Tobacco 
Cooperative Stabilization Corporation, Raleigh, North Carolina, 
following each designation period and each period for changing 
designations. That association shall inform the Flue-Cured Tobacco 
Advisory Committee of the pounds designated to each warehouse and the 
pounds of any undesignated tobacco which, for the purpose of 
recommending opening dates and selling schedules in accordance with part 
29 of this title, is available for apportioning for sale at each 
warehouse. That association also shall

[[Page 504]]

furnish each warehouse the name and address of the producers who 
designated the warehouse, the pounds each designated and the pounds 
which represented 103 percent of the marketing quota of each such 
producer.
    (viii) Failure to comply with opening date and selling schedule by 
warehouses. Warehousemen shall comply with opening date and selling 
schedule requirements as provided in 7 CFR 29.9406.
    (3) Upon direct delivery to the Association. Eligible producers in 
nonauction market areas may deliver eligible tobacco to central 
receiving points designated by the appropriate association.
    (4) Period of price support. Price support will be available to 
eligible producers on eligible tobacco only during each year's normal 
marketing season for each kind of tobacco for which support is provided.
    (5) Beginning with the 1981 crop, eligible producers may obtain 
price support on untied burley tobacco packed in bales subject to the 
following conditions:
    (i) The quality and condition of the tobacco contained in each bale 
delivered for price support as a single lot will be representative of 
the quality and condition of the tobacco contained in all other such 
bales of the same lot.
    (ii) The tobacco in each bale will be stalk-cured.
    (iii) The bales will not contain foreign matter or conceal inferior 
tobacco.
    (iv) Specification of bales:
    (A) Bales must be approximately 1 x 2 x 3 feet in size.
    (B) The leaves in bales must be untied and oriented.
    (C) The basket ticket shall show the number of bales in the lot. 
Each bale in the lot shall be identified by a uniform identification tag 
1\5/8\ inches wide by 3\1/4\ inches long which shall be attached 
securely to the bale and shall show at least the following information: 
(1) Warehouse registration number, (2) basket ticket identification 
number, and (3) bale number.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.3  Level of price support.

    (a) The level of price support for eligible tobacco shall be 
determined in accordance with section 106 of the Agricultural Act of 
1949, as amended.
    (b) Flue-Cured tobacco of varieties Coker 139, Coker 140, Coker 316, 
Reams 64, Reams 266, and Dixie Bright 244, or a mixture or strain of 
such seed varieties or any breeding line of Flue-Cured tobacco seed 
varieties, including, but not limited to, 187 Golden Wilt (also 
designated by such names as No-Name, XYZ), having the quality and 
chemical characteristics of the seed varieties designated as Coker 139, 
Coker 140, Coker 316, Reams 64, Reams 266, or Dixie Bright 244 will be 
supported at one-half the support rate, plus 50 cents per hundred 
pounds, for comparable grades of acceptable varieties.

[51 FR 32426, Sept. 12, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.4  Deductions from advances.

    (a) There may be deducted from price support advances paid to 
tobacco producers amounts to help defray administrative overhead costs 
incurred by producers associations through which price support is made 
available to tobacco producers.
    (b) If any producer on a farm is indebted to the United States and 
such indebtedness is listed on the Claim Control Record, Form ASCS-604, 
the Government will effect collection of the amount of the indebtedness 
by setoff from the amount of price support advance due the producer in 
the following manner: Any marketing card covering tobacco eligible for 
price support issued for such farm in accordance with the applicable 
regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to 
marketing quotas (parts 723 of this title) will bear a notation showing 
the indebtedness, the name of the debtor and the amount of the 
indebtedness. The acceptance and use of a marketing card bearing a 
notation of indebtedness to the United States by a producer named as 
debtor on such card will constitute an authorization by such producer to 
any tobacco warehouse operator or association to pay the United States 
the price support advance due the producer to the extent of their 
indebtedness set forth on such card but

[[Page 505]]

not to exceed that portion of the price support advance remaining after 
deduction of usual warehouse and authorized price support charges and 
amounts due prior lienholders. The acceptance and use of a marketing 
card bearing a notation and information of indebtedness to the United 
States will not constitute a waiver of any right of the producer to 
contest the validity of such indebtedness by appropriate administrative 
appeal or legal action.

[45 FR 9253, Feb. 12, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 28608, July 1, 1982; 56 
FR 21259, May 8, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1464.5  Interest rate and general provisions.

    The loans made to the associations will bear interest at the rate 
announced by CCC and will be nonrecourse both as to principal and 
interest except in the case of misrepresentation, fraud or failure to 
carry out the loan agreement. Tobacco loses its identity as to original 
ownership through commingling in the packing process, and individual 
producers may not redeem their tobacco once it has been pledged as 
security for the loan. Associations will sell the loan tobacco as 
provided in the loan agreements for each crop, and the net proceeds of 
sales of the loan collateral of each crop will be applied to the loan 
account for such crop until the loan is repaid in full. With respect to 
the 1981 and prior crops, if the proceeds from the sale of loan 
collateral of the 1981 or any prior crop exceed (a) the amount of the 
loan plus all fees, handling charges, operating costs and interest; and 
(b) any amount due CCC under a barter transfer agreement entered into 
between CCC and the association, such excess shall constitute ``net 
gains'' and shall be distributed in cash by the association to the 
producers who placed the tobacco under loan unless other disposition is 
approved by CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1464.6  Maturity date.

    Loans made under the program will mature on demand.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.7  Eligible producer.

    To qualify as an eligible producer for purposes of receiving price 
support during the current marketing year a person must have eligible 
tobacco, as provided in Sec. 1464.8, for marketing and such person:
    (a) Must have agreed to make contributions to a No Net Cost Fund or 
pay assessments to a No Net Cost Account, as applicable, in accordance 
with Sec. 1464.10.
    (b) Must not have been found, after notice and opportunity for an 
administrative hearing in accordance with part 780 of this title, to 
have:
    (1) Knowingly delivered nested tobacco for the purpose of receiving 
price support.
    (2) Filed a false report with respect to the use of pesticides on 
tobacco produced for marketing during the current marketing year.
    (3) Erroneously represented any fact affecting a tobacco program 
determination.
    (4) Adopted any scheme or device which tends to defeat the purpose 
of the tobacco program.
    (5) Made any fraudulent representations with respect to the tobacco 
program.
    (c) Must be in compliance with the provisions of part 12 of this 
title.
    (d) Must not be ineligible, in accordance with part 1498 of this 
title, to receive price support payments, loans, and benefits.
    (e) With respect to any tobacco which is presented for price 
support, must have retained beneficial interest in the tobacco prior to 
presenting the tobacco for such loan.
    (1) For purposes of this section, the producer will be considered to 
have retained beneficial interest in the tobacco only if such producer 
has complete control of and title to such tobacco, including the right 
to tender such tobacco to CCC for a price support loan on the date such 
tobacco is tendered to CCC for a price support loan, and has maintained 
this right and that interest in the tobacco at all times prior to 
presenting the tobacco for the loan.
    (2) If a producer receives a monetary advance or other consideration 
in connection with or for such tobacco, the

[[Page 506]]

producer will be deemed for purposes of this section to have lost 
beneficial interest in such tobacco unless the producer has a written 
agreement with the person who provides the advance payment or 
consideration and such agreement accurately and fully:
    (i) Sets forth the amount, nature and date of the advance or 
consideration;
    (ii) Sets forth the poundage on which the advance or consideration 
was made;
    (iii) Provides that the tobacco will be sold at a producer auction 
through an auction warehouse at which price support is provided, or will 
be presented for a price support loan;
    (iv) Provides that as a full and final settlement on the tobacco, 
the full sales price at the producer auction or the full loan proceeds 
will be paid to the producer minus only the following:
    (A) Any advance set out in the agreement; and
    (B) Standard published assessments or charges for services rendered 
at standard published rates that apply to all tobacco of all producers, 
including tobacco for which no advance has been paid;
    (v) Sets forth the date of final settlement to be made on the 
tobacco which date can be no later than the date applicable to tobacco 
on which no advance has been made.
    (vi) States that the full profit and beneficial interest in the 
tobacco, and full control of the tobacco, remains with the producer and 
provides that the full profit and beneficial interest will remain with 
the producer at all times prior to any disposition of the tobacco as 
producer tobacco, or at a producer auction, or presenting for a price 
support loan.
    (3) A producer will be considered to have lost beneficial interest 
in tobacco and thereby not be an ``eligible producer'' for such tobacco 
as of the date any advance or other preauction arrangement was made if 
CCC determines for that tobacco that:
    (i) The advance per pound equalled or exceeded the producer's final 
net proceeds per pound on all tobacco marketed from the farm for that 
marketing year at producer auctions, including any tobacco on which an 
advance is made or the pledging of tobacco for price support loans;
    (ii) A written agreement was required by paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, but none has been executed; or
    (iii) A written agreement was executed but did not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) If tobacco is pledged for a price support loan and the producer 
is not then or thereafter deemed to be or to have been an eligible 
producer for that tobacco for purposes of placing the tobacco under such 
loan, then the tobacco shall be considered to have a loan value of zero. 
The producer and the person that took possession of the tobacco from the 
producer, or paid an advance, or marketed the tobacco, or disposed of 
the tobacco as producer tobacco, shall be jointly and severally liable 
with the producer for returning any loan proceeds previously paid in the 
name of, or for the account of, the producer. Further, the disposition 
of any tobacco as producer tobacco where the producer is not then or 
thereafter considered to have been an eligible producer with respect to 
such tobacco may be the subject of penalties on the grounds of false 
identification, excess marketings, or otherwise as provided in part 723 
of this title. These remedies are in addition to any others as may 
apply.
    (f) Must be in compliance with the provisions of parts 400 and 402 
of this title by purchasing an amount of catastrophic insurance coverage 
which equals or exceeds the minimal required under those parts.

Sec. 1464.8  Eligible tobacco.

marketing assessment (BDMA) shall be remitted by all importers of 
tobacco for tobacco entered into the commerce of the United States.
    (b) Period of coverage. Except as provided for in (h), this section 
shall only apply to tobacco imported after September 13, 1995, and 
through the 1998 calendar year.
    (c) Tobacco covered. Except as provided in (g) and (h), this section 
shall only apply to unmanufactured tobacco entered for consumption into 
the commerce of the United States that is, as determined by the 
Director, the same kind or a like kind of tobacco for which a domestic

provided in (g) and (h), this section shall not apply to cigar kinds of 
tobacco.

[[Page 513]]

    (d) Rate. Except as provided in (h) and subject to provisions in 
this section dealing with mixed lots, the BDMA rate shall be the rate 
for the corresponding domestic tobacco for the marketing year for the 
domestic tobacco which is in progress when the imported tobacco becomes 
subject to the assessment. The BDMA rate shall be applied on a per 
kilogram basis to all quantities of such tobacco imported for 
consumption, except for de minimis special entries approved by the 
Director.
    (e) Mixed entries. For entries of mixed kinds of tobacco, the 
importer shall certify the composition of the mixed lot and remit the 
amount of assessment due for the respective quantity of each applicable

importers of tobacco to establish that their tobacco is not subject to 
any BDMA or is not subject to a higher BDMA than that claimed to be due 
by such importer. All importers of tobacco must, accordingly, maintain 
sufficient records to demonstrate that they are not liable for a higher 
BDMA amount. Disputes involving the application of the BDMA shall be 
resolved by the Director.
    (h) Tobacco entered prior to September 13, 1995. Notwithstanding 
other provisions of this section, all imported tobacco which was entered 
for consumption into the United States from January 1, 1994, through 
September 13, 1995, shall be subject to a BDMA to the extent provided 
for under those rules which were in effect under this part during that 
period. BDMA's payable for that period shall be paid by the importer and 
shall be at the rate specified in those rules and subject to the terms 
of those rules.

assessment referred to in Sec. 1464.102, if an importer fails to pay or 
to timely remit the BDMA, such importer shall be subject to a marketing 
penalty at a per kilogram rate equal to 75 percent of the average market 
price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the respective like 
kind domestic tobacco being imported for the domestic marketing year 
which immediately preceded the domestic marketing year in which the 
imported tobacco became subject to the BDMA. Such marketing penalty rate 
shall apply to the quantity of tobacco on which the failure occurred. 
Amounts due for the penalty shall be in addition to any other amount as 
may be due, including, but not limited to, the amount due for the BDMA 
itself, or any applicable late fees, charges, or interest.
    (2) Importer no-net-cost assessment. With respect to assessments 
referred to in Sec. 1464.103, if an importer of burley or flue-cured 
tobacco fails to timely remit a no-net-cost assessment in accordance 
with the provisions in this subpart, such importer shall be liable, in 
addition to any no-net-cost assessment or other sum due and any late 
payment charges, to a marketing penalty at a per kilogram rate equal to 
75 percent of the average market price (calculated

[[Page 515]]

to the nearest whole cent) for the respective kind of domestic tobacco 
(burley or flue-cured) for the respective domestic tobacco marketing 
year in which such imported tobacco was imported, on the quantity of 
tobacco as to which the failure occurs.
    (b) Exception to marketing penalty. A marketing penalty otherwise 
required by this paragraph may be forgiven if the assessment for which 
nonpayment of the penalty could be assessed is remitted not later than 
15 calendar days after the date otherwise required for the remittance by 
this subpart.
    (c) Notification of marketing penalty. Before a marketing penalty is 
assessed, the importer shall be notified of the pending assessment and 
shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the 
assessment of the penalty. Such notification will be by, and such 
hearing will be before, the Director or designee.
    (d) Marketing penalty reduction. The Executive Vice President, CCC, 
or designee, may reduce the amount of any marketing penalty for which a 
person otherwise would be liable under the provisions of this section 
upon finding that failure to comply was unintentional or without 
knowledge on the part of such person and that such reduction would not 
damage the tobacco program or the administration of this part.
    (e) Prohibition of use, processing or marketing of tobacco for which 
the assessments have not been paid; other remedies. The knowing use, 
processing, or marketing of tobacco in the commerce of the United States 
of any tobacco for which an assessment or related charge required or 
provided for by this subpart is past due, is prohibited. The penalties 
and other remedies provided in this section shall be in addition to, and 
not exclusive of, other remedies that may be available.

retained for a period of three years following the date of entry of such 
tobacco. The burden of establishing compliance with this part shall be 
on the importer of the tobacco.
    (b) Examination of records and reports. The Executive Vice 
President, CCC, the Director, or any person authorized by one of such 
persons, or any auditor or agent of the Office of the Inspector General, 
is authorized to examine any records that such person has reason to 
believe are relevant to any matter pertinent to the payment of importer 
assessments under this subpart. Upon request of an authorized person, 
each importer shall make available for examination such records as are 
under such importer's control that may be relevant to imported tobacco 
that is subject to an assessment in accordance with this subpart or 
otherwise relevant to the administration of this subpart. Upon a failure 
to provide access or records, the Director may presume that such an 
inquiry would have produced information unfavorable to the party to the 
inquiry and shall make further determinations in the matter accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 1464.108  Reconsideration and appeal.

    An importer may request the Director to reconsider any determination 
of the amount of any assessment due, any marketing penalty assessed, or 
other adverse determination rendered in accordance with this subpart. 
Any request for reconsideration shall be made within 30 calendar days of 
the date of the notification of such assessment, marketing penalty, or 
adverse determination. If the importer is dissatisfied with a 
determination rendered by the Director with respect to a request for 
reconsideration, such importer may appeal the determination to the 
Director, National Appeals Division, FSA. Any such appeal shall be 
handled in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 780.

agricultural land that NRCS determines poses a serious threat to soil, 
water, or related natural resources by reason of the soil types; 
terrain; climate; soil, topographic, flood, or saline characteristics; 
or other factors or natural hazards, including the existing agricultural 
management practices of the applicant, may be eligible for enrollment in 
EQIP. Additionally, land may only be considered for enrollment in EQIP 
if NRCS determines that the land is:
    (1) Privately owned land;
    (2) Publicly owned land where:
    (i) The land is under private control for the contract period and is 
included in the participant's operating unit;
    (ii) Conservation practices will contribute to an improvement in the 
identified natural resource concern; and
    (iii) The participant has provided CCC with written authorization 
from the government landowner to apply the conservation practices; or
    (3) Tribal, allotted, or Indian trust land.
    (e) Fifty percent of available EQIP funds will be targeted to 
livestock-related natural resource concerns, including concerns on 
grazing lands and other lands directly attributable to livestock, 
measured at the national level.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.5  Priority areas and significant statewide natural resource concerns.

    (a)(1) Consistent with maximizing the overall environmental benefits 
per dollar expended by the program, NRCS may:
    (i) Designate a watershed, an area, or a region of special 
environmental sensitivity or having significant soil, water, or related 
natural resource concern as a priority area and give special 
consideration to applicants who have conservation plans that address the 
natural resource concern(s) for which the priority area was designated;
    (ii) Designate national conservation priority areas where the nature 
or scope of a natural resource concern necessitates greater coordination 
of efforts across boundaries; and
    (iii) Identify significant statewide natural resource concerns 
outside a priority area.
    (2) In addition to other factors identified in this section, 
priority areas, national conservation priority areas, and significant 
statewide natural resource concerns shall emphasize off-site benefits to 
the environment and coordination with other Federal and non-Federal 
conservation programs, including the Conservation Reserve Program and 
the Wetlands Reserve Program.
    (b) CCC may approve technical, educational, and financial assistance 
under this part to participants with significant statewide natural 
resource concerns outside a priority area.
    (c) To be considered for approval of a priority area, a Federal, 
State, or local government agency, Indian tribe, or a private group or 
entity shall work cooperatively with a respective local work group and 
State technical committee in identifying potential priority areas. The 
local work group shall obtain input from private individuals, groups, 
and organizations when considering and identifying potential priority 
areas. Proposals developed at the local level shall be reviewed by the 
State technical committee which makes a recommendation to the NRCS State 
conservationist. The priority area proposal shall include:
    (1) A description, quantified when and where possible, of the nature 
and

[[Page 522]]

extent of natural resource concerns in the proposed area;
    (2) A description, quantified when and where possible, of how the 
proposed goals, objectives, and solutions for the natural resource 
problems would maximize the environmental benefits that would be 
delivered with the requested Federal dollars, both within the priority 
area and as part of the overall program provided under this part;
    (3) Background information such as science-based data on 
environmental status and needs, soils information, demographic 
information, and other available technical data that illustrate the 
nature and extent of natural resource concerns in the priority area or 
the appropriateness of the proposed solution to those natural resource 
concerns.
    (4) The existing human resources, incentive programs, education 
programs, and on-farm research programs available at the Federal, State, 
Indian tribe, and local levels, both public and private, to assist with 
the areawide activities;
    (5) The technical, educational, and financial assistance needed from 
EQIP to help meet the areawide goals and objectives;
    (6) Ways and means to measure performance and success, quantified 
when and where possible, and plans to use existing or obtain additional 
science-based information; and
    (7) An explanation, quantified when and where possible, of the 
degree of difficulty producers face in complying with environmental 
laws.
    (d) The NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee and based on recommendations of local work groups, 
will approve the designation of a priority areas and make funding 
recommendations to the Chief. NRCS will evaluate proposals for priority 
area designations according to natural resource and environmental 
factors as identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the economic 
significance of the factors, the incorporation of conservation practices 
that best address the factors, and the ability to obtain multiple 
conservation benefits relative to the significance of these natural 
resource factors.
    (1) NRCS shall consider the following factors in determining the 
significance of the natural resource concern(s) identified in the 
proposal:
    (i) Soil types and characteristics;
    (ii) Terrain and topographic features;
    (iii) Climatic conditions;
    (iv) Flood hazards;
    (v) Saline characteristics of land or water;
    (vi) Environmental sensitivity of the land, such as wetlands and 
riparian areas;
    (vii) Quality and intended use of the land;
    (viii) Quality and intended use of the receiving waters, including 
fishery habitat and source of drinking water supply;
    (ix) Wildlife and wildlife habitat quality and quantity;
    (x) Quality of the air; or
    (xi) Other natural hazards or other factors, including the existing 
agricultural management practices of the producers in the area or pest 
problems which may threaten natural resources.
    (2) NRCS will consider the following factors in its allocation of 
funds:
    (i) Condition of the natural resources;
    (ii) Significance of the natural resource concern;
    (iii) Improvements that NRCS expects will result from implementation 
of the conservation plan;
    (iv) Expected number of producers who will participate and the time 
and financial commitment that the producers will provide;
    (v) Estimated program cost to provide technical, educational, and 
financial assistance;
    (vi) Level of coordination with and support from existing Federal, 
State, tribal, and local programs, including private sources, and both 
direct and in-kind contributions;
    (vii) Ways the program can best assist producers in complying with 
Federal, State, and tribal environmental laws, quantified where 
possible; and
    (viii) Other factors the NRCS determines will result in maximization 
of environmental benefits per dollar expended.

[[Page 523]]

    (e) A NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with a State 
technical committee and based on recommendations of a local work group, 
may approve program assistance to participants with significant 
statewide natural resource concerns outside a funded priority area.
    (f)(1) The Chief may designate national conservation priority areas 
using the identified national program objectives and criteria. The Chief 
may receive nominations from Federal, State, or local government 
agencies, Indian tribes, or private groups or entities, and may consult 
with other Federal agencies in selecting national conservation priority 
areas. Consistent with maximizing the overall environmental benefits per 
dollar expended by the program, the Chief may designate national 
conservation priority areas under this part to provide technical 
assistance, cost-share payments, incentive payments, and education for 
producers to comply with nonpoint source pollution requirements, other 
Federal, State, tribal or local environmental laws, or to meet other 
conservation needs.
    (2) NRCS will consider the following factors in deciding whether to 
designate a national conservation priority area in which program 
assistance will be provided:
    (i) Condition of the natural resources;
    (ii) Significance of the natural resource concern;
    (iii) Improvements that NRCS expects will result from implementation 
of the conservation plan;
    (iv) Expected number of producers who will participate and the time 
and financial commitment that the producers will provide;
    (v) Estimated program cost to provide technical, educational, and 
financial assistance;
    (vi) Level of coordination with and support from existing State and 
local programs, including private sources, and both direct and in-kind 
contributions;
    (vii) Ways the program can best assist producers in complying with 
Federal, State, and tribal environmental laws, quantified where 
possible; and
    (viii) Other factors that will assist CCC in maximizing the overall 
environmental benefit per dollar expended under this part.
    (g) NRCS will establish program outreach activities at the national, 
State, and local levels in order to ensure that producers whose land has 
environmental problems and natural resource concerns are aware, 
informed, and know that they may be eligible to apply for program 
assistance. Special outreach will be made to eligible producers with 
historically low participation rates, including but not restricted to 
limited resource producers, small-scale producers, Indian tribes, Alaska 
natives, and Pacific Islanders.
    (h) NRCS State conservationists shall develop an education plan that 
describes the educational assistance that will be provided to enhance 
program participant's knowledge about conservation opportunities, will 
aid in implementing their conservation plan, and enhance environmental 
benefits that will be realized through implementation of the program. In 
the development of the education plan, NRCS will design a coordinated 
approach, including national, State, and local components depending on 
the similar or unique education needs identified. NRCS will encourage 
cooperation among education providers, such as the Extension system, 
conservation districts, State agencies, and other public and private 
education providers, as well as the use of existing educational 
resources, material, or programs that deal with natural resource related 
issues.
    (i) The Chief, with FSA concurrence, will make funding decisions for 
national conservation priority areas, State-approved priority areas, and 
significant statewide natural resource concerns outside a funded 
priority area.
    (1) After review of funding requests, the Chief may base funding 
decisions on an allocation process which considers:
    (i) The significance of the environmental and natural resources 
conditions;
    (ii) Factors used and considered in accordance with paragraphs (d) 
and (f) of this section;

[[Page 524]]

    (iii) The need to maximize environmental benefits per dollar 
expended;
    (iv) The capability of the partners involved in the proposal to 
provide flexible technical, educational, and financial assistance;
    (v) The conservation needs of farmers and ranchers in complying with 
the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions of part 12 
of this title and Federal, State, and tribal environmental laws;
    (vi) The opportunity for encouraging environmental enhancement;
    (vii) The anticipated or proven performance of the partners involved 
in the proposal in delivering the program; and
    (viii) Other relevant information to meet the purposes of the 
program as found in this part.
    (2) In evaluating the considerations described in paragraph (i)(1) 
of this section, the Chief may consult other Federal agencies with the 
appropriate expertise and information.
    (3) The approval of a priority area at the State level does not 
necessarily mean that funds will be allocated to that area. Funding may 
be allocated to a priority area for one or more years. Proposals that 
are not funded may be resubmitted to the Chief for subsequent review and 
consideration to determine if the resubmitted proposal meets Federal 
priorities for funding.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.6  Conservation plan.

    (a) The participant shall develop and submit a conservation plan for 
the farm or ranch unit of concern that, when implemented, protects the 
soil, water, or related natural resources in a manner that meets the 
purpose of the program, is acceptable to NRCS, and is approved by the 
conservation district. This plan forms the basis for an EQIP contract.
    (1) When considering the acceptability of the plan, NRCS will 
consider whether the participant will use the most cost-effective 
conservation practices to solve the natural resource concerns and 
maximize environmental benefits per dollar expended.
    (2) As determined by NRCS, the conservation plan must allow the 
participant to achieve a cost-effective resource management system, or 
some appropriate portion of that system, identified in the applicable 
NRCS field office technical guide, for the priority natural resource 
condition of concern in the priority area or the significant statewide 
natural resource concern outside a funded priority area.
    (b) Upon a participant's request, the NRCS may provide technical 
assistance to a participant. NRCS may utilize the services of qualified 
personnel of cooperating Federal, State, or local agencies, Indian 
tribes, or private agribusiness sector or organizations, in performing 
its responsibilities for technical assistance. Participants may use the 
services of qualified non-NRCS professionals to provide technical 
assistance. NRCS retains approval authority over the technical adequacy 
of work done by non-NRCS personnel for the purpose of determining EQIP 
contract compliance.
    (c) Participants are responsible for implementing the conservation 
plan. A participant may seek additional assistance from other public or 
private organizations or private agribusiness sector as long as the 
activities funded are in compliance with this part.
    (d) All conservation practices scheduled in the conservation plan 
are to be carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS field 
office technical guide.
    (e) The conservation plan, or supporting documentation, for the farm 
or ranch unit of concern shall include:
    (1) A description of the prevailing farm or ranch enterprises and 
operations that may be relevant to conserving and enhancing soil, water, 
or related natural resources;
    (2) A description of relevant natural resources, including soil 
types and characteristics, rangeland types and conditions, proximity to 
water bodies, wildlife habitat, or other relevant characteristics 
related to the conservation and environmental objectives of the plan;
    (3) A description of the participant's specific conservation and 
environmental objectives to be achieved;
    (4) To the extent practicable, the quantitative or qualitative goals 
for achieving the participant's conservation and environmental 
objectives;

[[Page 525]]

    (5) A description of one or more conservation practices in the 
conservation management system to be implemented to achieve the 
conservation and environmental objectives;
    (6) A description of the schedule for implementing the conservation 
practices, including timing and sequence; and
    (7) Information that will enable evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the plan in achieving the conservation and environmental objectives.
    (f) To simplify the conservation planning process for the 
participant, the conservation plan may be developed, at the request of 
the participant, as a single plan that incorporates, to the extent 
possible, any or all other Federal, State, tribal, or local government 
program or regulatory requirements. Participants do not need to replace 
existing plans developed by natural resource professionals if such plans 
meet the resource management objectives under this part. NRCS may accept 
an existing conservation plan developed and required for participation 
in any other USDA program if the conservation plan otherwise meets the 
requirements of this part. When a participant develops a single 
conservation plan for more than one program, the participant shall 
clearly identify the portions of the plan that are applicable to the 
EQIP contract. It is the responsibility of the participant to ascertain 
and comply with any and all applicable program or regulatory 
requirements, and the NRCS development or approval of a conservation 
plan shall not be deemed to constitute compliance with program or 
regulatory requirements administered or enforced by another agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.7  Conservation practices.

    (a)(1) The NRCS, with FSA consultation, shall provide guidance for 
determining structural, vegetative, and land management practices 
eligible for program payments. To be considered as an eligible 
conservation practice, the practices must provide beneficial, cost-
effective approaches for participants to change or adapt operations to 
conserve or improve soil, water, or related natural resources or to 
provide for environmental enhancement.
    (2) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee or local work group, shall determine the 
conservation practices eligible for program payments for the priority 
area or for significant statewide natural resource concerns outside a 
priority area.
    (3) Where new technologies or conservation practices that provide a 
high potential for maximizing the environmental benefits per dollar 
expended have been developed, NRCS may approve interim conservation 
practice standards and financial assistance for pilot work to evaluate 
and assess the performance, efficacy, and effectiveness of the 
technology or conservation practices at maximizing environmental 
benefits per dollars expended. NRCS may involve other entities in the 
pilot testing, including conservation districts, extension and research 
agencies and institutions, private agribusiness sector, and others.
    (b)(1) CCC cannot provide cost-share assistance to construct an 
animal waste management facility on a large confined livestock 
operation. CCC may fund other structural, vegetative, or land management 
practices needed in the conservation management system to address the 
livestock-related natural resource concerns on a large confined 
livestock operation. Except as provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, CCC will consider a producer with confined livestock operations 
of more than 1,000 animal unit equivalents to be a large confined 
livestock operation and ineligible for financial assistance for 
construction of an animal waste management facility. When determining 
the number of livestock in the participant's operation for eligibility 
purposes, the total number of animals confined at all locations of the 
participant's livestock operation will be used.
    (2) The NRCS State conservationist may develop a definition for a 
large confined livestock operation as it applies to that particular 
State using criteria recommended by the State technical committee. The 
criteria will consider but not be limited to such factors as:

[[Page 526]]

    (i) The cost-effectiveness of the facility and its potential to 
maximize environmental benefits per dollar expended;
    (ii) The ability of the producer to pay for the cost of animal waste 
management facilities;
    (iii) The significance of the natural resource concern resulting 
from the operation;
    (iv) The prevailing State, Tribe, or local implementation of various 
Federal, Tribal, and State environmental laws and regulations, including 
regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
et seq.) and guidance developed under Sec. 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act 
Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 1455b);
    (v) The particular characteristics of modern livestock operations; 
and
    (vi) The size of the operation in relation to other confined 
livestock operations in the State or region.
    (3) The NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee, shall place emphasis on the considerations 
contained in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section when 
developing the criteria to define a large confined livestock operation.
    (4) The definitions developed by NRCS State conservationists must be 
approved by the Chief, who will also provide oversight on their 
implementation. In approving the definitions the Chief will consider:
    (i) The justification for the definition; and
    (ii) The need for consistency in the definitions used between and 
among States, to the greatest extent possible.
    (5) The Chief will report semiannually to the Secretary during the 
first two years of the program on the implementation of paragraph (b) of 
this section, including the impact that may have occurred to the 
environment and to the structure of livestock agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.8  Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel not affiliated with USDA.

    (a) A NRCS State conservationist may utilize technical and other 
assistance from qualified personnel of other Federal, State, and local 
agencies, or Indian tribes, and will encourage producers to use the most 
cost-effective technical assistance available, including if appropriate, 
using the services of the private agribusiness sector to carry out the 
assigned responsibilities of the program.
    (b) Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel 
not affiliated with USDA may include, but is not limited to: 
conservation planning; conservation practice survey, layout, design, 
installation, and certification; information, education, and training 
for producers; and training, certification, and quality assurance for 
professional conservationists.
    (c) NRCS shall provide technical coordination and leadership for the 
program, regardless of who provides technical and other assistance, and 
shall assure that the quality of the assistance obtained from other 
Federal, State, and local agencies, Indian tribes, and the private 
agribusiness sector is acceptable for purposes of this part. Non-NRCS 
assistance shall not be deemed to satisfy an EQIP contract entered into 
under subpart B of this part until the assistance has been approved by 
NRCS.


<R04>
                          Subpart B--Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 1466.20  Application for contracts and selecting offers from producers.

    (a) Any producer who has eligible land may submit an application for 
participation in the EQIP to a USDA service center. Producers who are 
members of a joint operation shall file a single application for the 
joint operation.
    (b) CCC will accept applications throughout the year. NRCS shall 
rank and select the offers of applicants periodically, as determined 
appropriate by NRCS after consultation with the State technical 
committee and on the recommendation of the local work groups.
    (c) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the local 
work group, will develop ranking criteria to prioritize applications 
within a priority area. NRCS shall prioritize applications from the same 
EQIP-funded priority area using the criteria specific to the area. The 
FSA county committee,

[[Page 527]]

with the assistance of the designated conservationist and the FSA county 
executive director, shall approve for funding the applications in a 
priority area based on eligibility factors of the applicant and the NRCS 
ranking.
    (d) The NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee, and using quality criteria in the NRCS field office 
technical guide, will develop criteria to prioritize applications from 
applicants with significant statewide natural resource concerns outside 
a priority area. The FSA county committee, with assistance of the 
designated conservationist and FSA county executive director, shall 
approve for funding these applications based on the eligibility factors 
of the applicant and the NRCS ranking.
    (e) The designated conservationist will work with the applicant to 
collect the information necessary to evaluate the application using the 
ranking criteria. A participant has the option of offering and accepting 
less than the maximum program payments allowed.
    (f) NRCS will rank all applications using criteria that will 
consider:
    (1) The environmental benefits per dollar expended;
    (2) A reasonable estimate of the cost of the conservation practices, 
the program payments that will be paid to the applicant, and other 
factors for determining which applications will present the least cost 
to the program;
    (3) The environmental benefits that will be derived by applying the 
conservation practices in the conservation plan which will meet the 
purposes of the program;
    (4) The extent to which the contract will assist the applicant in 
complying with Federal, State, tribal, or local environmental laws;
    (5) Whether the land in the application is located in a priority 
area and the extent to which the contract will assist the priority area 
goals and objectives.
    (g) If two or more applications have an equal rank, the application 
that will result in the least cost to the program will be given greater 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.21  Contract requirements.

    (a) In order for a participant to receive cost-share or incentive 
payments, the participant shall enter into a contract agreeing to 
implement a conservation plan or portions thereof. FSA shall determine 
the eligibility of participants. The FSA county committee, with NRCS 
concurrence, shall use the NRCS ranking consistent with the provisions 
of Sec. 1466.20 and grant final approval of a contract.
    (b) An EQIP contract shall:
    (1) Incorporate by reference all portions of a conservation plan 
applicable to EQIP;
    (2) Be for a duration of not less than 5 years nor more than 10 
years;
    (3) Incorporate all provisions as required by law or statute, 
including participant requirements to:
    (i) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch unit of concern 
that would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract;
    (ii) Refund any program payments received with interest, and forfeit 
any future payments under the program, on the violation of a term or 
condition of the contract, consistent with the provisions of 
Sec. 1466.25;
    (iii) Refund all program payments received on the transfer of the 
right and interest of the producer in land subject to the contract, 
unless the transferee of the right and interest agrees to assume all 
obligations of the contract, consistent with the provisions of 
Sec. 1466.24; and
    (iv) Supply information as required by CCC to determine compliance 
with the contract and requirements of the program.
    (4) Specify the participant's requirements for operation and 
maintenance of the applied conservation practices consistent with the 
provisions of Sec. 1466.22; and
    (5) Any other provision determined necessary or appropriate by CCC.
    (c) The participant must apply a financially assisted practice 
within the first 12 months of signing a contract.
    (d) There is a limit of one EQIP contract at any one time for each 
tract of agricultural land, as identified with a FSA tract number, 
determined at the time of the application for EQIP assistance. Subject 
to the payment limitation set out elsewhere in this part, a participant 
may have subsequent EQIP contracts for different natural resource

[[Page 528]]

needs or concerns following completion of a previous EQIP contract on 
the same tract.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.22  Conservation practice operation and maintenance.

    The contract shall incorporate the operation and maintenance of 
conservation practices applied under the contract. The participant shall 
operate and maintain the conservation practice for its intended purpose 
for the life span of the conservation practice, as identified in the 
contract or conservation plan, as determined by CCC. Conservation 
practices installed before the execution of a contract, but needed in 
the contract to obtain the environmental benefits agreed upon, are to be 
operated and maintained as specified in the contract. NRCS may 
periodically inspect the conservation practice during the life span of 
the practice as specified in the contract to ensure that operation and 
maintenance is occurring.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.23  Cost-share and incentive payments.

    (a)(1) The maximum direct Federal share of cost-share payments to a 
participant shall not be more than 75 percent of the projected cost of a 
structural or vegetative practice. The direct Federal share of cost-
share payments to a participant shall be reduced proportionately below 
75 percent, or the cost-share limit as set in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, to the extent that total financial contributions for a 
structural or vegetative practice from all public and private entity 
sources exceed 100 percent of the projected cost of the practice.
    (2) CCC shall provide incentive payments to participants for a land 
management practice in an amount and at a rate necessary to encourage a 
participant to perform the land management practice that would not 
otherwise be initiated without government assistance.
    (3) CCC shall set the cost-share and incentive payment limits, as 
determined by:
    (i) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the local 
work group and State technical committee, for a priority area; or
    (ii) The NRCS State conservationist, in consultation with the State 
technical committee, for participants subject to environmental 
requirements or with significant statewide natural resource concerns 
outside a funded priority area.
    (4) Cost-share payments and incentive payments may both be included 
in a contract.
    (5) Cost-share and incentive payments will not be made to a 
participant who has applied or initiated the application of a 
conservation practice prior to approval of the contract.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the total 
amount of cost-share and incentive payments paid to a person under this 
part may not exceed:
    (1) $10,000 for any fiscal year; and
    (2) $50,000 for any multi-year contract.
    (c) To determine eligibility for payments, CCC shall use the 
provisions in 7 CFR part 1400 related to the definition of person and 
the limitation of payments, except that:
    (1) States, political subdivisions, and entities thereof will not be 
persons eligible for payment.
    (2) For purposes of applying the payment limitations provided for in 
this section, the provisions in part 1400, subpart C for determining 
whether persons are actively engaged in farming, subpart E for limiting 
payments to certain cash rent tenants, and subpart F as the provisions 
apply to determining whether foreign persons are eligible for payment, 
will not apply.
    (3)(i) The NRCS State conservationist may authorize, on a case-by-
case basis, payments in excess of $10,000 in any fiscal year, up to the 
$50,000 limitation in paragraph (b) of this section. However, such 
increase in payments for a certain year shall be offset by reductions in 
the payments in subsequent years. A decision to approve payments in 
excess of the annual limit will consider whether:
    (A) The practices in the system need to be applied at once so that 
the system is fully functioning to resolve the natural resource problem;
    (B) The natural resource problem is so severe that resolving the 
problem immediately is needed;

[[Page 529]]

    (C) The producer needs to complete the practices in one year so that 
the farming operation is not interrupted or disturbed by the practice 
installation over a 5-10 year period; or
    (D) The producer can install the practices at a lower total cost 
when installed in one year, thereby reducing the program payments.
    (ii) With respect to land under EQIP contract which is inherited in 
the second or subsequent years of the contract, the $10,000 fiscal year 
limitation shall not apply to the extent that the payments from any 
contracts on the inherited land cause an heir, who was party to an EQIP 
contract on other lands prior to the inheritance, to exceed the annual 
limit.
    (iii) With regard to contracts on tribal land, Indian trust land, or 
BIA allotted land, payments exceeding one limitation may be made to the 
tribal venture if an official of the BIA or tribal official certifies in 
writing that no one person directly or indirectly will receive more than 
the limitation.
    (4) Any cooperative association of producers that markets 
commodities for producers shall not be considered to be a person 
eligible for payment.
    (5) The status of an individual or entity on the date of application 
shall be the basis on which the determination of the number of persons 
involved in the farming operation is made.
    (6) A participant shall not be eligible for cost-share or incentive 
payments for conservation practices on eligible land if the participant 
receives cost-share payments or other benefits for the same land under 
the Conservation Reserve Program (16 U.S.C. 3831-3836) or the Wetlands 
Reserve Program (16 U.S.C. 3837 et seq.).
    (d) The participant and NRCS must certify that a conservation 
practice is completed in accordance with the contract before the CCC 
will approve the payment of any cost-share or incentive payments.
    (e) CCC expenditures under a contract entered into during a fiscal 
year shall not be made until the subsequent fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.24  Contract modifications and transfers of land.

    (a) The participant and CCC may modify a contract if the participant 
and CCC agree to the contract modification and the conservation plan is 
revised in accordance with NRCS requirements and is approved by the 
conservation district.
    (b) The parties may agree to transfer a contract with the agreement 
of all parties to the contract. The transferee must be determined by CCC 
to be eligible and shall assume full responsibility under the contract, 
including operation and maintenance of those conservation practices 
already installed and to be installed as a condition of the contract.
    (c) CCC may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any 
assistance earned under EQIP if the participant sells or loses control 
of the land under an EQIP contract and the new owner or controller is 
not eligible to participate in the program or refuses to assume 
responsibility under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1466.25  Contract violations and termination.

    (a)(1) If CCC determines that a participant is in violation of the 
terms of a contract or documents incorporated by reference into the 
contract, CCC shall give the participant a reasonable time, as 
determined by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS, to 
correct the violation and comply with the terms of the contract and 
attachments thereto. If a participant continues in violation, the FSA 
county committee may, in consultation with NRCS, terminate the EQIP 
contract.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a contract termination shall be effective immediately upon a 
determination by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS, 
that the participant has submitted false information or filed a false 
claim, or engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for 
payments is permitted under the provisions of Sec. 1466.35, or in a case 
in which the actions of the party involved are deemed to be sufficiently 
purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.

[[Page 530]]

    (b)(1) If CCC terminates a contract, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for future payments under the contract and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received, plus interest determined in accordance 
with part 1403 of this chapter. The FSA county committee, in 
consultation with NRCS, has the option of requiring only partial refund 
of the payments received if a previously installed conservation practice 
can function independently, are not affected by the violation or other 
conservation practices that would have been installed under the 
contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain the 
installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.
    (2) If CCC terminates a contract due to breach of contract or the 
participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual 
payments have been made, the participant shall forfeit all rights for 
further payments under the contract and shall pay such liquidated 
damages as are prescribed in the contract. The FSA county committee, in 
consultation with NRCS, will have the option to waive the liquidated 
damages depending upon the circumstances of the case.
    (3) When making all contract termination decisions, CCC may reduce 
the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which 
reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the 
contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have 
prevented compliance with the contract.
    (4) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract if CCC 
agrees based on CCC's determination that termination is in the public 
interest.
    (5) In carrying out its role in this section, NRCS may consult with 
the local conservation district.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.4  Program requirements.

    (a) General. Under the WRP, the Department may purchase conservation 
easements from, or enter into restoration cost-share agreements with, 
eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate in the restoration and 
protection of wetlands and associated lands. To participate in WRP, a 
landowner will agree to the implementation of a Wetlands Reserve Plan of 
Operations (WRPO), the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, 
maintain, and manage the hydrologic conditions of inundation or 
saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of 
eligible lands. The Department may provide cost-share assistance for the 
activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management of wetland functions and values. Specific 
restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management 
actions may be undertaken by the landowner or other Department designee.
    (b) Acreage limitations. (1) Except for areas devoted to windbreaks 
or shelterbelts after November 28, 1990, no more than 25 percent of the 
total cropland in any county, as determined by the Farm Service Agency, 
may be enrolled in the CRP and the WRP, and no more than 10 percent of 
the total cropland in the county may be subject to an easement acquired 
under the CRP and the WRP.
    (2) The Department and the Farm Service Agency shall concur before a 
waiver of either the 25 percent limit or the 10 percent limit of this 
subsection can be approved for an easement proposed for enrollment in 
the WRP. Such a waiver will only be approved if it will not adversely 
affect the local economy, and operators in the county are having 
difficulties complying with the conservation plans implemented under 16 
U.S.C. 3812.
    (c) Landowner eligibility. The Department may determine that a 
person is not eligible to participate in the WRP or receive any WRP 
payment because the person did not comply with the provisions of 7 CFR 
part 12. To be eligible to enroll an easement in the WRP, a person must:
    (1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is 
sought;
    (2) Have been the landowner of such land for the 12 months prior to 
the time the intention to participate is declared unless it is 
determined by the State Conservationist that the land was acquired by 
will or succession as a result of the death of the previous landowner, 
or that adequate assurances have been presented to the State 
Conservationist that the new landowner of such land did not acquire such 
land for the purpose of placing it in the WRP; and
    (3) Agree to provide such information to the Department as the 
agency deems necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of 
eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation 
purposes.
    (d) Eligible land. (1) The Department shall determine whether land 
is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands 
may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful 
restoration of wetland functions and values when considering the cost of 
acquiring the easement and restoration, protection, enhancement, 
maintenance, and management costs.

[[Page 535]]

    (2) Land shall only be considered eligible for enrollment in the WRP 
if the Department determines, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, that:
    (i) Such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and 
functions;
    (ii) The likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and 
the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the 
program, taking into consideration the cost of such restoration; and
    (iii) Such land meets the criteria of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) The following land may be eligible for enrollment in the WRP, 
which land may be identified by the Department pursuant to regulations 
and implementing policies pertaining to wetland conservation found at 7 
CFR part 12, as:
    (i) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions, farmed wetlands, prior 
converted cropland, commenced conversion wetlands, farmed wetland 
pastures, and lands substantially altered by flooding so as to develop 
wetland functions and values;
    (ii) Former or degraded wetlands that occur on lands that have been 
used or are currently being used for the production of food and fiber, 
including rangeland and forest production lands, where the hydrology has 
been significantly degraded or modified and will be substantially 
restored;
    (iii) Riparian areas along streams or other waterways that link or, 
after restoring the riparian area, will link wetlands which are 
protected by an easement or other device or circumstance that achieves 
the same objectives as an easement:
    (iv) Land adjacent to the restored wetland which would contribute 
significantly to wetland functions and values including buffer areas, 
wetland creations, and non-cropped natural wetlands, but not more than 
the State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical 
Committee, determines is necessary for such contribution;
    (v) Other wetlands that would not otherwise be eligible but would 
significantly add to the wetland functions and values; and
    (vi) Wetlands that have been restored under a private, State, or 
Federal restoration program with an easement or deed restriction with a 
duration of less than 30 years.
    (4) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must be configured 
in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management of 
the area for easement purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program 
objectives.
    (e) Ineligible land. The following land is not eligible for 
enrollment in the WRP:
    (1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was commended after 
December 23, 1985;
    (2) Land that contains timber stands established under a CRP 
contract or pasture land established to trees under a CRP contract.
    (3) Lands owned by an agency of the United States;
    (4) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction with a duration 
of 30 years or more prohibiting the production of agricultural 
commodities; and,
    (5) Lands where implementation of restoration practices would be 
futile due to on-site or off-site conditions.
    (f) Enrollment of CRP lands. Land subject to an existing CRP 
contract may be enrolled into the WRP only if the land and landowner 
meet the requirements of this part, and the enrollment is requested by 
the landowner and agreed to by the Department. To enroll in WRP, the CRP 
contract for the property shall be terminated or otherwise modified 
subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon by the 
Farm Service Agency and the landowner.

amended at 61 FR 42141, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.5  Application procedures.

    (a) Application for participation. To apply for enrollment, a 
landowner must submit an Application for Participation in the WRP. The 
application must be submitted during an announced period for such 
submissions.
    (b) Preliminary agency actions. By filing an Application for 
Participation, the landowner consents to a Department representative 
entering upon the

[[Page 536]]

land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions and values, and for 
other activities such as the development of the preliminary WRPO that 
are necessary or desirable for the Department to make offers of 
enrollment. The landowner is entitled to accompany a Department 
representative on any site visits.
    (c) Voluntary reduction in compensation. In order to enhance the 
probability of enrollment in WRP, a landowner may voluntarily offer to 
accept a lesser payment than is being offered by the Department.

[60 FR 28514, June 1, 1995. Redesignated and amended at 61 FR 42141, 
42143, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.6  Establishing priority for enrollment of properties in WRP.

    (a) The Department shall place priority on the enrollment of those 
lands that will maximize wildlife values (especially related to 
enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife); have the 
least likelihood of re-conversion and loss of these wildlife values at 
the end of the WRP enrollment period; and that involve State, local, or 
other partnership matching funds and participation.
    (b) Ranking considerations. Based on applications for participation, 
the State Conservationist, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and the State Technical Committee, will rank properties 
based on: estimated costs of restoration and easement acquisition, 
availability of matching funds, significance of wetland functions and 
values, estimated success of restoration measures, and the duration of a 
proposed easement with permanent easements being given priority over 
non-permanent easements.
    (c) The Department may place higher priority on certain geographic 
regions of the State where restoration of wetlands may better achieve 
Department State and regional goals and objectives.
    (d) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, the State 
Conservationist may enroll eligible lands at any time in order to 
encompass total wetland areas subject to multiple ownership or otherwise 
to achieve program objectives. Similarly, the State Conservationist may, 
at any time, exclude otherwise eligible lands if the participation of 
the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of 
the wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling to participate.

[60 FR 28514, June 1, 1995. Redesignated and amended at 61 FR 42141, 
42142, Aug. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1467.7  Enrollment of easements.

    (a) Offers of enrollment. Based on the priority ranking, the 
Department will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance 
into the program for which the landowner has 15 calendar days to sign a 
letter of intent to continue. Department will select lands to maximize 
environmental benefits per expenditure of Federal funds.
    (b) Effect of letter of intent to continue (enrollment). An offer of 
tentative acceptance into the program does not bind the Department or 
the United States to acquire an easement, nor does it bind the landowner 
to convey an easement or agree to WRPO activities. However, receipt of 
an executed letter of intent to continue will authorize the Department 
to proceed.
    (c) Acceptance of offer of enrollment. A contract will be presented 
by the Department to the landowner, which will describe the easement 
area; the easement terms and conditions; and other terms and conditions 
for participation that may be required by the Department. A landowner 
accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing contract.
    (d) Effect of the acceptance of the offer. After the contract is 
executed by Department and the landowner, the Department will proceed 
with various easement acquisition activities, which may include 
conducting a survey of the easement area, securing necessary 
subordination agreements, procuring title insurance, and conducting 
other activities necessary to record the easement or implement the WRPO.
    (e) Withdrawal of offers. Prior to execution by the United States 
and the landowner of the contract, the Department may withdraw its offer 
anytime due to availability of funds, inability to clear title, or other 
reasons. The offer to the landowner shall be void if not executed by the 
landowner within the time specified. The date of the offer

[[Page 537]]

shall be the date of notification to the landowner of tentative

Sec. 1467.8  Compensation for easements.

    (a) Establishment of rates. (1) The State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, shall determine 
easement payment rates to be applied to specific geographic areas within 
the State or to individual easement areas.
    (2) In order to provide for better uniformity among States, the 
Regional Conservationist and Chief may review and adjust, as 
appropriate, State or other geographically based easement payment rates.
    (b) Determination of easement payment rates. (1) Easement payment 
rates will be based upon analyses of the values of the lands when used 
for agricultural purposes. The landowner will receive the lesser of the 
following:
    (i) the geographic area rate;
    (ii) the value based on a market appraisal analysis/assessment; or
    (iii) the landowner offer.
    (2) Each State Conservationist will determine the easement payment 
rates using the best information which is readily available in that 
State for assessing the values of land for agricultural purposes. Such 
information may include: soil types, type(s) of crops capable of being 
grown, production history, location, real estate market values, 
appraisals and market analyses, and tax rates and assessments. The State 
Conservationist may consult with other Federal agencies, real estate 
market experts, appraisers, local tax authorities, and other entities or 
persons which may provide information on productivity and market 
conditions.
    (3) Easement payments for non-permanent easements will be less than 
those for permanent easements because the quality and duration of the 
ecological benefits derived from a non-permanent easement are 
significantly less than those derived from a permanent easement on the 
same land. Additionally, the economic value of the easement interests 
being acquired is less for a non-permanent easement than that associated 
with a permanent easement. An easement payment for the short-term 30-
year easement shall not be less than 50 percent nor more than 75 percent 
of that which would have been paid for a permanent easement.
    (c) Maximum payments. In order to ensure that limited program funds 
are expended to maximize program benefits, the State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish a maximum 
easement payment for any one easement within a State or for geographic 
areas within a State.
    (d) Preliminary estimates of easement payments. Upon request of the 
landowner prior to filing an application for enrollment, a landowner may 
be appraised of the maximum easement payment rates.
    (e) Acceptance of offered easement compensation. (1) The Department 
will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of 
the easement payment which is offered by the Department. The easement 
payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and 
rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement. By 
voluntarily participating in the program, a landowner waives any claim 
to additional compensation based on fair market value.
    (2) Annual easement payments may be made in no less than 5 annual 
payments and no more than 30 annual payments of equal or unequal size.
    (f) Reimbursement of a landowner's expenses. For completed easement 
conveyances, the Department will reimburse landowners for their fair and 
reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for surveying and related costs, 
as determined by the Department. The State Conservationist, in 
consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish maximum 
payments to reimburse landowners for reasonable expenses.
    (g) Tax implications of easement conveyances. Subject to applicable 
regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, a landowner may be eligible 
for a bargain sale tax deduction which is the difference between the 
fair market value of the easement conveyed to the United States and the 
easement payment made to the landowner. The Department disclaims any 
representations concerning the tax implications

[[Page 538]]

of any easement or cost-share transaction.
    (h) Payment limitation on non-permanent easements. With respect to 
non-permanent easements, the annual amount of easement payments to any 
person may not exceed $50,000 except for:
    (1) Payments made pursuant to projects involving partnership funding 
or participation; or
    (2) Payment received by a State, political subdivision, or agency 
thereof in connection with agreements entered into under a special 
wetland and environmental enhancement program carried out by that entity 
that has been approved by Department.
    (i) If easement payments are calculated on a per acre basis, 
adjustment to stated easement payment will be made based on final 
determination of acreage.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.9  Cost-share payments.

    (a) The Department may share the cost with landowners of restoring 
the enrolled land as provided in the WRPO. The amount and terms and 
conditions of the cost-share assistance shall be subject to the 
following restrictions on the costs of establishing or installing 
practices specified in the WRPO:
    (1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement, the Department 
shall offer to pay not less than 75 percent nor more than 100 percent of 
such costs; and
    (2) On enrolled land subject to a non-permanent easement or 
restoration cost-share agreement, the Department shall offer to pay not 
less than 50 percent nor more than 75 percent of such costs. Restoration 
cost-share payments offered by Department for the short-term, 30-year 
easements shall be 50 to 75 percent.
    (b) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by the 
Department that an eligible practice or an identifiable unit of the 
practice has been established in compliance with appropriate standards 
and specifications. Identified practices may be implemented by the 
landowner or other designee.
    (c) Cost-share payments may be made for the establishment and 
installation of additional eligible practices, or the maintenance or 
replacement of an eligible practice, but only if Department determines 
the practice is needed to meet the objectives of the easement, and the 
failure of the original practices was due to reasons beyond the control 
of the landowner.
    (d) A landowner may seek additional cost-share assistance from other 
public or private organizations as long as the activities funded are in 
compliance with this part. In no event shall the landowner receive an 
amount which exceeds 100 percent of the total actual cost of the 
restoration.

<R05>
Sec. 1467.12  Modifications.

    (a) Easements. (1) After an easement has been recorded, no 
modification will be made in the easement except by mutual agreement 
with the Chief and the landowner. The Chief will consult with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and the Conservation District prior to making 
any modifications to easements.
    (2) Approved modifications will be made only in an amended easement 
which is duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real 
estate practices, including requirements for title approval, 
subordination of liens, and recordation.
    (3) The Chief may approve modifications to facilitate the practical 
administration and management of the easement area or the program so 
long as the modification will not adversely affect the wetland functions 
and values for which the easement was acquired.
    (4) Modifications must result in equal or greater environmental and 
economic values to the United States.
    (b) WRPO. Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable 
law, the State Conservationist may approve modifications to the WRPO 
that do not affect provisions of the easement in consultation with the 
landowner and the State Technical Committee and following consideration 
of site specific technical input from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and the Conservation District. Any WRPO modification must meet WRP 
program objectives, and must result in equal or greater wildlife 
benefits, wetland functions and values, ecological and economic values 
to the United States. Modifications to the WRPO which are substantial 
and affect provisions of the easement will require agreement from the 
landowner and require execution of an amended easement.

more restrictive easement and contract terms and conditions.
    (b) Payments to landowners. (1) For easements with multiple annual 
payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original 
landowner unless the Department receives an assignment of proceeds.
    (2) The new landowner or purchaser shall be held responsible for 
assuring completion of all measures and practices required by the 
contract. Eligible cost-share payments shall be made to the new 
landowner upon presentation of an assignment of rights or other evidence 
that title had passed.
    (c) Claims to payments. With respect to any and all payments owed to 
landowners, the United States shall bear no responsibility for any full 
payments or partial distributions of funds between the original 
landowner and the landowner's successor. In the event of a dispute or 
claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, the Department may 
withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement 
or adjudication on the rights to the funds.

directly involving the landowner, the landowner shall be given 
reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the 
violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional 
time as the State Conservationist may allow.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Department

costs incurred by the United States as a result of the landowner's 
negligence or failure to comply with easement or contractual 
obligations.
    (c) In addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies as may 
be available to the United States under applicable law, the Department 
may withhold any easement and cost-share payments owing to landowners at 
any time there is a material breach of the easement covenants or any 
contract. Such withheld funds may be used to offset costs incurred by 
the United States in any remedial actions or retained as damages 
pursuant to court order or settlement agreement.
    (d) The United States shall be entitled to recover any and all 
administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, 
associated with any enforcement or remedial action.

Sec. 1468.1  Purpose.

    (a) Through the Conservation Farm Option (CFO), the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC) provides financial assistance to eligible farmers and 
ranchers to address soil, water, and related natural resource concerns, 
water quality protection or improvement; wetland restoration and 
protection; wildlife habitat development and protection; and other 
similar conservation purposes on their lands in an environmentally 
beneficial and cost-effective manner. The Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS) may provide technical assistance, upon request by the 
producer or landowner.
    (b) The CCC provides a single contract and annual payments for 
implementation of innovative and environmentally-sound methods for 
addressing natural resource concerns for producers of wheat, feed 
grains, cotton, and rice, resulting in consolidation of payments that 
would have been available under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), 
the Wetlands Reserve Program cost-share agreements (WRP), and the 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). CFO participation is 
determined through two step

[[Page 542]]

process: first, the Chief, with FSA concurrence, selects CFO pilot 
project areas based on proposals submitted by the public; then CCC 
accepts applications from eligible producers or owners within the 
selected pilot project area.

    (b) Participation in the CFO is limited to producers of wheat, feed 
grains, cotton, or rice who have a production flexibility contract, in 
accordance with part 1412 of this chapter, on the farm enrolling in CFO 
and who are eligible for either CRP (7 CFR part 1410), EQIP (7 CFR part 
1466), or WRP (7 CFR part 1467).
    (c) The participant is responsible for the development of a 
conservation farm plan for the farm or ranch and may request assistance 
from NRCS or a third party in writing both the conservation farm plan 
and installing the practices outlined within the plan. Conservation 
practices in the conservation farm plan that would have been eligible 
for payment under CRP, EQIP, or cost-share agreements under WRP are 
eligible for CFO payment. The provisions for determining eligibility for 
payment and the calculation of payment under CFO will be similar to 
those specified for the eligible conservation practices under CRP, EQIP, 
or cost-share agreements under WRP. For land retirement payments, the 
CRP payment schedule in effect for the applicable soils at the time the 
CFO contract is signed will be utilized. CCC will provide annual 
payments to a participant for such conservation practices as specified 
in the time schedule set forth in the conservation farm plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.6  Practice eligibility provisions.

    (a) Practices may be eligible for payment under CFO if the 
conservation practice specified in the conservation farm plan is 
determined to be an eligible practice, as determined by the Chief, in 
accordance with:
    (1) 7 CFR part 1410 for land retirement rental payments and 
practices that are eligible under CRP;
    (2) 7 CFR part 1467 for wetland restoration or protection practices 
that are eligible under WRP; or
    (3) 7 CFR part 1466 for conservation practices that are eligible 
under EQIP.

[[Page 545]]

    (b) For practices that are installed on retired land, the CRP cost-
share rate for practices must be utilized.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.7  Participant eligibility provisions.

    Participants in the CFO must at the time of enrollment:
    (a) Have a production flexibility contract in accordance with part 
1412 of this chapter on the farm enrolling in CFO.
    (b) Agree to forgo earning future payments under the Conservation 
Reserve Program authorized by part 1410 of this chapter, the Wetlands 
Reserve Program cost-share payments authorized by part 1467 of this 
chapter, and Environmental Quality Incentives Program authorized by part 
1466 of this chapter, on the farm enrolled in the CFO for the term of 
the CFO contract.
    (c) Be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland 
conservation provisions found at part 12 of this title;
    (d) Have control of the land for the term of the proposed contract 
period;
    (1) An exception may be made by the Chief in the case of land 
allotted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), tribal land, or other 
instances in which the Chief determines that there is sufficient 
assurance of control.
    (2) If the applicant is a tenant of the land involved in 
agricultural production the applicant shall provide CCC with the written 
authorization by the landowner to apply the structural or vegetative 
practice.
    (3) If the applicant is a landowner, the landowner is presumed to 
have control.
    (e) Submit a proposed conservation farm plan to CCC that is in 
compliance with the terms and conditions of the program. To receive 
payment under the CFO, the participant must also meet the eligibility 
requirements, as determined by the Chief, in:
    (1) 7 CFR part 1410 if the land retirement rental payment and 
practice determined eligible in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(a);
    (2) 7 CFR part 1467 if the wetland restoration or protection 
practice was determined eligible in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(b), or
    (3) 7 CFR part 1466, if the conservation practice was determined 
eligible in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(c).
    (4) Comply with the provisions at Sec. 1412.304 of this chapter for 
protecting the interests of tenants and sharecroppers, including 
provisions for sharing, on a fair and equitable basis, payments made 
available under this part, as may be applicable.
    (5) Supply information as required by CCC to determine eligibility 
for the program.
    (6) Comply with all the provisions of the CFO contract which 
includes the conservation farm plan approved by the local conservation

<R05>
Sec. 1468.8  Land eligibility provisions.

    Land may be eligible for enrollment in CFO, if CCC determines that 
the farm or ranch is enrolled in a production flexibility contract, 
authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Transition Act of 1996 and if 
the land upon which the CFO conservation practice, will be applied is 
determined to be eligible land as determined by the Chief, in accordance 
with:
    (a) 7 CFR part 1410, if the practice was determined an eligible land 
retirement rental payment and cost-share practice similar to CRP in 
accordance with Sec. 1468.6(a);
    (b) 7 CFR part 1467, if the practice was determined an eligible 
wetland restoration or protection practice similar to WRP in accordance 
with Sec. 1468.6(b); or
    (c) 7 CFR part 1466, if the practice was determined an eligible 
conservation practice similar to EQIP in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(c).


<R05>
Sec. 1468.9  Conservation farm plan.

    (a) The conservation farm plan forms the basis of the CFO contract. 
Prior to contract approval, a conservation farm plan must be written and 
approved. In deciding whether to approve a conservation farm plan, CCC 
may consider whether:
    (1) The participant will use conservation practices to solve the 
natural resource concerns that will maximize environmental benefits per 
dollar expended, and
    (2) The conservation practice would have been eligible for 
enrollment in the

[[Page 546]]

CRP, EQIP, or under the WRP cost-share agreements.
    (b) The conservation farm plan for the farm or ranch unit of concern 
shall:
    (1) Describe any resource conserving crop rotation, and all other 
conservation practices, to be implemented and maintained on the acreage 
that is subject to contract during the contact period;
    (2) Address the resource concerns identified in the CFO pilot 
project area proposal;
    (3) Contain a schedule for the implementation and maintenance of the 
practices described in the conservation farm plan;
    (4) Ensure that net environmental benefits under a CRP contract are 
maintained or exceeded for the whole farm, as constituted by FSA, when 
terminating a CRP contract and enrolling in a CFO contract; and
    (5) Meet the objectives of the pilot project area.
    (c) The conservation farm plan is part of the CFO contract.
    (d) The conservation farm plan must allow the participant to achieve 
a cost-effective resource management system, or some appropriate portion 
of that system, identified in the applicable NRCS field office technical 
guide or as approved by the State Conservationist.
    (e) Participants are responsible for implementing the conservation 
farm plan in compliance with this part.
    (f) Upon a participant's request, the NRCS may provide technical 
assistance to a participant.
    (1) Participants may, at their own cost, use qualified 
professionals, other than NRCS personnel, to provide technical 
assistance. NRCS retains approval authority over the technical adequacy 
of work done by non-NRCS personnel for the purpose of determining CFO 
contract compliance.
    (2) Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel 
not affiliated with NRCS may include, but not limited to: conservation 
planning; conservation practice survey, layout, design, and 
installation; information, education, and training for producers; and 
training and quality assurance for professional conservationists.
    (g) All conservation practices scheduled in the conservation farm 
plan are to be carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS Field 
Office Technical Guide. The State Conservationist may approve use of 
innovative conservation measures that are not contained in the NRCS 
Field Office Technical Guide.
    (h)(1) To simplify the conservation planning process for the 
participant, the conservation farm plan may be developed, at the request 
of the participant, as a single plan that incorporates, other Federal, 
state, Tribal, or local government program or regulatory requirements. 
CCC development or approval of a conservation farm plan shall not 
constitute compliance with program, statutory and regulatory 
requirements administered or enforced by a non-USDA agency, except as 
agreed to by the participant and the relevant Federal, state, local or 
tribal entities.
    (2) CCC may accept an existing conservation plan developed and 
required for participation in any other CCC or USDA program if the 
conservation plan otherwise meets the requirements of this part. When a 
participant develops a single conservation farm plan for more than one 
program, the participant shall clearly identify the portions of the plan 
that are applicable to the CFO contract. It is the responsibility of the 
participant to ascertain and comply with all applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements.

                          Subpart B--Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 1468.20  Application for CFO program participation.

    (a) Any eligible owner or producer within an approved pilot project 
area may submit an application for participation in the CFO to a service 
center or other USDA county or field office(s) of FSA or NRCS, where the 
pilot project area is located.
    (b) CCC will accept applications throughout the fiscal year. CCC 
will rank and select the offers of applicants periodically, as 
determined appropriate by the State Conservationist. The application 
period will begin after a pilot project area has been approved.
    (c) The designated conservationist, in consultation with the local 
work group, will develop ranking criteria to

[[Page 547]]

prioritize applications within a pilot project area which consists of 
more than one owner or producer. NRCS will prioritize applications from 
the same pilot project area using the criteria specific to the area. The 
FSA county committee, with the assistance of the designated 
conservationist and designated FSA official, will approve for funding 
the application in a pilot project area based on eligibility factors of 
the applicant and the NRCS ranking.
    (d) The designated conservationist will work with the applicant to 
collect the information necessary to evaluate the application using the 
ranking criteria. An applicant has the option of offering and accepting 
less than the maximum program payments allowed, offering to apply more 
conservation practices to the land in order to increase the likelihood 
of being enrolled. In evaluating the applications, the designated 
conservationist will take into consideration the following factors:
    (1) Soil erosion;
    (2) Water quality;
    (3) Wildlife benefits;
    (4) Soil productivity;
    (5) Conservation compliance considerations;
    (6) Likelihood to remain in conserving uses beyond the contract 
period, including tree planting and permanent wildlife habitat;
    (7) State water quality priority areas;
    (8) The environmental benefits per dollar expended; and
    (9) The degree to which application is consistent with the pilot 
project proposal.
    (e) If two or more applications have an equal rank, the application 
that will result in the least cost to the program will be given greater 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.21  Contract requirements.

    (a) In order for an applicant to receive annual payments, the 
applicant must enter into a contract agreeing to implement a 
conservation farm plan. The FSA county committee, with NRCS concurrence, 
will use the NRCS ranking consistent with the provisions of Sec. 1468.20 
and grant final approval of the contract.
    (b) A CFO contract will:
    (1) Incorporate by reference all portions of a conservation farm 
plan applicable to CFO;
    (2) Be for a duration of 10 years, and may be renewed, subject to 
the availability of funds, for a period not to exceed 5 years upon 
mutual agreement of CCC and the participant;
    (3) Provide that the participant will:
    (i) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch unit of concern 
consistent with the goals of the contract that would tend to defeat the 
purposes of the contract, or reduce net environmental and societal 
benefits;
    (ii) Refund with interest any program payments received and forfeit 
any future payments under the program, on the violation of a term or 
condition of the contract, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1468.25 of this part;
    (iii) Refund all program payments received on the transfer of the 
right and interest of the producer in land subject to the contract, 
unless the transferee of the right and interest agrees to assume all 
obligations of the contract, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1468.24 of this part;
    (iv) Agree to forego participation in CRP, EQIP, and the cost-share 
agreements under WRP, along with future payments associated with these 
programs, with regard to the land under the CFO contract;
    (v) Supply information as required by CCC to determine compliance 
with the contract and requirements of the program;
    (4) Specify the participant's requirements for operation and 
maintenance of the applied conservation practices in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1468.22 of this part, and
    (5) Include any other provision determined necessary or appropriate 
by CCC.
    (c) There is a limit of one CFO contract at any one time for each 
farm, as constituted by FSA.
    (d) The contract will incorporate the operation and maintenance of 
conservation practices applied under the contract, including those 
practices transferred from terminated CRP and EQIP contracts and WRP 
cost-share agreements. For persons wishing to transfer from CRP, EQIP, 
or WRP to CFO, practices included in CRP or

[[Page 548]]

EQIP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements must be included in a CFO 
contract if an owner or producer wishes to participate, unless otherwise 
stated in the conservation farm plan.
    (e) Acreage that is subject to a WRP easement will not be included 
in the CFO contract.
    (f) Upon completion, the participant must certify that a 
conservation practice is completed in accordance with the conservation 
farm plan to establish compliance with the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.22  Conservation practice operation and maintenance.

    (a) The participant will operate and maintain the conservation 
practice for its intended purpose for the life span of the conservation 
practice, as identified in the conservation farm plan. Conservation 
practices installed before the execution of a CFO contract, but needed 
in the contract to obtain the environmental benefits agreed upon, are to 
be operated and maintained as specified in the contract. NRCS may 
periodically inspect the conservation practice during the lifespan of 
the practice as specified in the contract to ensure that the operation 
and maintenance is occurring.
    (b) For those persons who are signatories to existing CRP or EQIP 
contracts, or WRP cost-share agreements, practices will be transferred 
from EQIP and CRP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements, as agreed upon 
in the CFO conservation farm plan and CFO contract. Remaining rights and 
obligations under CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be incorporated into the new 
CFO contract. Practices included in CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be 
incorporated into the new CFO contract. Practices included in CRP or 
EQIP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements must be included in a CFO 
contract if an owner or producer wishes to participate. Participants in 
CFO with CRP, EQIP, or WRP practices incorporated into CFO contracts are 
responsible for operating and maintaining these practices for the 
balance of the period specified in the original program contract, unless 
otherwise stated in the conservation farm plan and CFO contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.23  Annual payments.

    (a) CCC will determine annual payments, subject to the availability 
of funds, based on the value of the expected payments that would have 
been paid to the participant for that practice as specified in:
    (1) Part 1410 of this chapter, if the practice is a land retirement 
rental payment or cost-share practice which would have qualified for 
payment under CRP in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(a);
    (2) Part 1467 of this chapter, if the practice is a wetland 
restoration or protection practice which would have qualified for 
payment under WRP which was determined eligible in accordance with 
Sec. 1468.6(b);
    (3) Part 1466 of this chapter, if the practice was a conservation 
practice which would have qualified for payment under EQIP which was 
determined eligible in accordance with Sec. 1468.6(c);
    (b) The maximum amount of annual payments which a person may receive 
under the CFO for any fiscal year shall not exceed the total of the 
amounts calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section 
after being limited as follows:
    (1) The payment calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section is limited in accordance with CRP payment limitation 
provisions set forth in part 1410 of this chapter.
    (2) The payment calculated in accordance with Sec. 1467.9(a)(2) of 
this chapter is not limited.
    (3) The payment calculated in accordance with Sec. 1466.23(a)(3) of 
this chapter is limited in accordance with EQIP payment limitation 
provisions in Sec. 1466.23(b) of this chapter.
    (c) The regulations set forth at part 1400 of this chapter will be 
applicable in making payment eligibility determinations for CFO and in 
making person determination as they apply to the limitation of payments 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The CCC cost-share payments to a participant shall be reduced so 
that total financial contributions for a structural or vegetative 
practice from all public and private entity sources do not exceed the 
cost of the practice.

[[Page 549]]

    (e) A landowner or producer that enrolls in CFO and terminates a CRP 
or EQIP contract or WRP cost-share agreement will be eligible to receive 
payments for practices which have been determined, established, or 
completed by the technical agency under those contracts or agreements. 
Once the CFO contract is effective, all payments for practices, 
including any practice transferred from the terminated contract 
agreement will be made under the CFO contract, except for payments 
already earned under prior contracts or cost-share agreements.
    (f) Payments will not be made to a participant who has applied or 
initiated the application of a conservation practice for the purposes of 
CFO prior to approval of the CFO contract.
    (g) When requested by the State Conservationist on a case-by-case 
basis, the Chief may approve, based upon availability of funding, cost 
share on the reapplication of a practice to replace or repair practice 
destroyed by unusual circumstances beyond the control of the landowner.
    (h) The participant and NRCS must certify that a conservation 
practice is completed in accordance with the conservation farm plan to 
establish compliance with the contract before the CCC will approve the 
payment of any cost-share, incentive, or land retirement payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.24  Contract modifications and transfers of land.

    (a) The participant and CCC may modify a contract if the participant 
and CCC agree to the contract modification and the conservation farm 
plan is revised in accordance with CCC requirements and is approved by 
the conservation district.
    (b) The participant may agree to transfer a contract to another 
eligible owner or operator with the agreement of CCC. The transferee 
shall assume full responsibility under the contract, including operation 
and maintenance of those conservation practices already installed and to 
be installed as a condition of the contract. By agreeing to participate 
in CFO, CCC may require operation and maintenance of those conservation 
practices installed under CRP, EQIP, or WRP.
    (c) CCC may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any 
assistance earned under a CRP or EQIP contract, or WRP cost-share 
agreement that was terminated as a condition of participation in CFO, if 
the participant sells or loses control of the land under a CFO contract 
and the new owner or controller does not assume responsibility under the 
contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.25  Contract violations and termination.

    (a)(1) If it is determined that a participant is in violation of the 
provisions of this part, or the terms of the contract including portions 
of the contract that incorporate transferred obligations from CRP or 
EQIP contracts, or WRP cost-share agreements, CCC will give the 
participant written notice of a reasonable time to correct the violation 
and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto, as 
determined by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS. If a 
participant continues in violation after the time to comply has elapsed, 
the FSA county committee may, in consultation with NRCS, terminate the 
CFO contract.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a contract termination shall be effective immediately upon a 
determination by the FSA county committee, in consultation with NRCS, 
that the participant has submitted false information, filed a false 
claim, or engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for 
payments is permitted under the provisions of Sec. 1468.35 of this part, 
or in a case in which the actions of the party involved are deemed to be 
sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without 
delay.
    (b)(1) If CCC terminates a contract, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for future payments under the contract and shall refund all 
or part of the payments received, plus interest, determined in 
accordance with part 1403 of this chapter. CCC has the option of 
requiring only partial refund of the payments received if a previously 
installed conservation practice can function independently, is not 
affected by the violation or other conservation practices that would 
have been installed

[[Page 550]]

under the contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain 
the installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.
    (2) If CCC terminates a contract for any reason stated above, before 
any contractual payments have been made, the participant shall forfeit 
all rights for further payments under the contract and shall pay such 
liquidated damages as are prescribed in the contract.
    (3) When making all contract termination decisions, CCC may reduce 
the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which 
reflects the good-faith effort of the participant to comply with the 
contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have 
prevented compliance with the contract.
    (4) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract without 
penalty, if CCC determines that such termination would be in the public 
interest.


<R04>
                    Subpart C--General Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1468.30  Appeals.

    (a) An applicant or participant may obtain administrative review of 
an adverse decision made with respect to this part and the CFO contract 
in accordance with parts 11 and 614 of this title, except as provided in

<R05>
Sec. 1468.32  Access to operating unit.

    Any authorized CCC representative shall have the right to enter an 
operating unit or tract for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of 
any representations made in a contract or in anticipation of entering a 
contract, or as to the performance of the terms and conditions of the 
contract. Access shall include the right to provide technical assistance 
and inspect any work undertaken under the contract. The CCC 
representative shall make a reasonable effort to contact the participant 
prior to the exercise of this right to access.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.33  Performance based upon advice or action of representatives of CCC.

    If a participant relied upon the advice or action of any authorized 
representative of CCC, and did not know or have reason to know that the 
action or advice was improper or erroneous, the FSA county committee, in 
consultation with NRCS, may accept the advice or action as meeting the 
requirements of the program and may grant relief, to the extent it is 
deemed desirable, to provide a fair and equitable treatment because of 
the good-faith reliance on the part of the participant.


<R05>
Sec. 1468.34  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof to any participant shall be made without regard to 
questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or 
lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any 
other creditor except agencies of the United States. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found at part 1403 of this chapter 
shall apply to contract payments.
    (b) Any participant entitled to any payment may assign any payments 
in accordance with regulations governing assignment of payment found at 
part 1404 of this chapter.

[[Page 551]]


<R05>
Sec. 1468.35  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A participant who is determined to have erroneously represented 
any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this 
part shall not be entitled to contract payments and must refund to CCC 
all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of 
this chapter.
    (b) An applicant or participant who is determined to have knowingly 
adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the 
program; made any fraudulent representation; or misrepresented any fact 
affecting a program determination, shall refund to CCC all payments, 
plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, 
received by such applicant or participant with respect to CFO contracts.

                    Subpart B--Market Access Program


<R05>
Sec. 1485.10  General purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the policies underlying the Commodity 
Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Market Access Program (MAP), 
and a subcomponent of that program, the Export Incentive Program/Market 
Access Program (EIP/MAP). It also establishes the general terms and 
conditions applicable to MAP and EIP/MAP agreements.
    (b) Under the MAP, CCC enters into agreements with nonprofit trade 
organizations to share the costs of certain overseas marketing and 
promotion activities that are intended to develop, maintain or expand 
commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and 
products. MAP participants may receive assistance for either generic or 
brand promotion activities. EIP/MAP participants are U.S. commercial 
entities that receive assistance for brand promotion activities.
    (c) The MAP and EIP/MAP generally operate on a reimbursement basis, 
and CCC may, at its option, provide such reimbursement either in cash or 
in CCC commodity certificates.
    (d) CCC's policy is to ensure that benefits generated by MAP and 
EIP/MAP agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant 
agricultural sector and no one entity gains an undue advantage. The MAP 
and EIP/MAP are administered by personnel of the Foreign Agricultural 
Service.


<R05>
Sec. 1485.11  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart the following definitions apply:
    Activity--a specific market development effort undertaken by a 
participant.
    Activity plan--a document which details a participant's proposed 
activities and budget. (Activity plan is used in lieu of the term

Sec. 1485.14  Application approval and formation of agreements.

    (a) General. CCC will, consistent with available resources, approve 
those applications which it considers to present the best opportunity 
for developing, maintaining or expanding export markets for U.S. 
agricultural commodities. The selection process, by its nature, involves 
the exercise of judgment. CCC's choice of participants and proposed 
promotion projects requires that it consider and weigh a number of 
factors that cannot be mathematically measured--i.e., market 
opportunity, market strategy and management capability.
    (b) Approval criteria. In assessing the applications it receives and 
determining which it will approve, CCC considers the following criteria:
    (1) The effectiveness of program management;
    (2) Soundness of accounting procedures;
    (3) The nature of the applicant organization, with greater weight 
given to those organizations with the broadest base of producer 
representation;
    (4) Prior export promotion or direct export experience;
    (5) Previous MAP funding;
    (6) Adequacy of the applicant's strategic plan in the following 
categories:
    (i) Description of market conditions;
    (ii) Description of, and plan for addressing, market constraints;
    (iii) Reasonable likelihood of plan success;
    (iv) Export volume and value and market share goals in each country;
    (v) Description of evaluation plan and suitability of the plan for 
performance measurement; and
    (vi) Past program results and evaluations, if applicable.
    (c) Allocation factors. After determining which applications to 
approve, CCC determines how it will allocate resources among 
participants based on the following factors, in addition to those in 
paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Size of the budget request in relation to projected value of 
exports;
    (2) Where applicable, size of the budget request in relation to 
actual value of exports in prior years;
    (3) Where applicable, participant's past projections of exports 
compared with actual exports;
    (4) Level of participant's, State's, and industry's contributions;
    (5) Market share goals in target country(ies);
    (6) The degree to which the product to be exported consists of U.S. 
grown agricultural commodities;
    (7) The degree of value-added processing in the U.S.; and
    (8) General administrative and overhead costs compared to direct 
promotional costs.
    (9) In the case of a brand promotion program, the percentage of the 
budget that will be made available to small-sized entities as a means of 
providing priority assistance to such entities.
    (d) Approval decision. (1) CCC will approve those applications which 
it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified above. In 
addition, CCC will only approve applications for EIP/MAP when there is 
sufficient U.S. industry need for a brand promotion and there is no 
eligible MAP participant interested in or capable of undertaking the 
brand promotion.
    (2) CCC will not provide assistance to a single company for brand 
promotion in a single country for more than five years. This five year 
period shall not begin prior to the 1994 program or the participant's 
first activity plan year, whichever is later. In limited circumstances, 
the five year limitation may be waived if the Deputy Administrator 
determines that further assistance is necessary in order to meet the 
objectives of the program.
    (e) Formation of agreements. CCC will notify each applicant in 
writing of the final disposition of its application. CCC will send a 
program agreement, allocation approval letter and a signature card to 
each approved applicant. The allocation approval letter will specify any 
special terms and conditions applicable to a participant's program, 
including the required level of participant contribution. An applicant 
that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the program 
agreement and allocation approval letter should so indicate by having 
its Chief Executive Officer sign the program agreement and by submitting 
the signed agreement to the Director, Marketing Operations Staff, FAS, 
USDA. Final agreement shall occur when the

[[Page 558]]

Administrator signs the agreement on behalf of CCC. The application, the 
program agreement, the allocation approval letter and these regulations 
shall establish the terms and conditions of an MAP or EIP/MAP agreement 
between CCC and the approved applicant.
    (f) Signature cards. The participant shall designate at least two 
individuals in its organization to sign program agreements, 
reimbursement claims and advance requests. The participant shall submit 
the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the 
participant's Chief Executive Officer to the Director, Marketing 
Operations Staff, FAS, USDA, and shall immediately notify the Director 
of any changes in signatories and shall submit a revised signature card 
accordingly.

FR 29940, June 2, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1485.15  Activity plan.

    (a) General. A participant shall develop a specific activity plan(s) 
based on its strategic plan and the allocation approval letter and shall 
submit an activity plan for each year in which it engages in program 
activities. An activity plan handbook, available from the Division 
Director, provides suggested formats and codes for activity plans and 
amendments.
    (b) An activity plan shall contain:
    (1) A written presentation of all proposed activities including:
    (i) A short description of the relevant constraint;
    (ii) A description of any changes in strategy from the strategic 
plan;
    (iii) A budget for each proposed activity, identifying the source of 
funds;
    (iv) Specific goals and benchmarks to be used to measure the 
effectiveness of each activity. This will assist CCC in carrying out its 
responsibilities under the Government Performance and Results Act of 
1993 that requires performance measurement of Federal programs, 
including the MAP. Evaluation of MAP's effectiveness will depend on a 
clear statement by participants of goals, method of achievement, and 
results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of the MAP 
and of individual participants' activities is to achieve additional 
exports of U.S. agricultural products, that is, sales that would not 
have occurred in the absence of MAP funding.
    (2) A staffing plan for any overseas office, including a listing of 
job titles, position descriptions, salary ranges and any request for 
approval of supergrade salaries; and
    (3) An itemized administrative budget for any overseas office.
    (c) Activity plans for small-sized entities operating through an 
SRTG shall contain a certification that it is a small-sized entity 
within the standards established by 13 CFR part 121.
    (d) Requests for approval of ``supergrades''. (1) Ordinarily, CCC 
will not reimburse any portion of a non-U.S. citizen employees 
compensation that exceeds the highest salary level in the Foreign 
Service National (FSN) salary plan applicable to the country in which 
the employee works. However, a participant may seek a higher level of 
reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen who will be employed as a country 
director or regional director by requesting that CCC approve that 
employee as a ``supergrade''.
    (2) To request approval of a ``supergrade'', the participant shall 
include in its activity plan a detailed description of both the duties 
and responsibilities of the position, and of the qualifications and 
background of the employee concerned. The participant shall also justify 
why the highest FSN salary level is insufficient.
    (3) Where a non-U.S. citizen will be employed as a country director, 
the MAP participant may request approval for a ``Supergrade I'' salary 
level, equivalent to a grade increase over the existing top grade of the 
FSN salary plan. The ``supergrade'' and its step increases are 
calculated as the percentage difference between the second highest and 
the highest grade in the FSN salary plan with that percentage applied to 
each of the steps in the top grade. Where the non-U.S. citizen will be 
employed as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/
or offices in more than one country, the MAP participant may request 
approval for a ``Supergrade II'' salary level which is calculated 
relative to a ``Supergrade I'' in the same way the

[[Page 559]]

latter is calculated relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary 
plan.
    (e) Submission of the activity plan. A participant shall submit 
three copies of an activity plan to the Division Director and a copy of 
the relevant country section(s) to the Attache/Counselor(s) concerned.
    (f) Activity plan approval. CCC shall indicate in an activity plan 
approval letter which activities and budgets are approved or 
disapproved, and shall indicate any special terms and conditions that 
apply to the participant including any requirements with respect to 
contributions and program evaluations. A participant may undertake 
promotional activities directly or through a foreign third party; 
however, the participant shall be responsible and accountable to CCC for 
all such promotional activities and related expenditures.
    (g) Activity plan changes. (1) A participant may request changes to 
an activity plan by submitting one copy of an APAR to each of the 
Division Director and the Attache/Counselor(s) concerned.
    (2) An APAR for a new activity shall contain the information 
required in paragraph (b) of this section. All other APAR's shall 
contain the activity description, the proposed budget and a 
justification for transfer of funds, if applicable.


<R05>

and

[[Page 560]]

    (ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy 
personnel;
    (2) Approved ``supergrade'' salaries for non-U.S. citizens and non-

reimbursable basis. CCC will not advance funds to an EIP/MAP participant 
or to an MAP participant for brand promotion activities.
    (b) Exception. Upon request, CCC may advance payments to an MAP

maintain a financial management system that conforms to generally 
accepted accounting principles.
    (2) An MAP participant shall institute internal controls and provide 
written guidance to commercial entities participating in its activities 
to ensure their compliance with these provisions. Each participant shall 
maintain all original records and documents relating to program 
activities for five calendar years following the end of the applicable 
activity plan year and shall make such records and documents available 
upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government. An MAP 
participant shall also maintain all documents related to employment such 
as employment applications, contracts, position descriptions, leave 
records and salary changes, and all records pertaining to contractors.
    (3) A participant shall maintain its records of expenditures and 
contributions in a manner that allows it to provide information by 
activity plan, country, activity number and cost category. Such records 
shall include:
    (i) Receipts for all STRE (actual vendor invoices or restaurant 
checks, rather than credit card receipts);
    (ii) Original receipts for any other program related expenditure in 
excess of $25.00;
    (iii) The exchange rate used to calculate the dollar equivalent of 
expenditures made in a foreign currency and the basis for such 
calculation;
    (iv) Copies of reimbursement claims;
    (v) An itemized list of claims charged to each of the participant's 
CCC resources accounts;
    (vi) Documentation with accompanying English translation supporting 
each reimbursement claim, including original evidence to support the 
financial transactions such as canceled checks, receipted paid bills, 
contracts or purchase orders, per diem calculations, travel vouchers, 
and credit memos; and
    (vii) Documentation supporting contributions must include: the 
dates, purpose and location of the activity for which the cash or in-
kind items were claimed as a contribution; who conducted the activity; 
the participating groups or individuals; and, the method of computing 
the claimed contributions. MAP participants must retain and make 
available for audit documentation related to claimed contributions.
    (4) Upon request, a participant shall provide to CCC originals of 
documents supporting reimbursement claims.
    (b) Reports. (1) End-of-Year Contribution Report. Not later than 6 
months after the end of its activity plan year, a participant shall 
submit two copies of a report which identifies, by activity and cost 
category and in U.S. dollar equivalent, contributions made by the 
participant, the U.S. industry and foreign third parties during that 
activity plan year. A suggested format of a contribution report is 
available from the Division Director.
    (2) Trip reports. Not later than 45 days after completion of travel 
(other than local travel), an MAP participant shall submit a trip

[[Page 564]]

    (5) CCC may require the submission of additional reports.
    (6) A participant shall provide to the FAS Compliance Review Staff 
upon request any audit reports by independent public accountants.
    (c) Evaluation--(1) Policy. (i) The Government Performance and 
Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 
3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, 
including MAP. Evaluation of MAP's effectiveness will depend on a clear 
statement by participants of goals to be met within a specified time, 
schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, plan for 
achievement, and results of activities at regular intervals. The overall 
goal of the MAP and of individual participants' activities is to achieve 
additional exports of U.S. agricultural products, that is, sales that 
would not have occurred in the absence of MAP funding. A participant 
that can demonstrate additional sales compared to a representative base 
period, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the participant's 
control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need 
for evaluation.
    (ii) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and 
implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan and activity 
plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a 
participant's program, contributing to program accountability and 
providing evidence of program effectiveness.
    (iii) An MAP participant shall conduct periodic evaluations of its 
program and activities and may contract with an independent evaluator to 
satisfy this requirement. CCC reserves the right to have direct input 
and control over design, scope and methodology of any such evaluation, 
including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the 
independent evaluator.
    (2) Types of evaluation. (i) An activity evaluation is a review of 
an activity to determine whether such activity achieved the goals 
specified in the activity plan. Unless specifically exempted in the 
activity plan, all activity evaluations shall be completed within 90 
days following the end of the MAP participant's activity plan year.
    (ii) A brand promotion evaluation is a review of the U.S. and 
foreign commercial entities' export sales to determine whether the 
activity achieved the goals specified in the activity plan. These 
evaluations shall be completed within 90 days following the end of the 
participant's activity plan year.
    (iii) A program evaluation is a review of the MAP participant's 
entire program or any appropriate portion of the program to determine 
the effectiveness of the participant's strategy in meeting specified 
goals. An MAP participant shall complete at least one program evaluation 
each year. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be 
determined by the MAP participant and the Division Director and 
specified in the MAP participant's activity plan approval letter.
    (3) Contents of program evaluation. A program evaluation shall 
contain:
    (i) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
    (ii) The activities covered by the evaluation (including the 
activity numbers);
    (iii) A concise statement of the constraint(s) and the goals 
specified in the activity plan;
    (iv) A description of the evaluation methodology;
    (v) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the 
ratio of additional export sales in relation to MAP funding received;
    (vi) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
    (vii) Recommendations for future programs.
    (4) An MAP participant shall submit via a cover letter to the 
Division Director, an executive summary which provides assessment of the 
program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposed changes 
in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation.
    (5) If as a result of an evaluation or audit of activities of a 
participant under the program, CCC determines that further review is 
needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 
program, CCC may require the participant to contract for an independent 
audit of the program activities,

[[Page 565]]

    (d) Appeals. (1) The Director, Compliance Review Staff (Director, 
CRS) will notify a participant through a compliance report when it 
appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from that participant. 
The compliance report will state the basis for this action.
    (2) A participant may, within 60 days of the date of the compliance 
report, submit a response to the Director, CRS. The Director, CRS, at 
the Director's discretion, may extend the period for response up to an 
additional 30 days. If the participant does not respond to the 
compliance report within the required time period or, if after review of 
the participant's response, the Director, CRS, determines that CCC may 
be entitled to recover funds from the participant, the Director, CRS, 
will refer the compliance report to the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) If after review of the compliance report and response, the 
Deputy Administrator determines that the participant owes any money to 
CCC he will so inform the participant and provide the basis for the 
decision. The Deputy Administrator may initiate action to collect such 
amount pursuant to 7 C.F.R. Part 1403, Debt Settlement Policies and 
Procedures. Determinations of the Deputy Administrator will be in 
writing and in sufficient detail to inform the participant of the basis 
for the determination. The participant may request reconsideration 
within 30 days of the date of the Deputy Administrator's initial 
determination.
    (4) The Participant may appeal determinations of the Deputy 
Administrator to the Administrator. An appeal must be in writing and be 
submitted to the office of the Deputy Administrator within 30 days 
following the date of the initial determination by the Deputy 
Administrator or the determination on reconsideration. The participant 
may request a hearing.
    (5) If the participant submits its appeal and requests a hearing, 
the Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, will set a date and 
time, generally within 60 days. The hearing will be an informal 
proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the 
participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, the Administrator 
may have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.
    (6) The Administrator will base the determination on appeal upon 
information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to 
make a determination within 60 days after submission of the appeal, 
hearing or receipt of any transcript, whichever is later. The 
determination of the Administrator will be the final determination of 
CCC. The participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained 
in this subsection before pursuing judicial review of a determination by 
the Administrator.

height based on the lower case letter ``o''. A participant may request 
an exemption from this requirement. All such requests shall be in 
writing and include justification satisfactory to the Deputy 
Administrator that this labelling requirement would hinder a 
participant's promotional efforts. The Deputy Administrator will 
determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification 
exists to grant an exemption from the labelling requirement;
    (7) Specify documentation requirements for a U.S. brand applicant 
seeking priority consideration for assistance based on eligibility as a 
small-sized entity;
    (8) Require that the U.S. brand participant submit to the MAP 
participant a statement certifying that any Federal funds received will 
supplement, but not supplant, any private or third party funds or other 
contributions to program activities; and
    (9) The participant shall require the brand participant to maintain 
all original records and documents relating to program activities for 
five calendar years following the end of the applicable activity plan 
year and shall make such records and documents available upon request to 
authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
    (f) EIP/MAP participants shall ensure that all product labels, 
promotional material and advertising will identify the origin of the 
agricultural commodity as ``Product of the U.S.'', ``Product of the 
U.S.A.'', ``Grown in the U.S.'',

[[Page 568]]

``Grown in the U.S.A.'', ``Made in America'' or other U.S. regional 
designation if approved in advance by CCC; such origin identification is 
conspicuously displayed in a manner that is easily observed, and that, 
to the fullest extent possible, the origin identification conforms to 
the U.S. standard of 1/6" (.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower 
case letter ``o''. An EIP/ MAP participant may request an exemption from 
this requirement. All such requests shall be in writing and include 
justification satisfactory to the Deputy Administrator that this 
labelling requirement would hinder a participant's promotional efforts. 
The Deputy Administrator will determine, on a case by case basis, 
whether sufficient justification exists to grant an exemption from the 
labelling requirement;
    (g) Travel shall conform to U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR 
parts 301 through 304) and air travel shall conform to the requirements 
of the ``Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 1517).'' The MAP participant shall 
notify the Attache/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in 
advance of any proposed travel.
    (h) Proceeds. Any income or refunds generated from an activity, 
i.e., participation fees, proceeds of sales, refunds of value added 
taxes (VAT), the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially 
reimbursed, shall be repaid by submitting a check payable to CCC or 
offsetting the participant's next reimbursement claim. However, where 
CCC reimburses a participant with CCC commodity certificates, such 
participant may retain any income generated by the sale of such 
certificates.

[[Page 573]]

change in the interest rate. After the commodity has been delivered, CCC

    (a) Unless delivery by the exporter to the importer is made within 
such period as may be provided in the financing agreement or any 
amendment thereof, or under paragraph (b) of this section, the financing 
agreement will no longer be valid.

was due solely to causes without the fault or negligence of the 
exporter, the period for delivery may be extended by CCC by the period 
of such delay.
    (c) If delivery is made before export under the terms of the 
financing agreement, failure to export within the period specified 
therefor in the financing agreement shall constitute a breach of the 
financing agreement. In such case, if full payment under the bank

receivable and the bank obligation shall, at the option of the Assistant 
Sales Manager, become immediately due and payable, and liquidated 
damages shall be payable in accordance with Sec. 1488.11.

Sec. 1488.9 and, if the consignee is other than the foreign importer 
named in the financing agreement, such additional information as CCC may 
request to show that export was made in accordance with the instructions

    (g) If an acceptable application for disbursement and the supporting 
documents described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section have 
not been received by CCC within 45 days from the date of the delivery, 
or any extension thereof by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer, CCC, 
the financing agreement shall be void.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) If for any reason a draft drawn under a foreign bank obligation 
is dishonored or if the issuing bank is insolvent, in bankruptcy, in 
receivership, or in liquidation, or has made an assignment for the

another acceptable foreign bank obligation covering such balance due if 
confirmed in accordance with Sec. 1488.12.

                   Documents Required After Financing


<R05>
Sec. 1488.10  Evidence of entry into country of destination.

    (a) Commodities exported under a financing agreement must enter the 
destination country specified in the financing agreement.
    (b) For a financing agreement under which the financing period is in 
excess of 12 months, within 90 days, or such extension of time as may be 
granted in writing by the Assistant Sales Manager, following shipment 
from the United States of any agricultural commodity exported under the 
financing agreement, the exporter shall furnish to the office specified 
in Sec. 1488.22, documentary evidence verifying entry of the commodity 
into the country of destination specified in the financing agreement. 
The documentary evidence must:
    (1) Identify the agricultural commodity (or permit identification 
through supplementary documents also furnished) as that exported under 
the financing agreement,
    (2) State the quantity and date of entry of the commodity into the 
destination country, and
    (3) Be signed by (i) a customs official of the destination country, 
or (ii) the importer, or (iii) a representative of an independent 
superintending or controlling firm.
    (c) When the commodity enters the country of destination in bond, a 
statement by the importer will be acceptable which:
    (1) Identifies the commodity as that exported under the financing 
agreement,
    (2) States the quantity of the commodity entered under bond and date 
of entry into the destination country, and
    (3) Certifies that the commodity will be withdrawn from bonded 
storage at a later date for consumption in the destination country.
    (d) If the evidence of entry is in other than the English language, 
the exporter shall also provide an English translation thereof.
    (e) Failure to furnish, within the time specified, evidence of entry 
of the commodity into the country of destination shall constitute prima 
facie evidence of failure to enter or to cause the entry of the 
commodity into such country as required. In such case, the financing 
agreement may be terminated by the Assistant Sales Manager, and if full 
payment under the bank obligation or account receivable has not yet been 
received, the bank obligation and the account receivable shall at the 
option of CCC, become due and payable and liquidated damages shall be 
payable in accordance with Sec. 1488.11. The remedy herein provided 
shall not be exclusive of other rights available to the Federal 
government if the commodity enters a country other than that specified 
in the financing agreement.

                          Delivery Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1488.11  Liquidated damages.

    Failure of the exporter to export or cause to be exported, within 
the period provided therefor, any agricultural commodity financed, when 
delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing 
agreement, or failure of the exporter to enter or cause the entry of, 
such commodity into the country of destination, shall constitute a 
breach of the financing agreement which will result in serious and 
substantial damage to CCC and to its program. Since it will be 
difficult, if not

[[Page 576]]

impossible, to prove the exact amount of such damage, the exporter shall 
pay to CCC promptly on demand, as reasonable compensation and not as a 
penalty, liquidated damages in lieu of probable actual damages, as 
follows:
    (a) For each day of delay in exportation after the final date for 
exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the 
financing agreement, .15 percent of the amount financed under the 
financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (b) for failure to 
export or cause exportation, when delivery is made before export under 
the terms of the financing agreement, 5 percent of the amount financed 
under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (c) for 
failure, after exportation, to enter or cause the entry of the commodity 
into the country of destination, at the rate of 5 percent a year of the 
amount financed under the financing agreement for such commodity from 
the start of the financing period until payment to CCC of the amount 
financed; Provided however, That the aggregate of all amounts assessed 
under this Sec. 1488.11 with respect to the same commodity shall not 
exceed 5 percent of the amount financed for such commodity. Liquidated 
damages shall not be assessed: Under paragraph (a) of this section if 
the Assistant Sales manager determines that the delay was due to such 
causes as acts of God or government or public enemy, fires, floods, 
epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, or 
unusually severe weather; under paragraph (b) of this section if the 
Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to export was due to 
loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of 
God or government or public enemy; and under paragraph (c) of this 
section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to enter 
or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination was 
due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or 
act of God or government or public enemy.

                     Bank Obligations and Repayment


<R05>
Sec. 1488.12  Coverage of bank obligations.

    (a) U.S. banks and branch banks shall be liable without regard to 
risk (1) for payment of bank obligations issued by them or (2) for 
payment of bank obligations confirmed by them without regard to risk if 
a requirement for such confirmation is included in the financing 
agreement or (3) as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (b) An obligation issued by a foreign bank must be confirmed and 
advised, as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this 
section, by a U.S. bank or a branch bank, or may be confirmed by an 
agency bank when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC 
after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of 
CCC.
    (c) A U.S. bank must confirm the full amount of an obligation issued 
by its foreign branch. CCC will hold the U.S. bank liable for payment 
without regard to risks.
    (d) If a branch bank confirms an obligation issued by its home 
office, or by another branch of its home office, it must confirm the 
full amount thereof. CCC will hold the branch bank liable for payment 
without regard to risks.
    (e) If CCC accepts an agency bank confirmation of a foreign bank 
obligation, it must be for the full amount thereof without regard to 
risks and will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be 
contained in the financing agreement. CCC will not accept an agency bank 
confirmation of an obligation issued by its home office, or by a branch 
of its home office.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this 
section, if a U.S. bank or a branch bank confirms an obligation issued 
by a foreign bank, it must confirm at least 10 percent pro rata and must 
advise the remainder of the foreign bank obligation. The percentage of 
confirmation shall be the same for both the account receivable and the 
interest portions of the obligation. For the confirmed amount, except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, CCC will hold the U.S. 
bank or

[[Page 577]]

branch bank liable for commercial risks but not for non-commercial 
risks. For the advised amount, CCC will not hold the U.S. bank or branch 
bank liable for commercial or non-commercial risks. CCC will hold the 
foreign bank liable without regard to risks for all amounts not 
recovered from the U.S. or branch bank.
    (g) Under special circumstances, on application in writing, the Vice 
President, CCC, may reduce or waive requirements for 10 percent 
confirmation by a U.S. or branch bank, but a bank will not be relieved 
of any obligation it undertakes.
    (h) Any bank obligation which provides for a bank acceptance of a 
time draft by CCC (banker's acceptance) shall not be acceptable to CCC.
    (i) CCC will consent to cancellation or reduction of a bank 
obligation to the extent of any payment it receives from other sources 
or amounts otherwise payable under such bank obligation.
    (j) Collection of accounts receivable purchased under GSM-5 will be 
effected through the issuance by CCC of sight drafts against the bank 
obligations, but this method of collection shall not be exclusive of any 
other collection procedures or rights available to CCC.

<R05>
Sec. 1488.13  CCC drafts.

    CCC will draw one draft for each payment due under bank obligations. 
If any portion of a CCC draft is dishonored, the U.S. bank or branch 
bank shall return the dishonored draft together with its statement of 
the reason for nonpayment. If a draft which is drawn under a partially 
confirmed bank obligation is dishonored, CCC will replace the draft with 
separate drafts for the confirmed and unconfirmed portions at the 
request of the confirming bank. Such replacement shall not alter the 
confirming bank's obligation for timely payment to CCC of the confirmed 
portion of the credit. For confirmed amounts, except as provided in 
Sec. 1488.12(a), (c) and (d), a U.S. or branch bank may request refund 
from CCC of the amount paid if it certifies to CCC that it is unable to 
recover funds from the foreign bank due to a stipulated non-commercial 
risk which existed on the date payment was made to CCC under the draft. 
If CCC finds that inability to recover funds was due to such a non-
commercial risk, the refund shall be promptly made together with 
interest at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discount rate from and 
including the date payment was originally made to CCC but not include 
the date of refund by CCC. For unconfirmed amounts, remittance to CCC 
shall be considered final, and the U.S. bank or branch bank shall not 
thereafter have recourse to CCC.

FR 30833, June 17, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.14  Interest charges.

    The account receivable assigned to CCC and the related bank 
obligation(s) shall bear interest as specified in this section. Rates of 
interest applicable to financing agreements shall be published in USDA 
announcement. The interest rate applicable to that portion of an account 
receivable for which payment is assured by a bank obligation issued or 
confirmed for all risks according to Sec. 1488.12(a)(ii) or pro rata 
confirmed by a U.S. bank shall be lower than the interest rate 
applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest 
rate applicable to that portion of an account receivable the payment of 
which is assured by a bank obligation issued or pro rata confirmed by a 
branch bank shall, when determined by the President or Vice President, 
CCC after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest 
of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of 
the account receivable. The interest rates applicable to accounts 
receivable the payment of which is assured by an agency bank 
confirmation may, when determined by the President or Vice President, 
CCC, after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest 
of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of 
the account receivable. The interest rate applicable will be the rate in 
effect on the date CCC receives the sale registration request under 
Sec. 1488.4.

[[Page 578]]

Interest shall accrue on the account receivable from the date of 
delivery or the weighted average delivery date of the agricultural 
commodities delivered under the financing agreement to the date of 
payment, or to the date of expiration of the financing period, or to the 
date of expiration of the bank obligation, whichever occurs first, and 
shall be payable as specified in the financing agreement. Thereafter, 
interest shall accrue on any unpaid part of both the principal and 
interest due as of such expiration date.

[42 FR 10999, Feb. 25, 1977, as amended at 42 FR 27569, May 31, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.15  Advance payment.

    If, before expiration of the financing period, the exporter or the 
U.S. bank or the agency or branch bank accepts payment from or on behalf 
of the foreign importer of any part of the account receivable, it shall 
be remitted promptly to CCC. Such prepayment shall be applied first to 
interest on the unpaid balance of the account receivable to the date CCC 
receives such prepayment and then to the principal.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.16  Liability for payment.

    If delivery is made within the coverage of the bank obligation(s) 
submitted in accordance with Sec. 1488.8, CCC will look to the 
obligating bank or banks and the foreign importer, rather than to the 
exporter or intervening purchaser, for payment of all amounts due at 
maturity of the account receivable and of the bank obligation(s), but 
the exporter and the intervening purchaser shall remain liable for any 
loss arising from breach of any contractual obligation, certification or 
warranty made by them pursuant to the financing agreement, and the 
exporter shall remain liable for any amounts not covered by the bank 
obligation which are owing to CCC, and any remittance or refund required 
by Sec. 1488.15 and Sec. 1488.18, together with interest thereon at the 
rate specified in the documents evidencing the account receivable, as 
well as for any liquidated damages provided for in Sec. 1488.11. The 
liability of the bank and the importer under their respective 
obligations shall be several.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1488.17  Assignment.

    The exporter shall not assign any claim or rights or any amounts 
payable under the financing agreement, in whole or in part, without 
written approval of the Vice President, CCC, or the Controller, CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.18  Covenant against contingent fees.

    The exporter warrants that no person or selling agency has been 
employed or retained to solicit or secure the financing agreement on an 
agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or 
contingent fee, except bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty, 
CCC shall have the right, without limitation on any other rights it may 
have, to annul the financing agreement without liability to CCC. Should 
the financing agreement be annulled, CCC will promptly consent to the 
reduction or cancellation or related bank obligations except for amounts 
outstanding under a financing agreement. Such amounts shall, on demand, 
be refunded to CCC by the exporter.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.19  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1488.20  Officials not to benefit.

    No member of or delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, 
shall be admitted to any share or part of the financing agreement or to 
any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this provision shall not be 
construed to extend to the financing agreement if made with a 
corporation for its general benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 1488.21  Exporter's records and accounts.

    CCC shall have access to and the right to examine any directly 
pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the exporter involving 
transactions related to the financed export credit sale until the 
expiration of three years after the end of the financing period.

    (a) Unless otherwise provided, written requests, notifications, or 
communications by the applicant pertaining to the financing agreement

Programs, Office of the General Sales Manager, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

    Subpart A--Restrictions and Criteria for Export Credit Guarantee 
                                Programs


<R05>
Sec. 1493.1  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the restrictions which apply to the use of 
credit

[[Page 580]]

guarantees under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit 
Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate Credit Guarantee 
Program (GSM-103) and the criteria considered by CCC in determining the 
annual allocations of credit guarantees to be made available with 
respect to each participating country. This subpart also sets forth the 
criteria considered by CCC in the review and approval of proposed 
allocation levels for GSM-102 and/or GSM-103 credit guarantees which may 
be made available in connection with export sales of specific U.S. 
agricultural commodities to these countries. These restrictions and 
criteria are interrelated and will be applied and considered together in 
the process of determining which sales opportunities under GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 will best meet the purposes of the programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.2  Purposes of programs.

    CCC may use export credit guarantees:
    (a) To increase exports of U.S. agricultural commodities;
    (b) To compete against foreign agricultural exports;
    (c) To assist countries, particularly developing countries, in 
meeting their food and fiber needs; and
    (d) For such other purposes as the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines appropriate, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 1493.6.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.3  Restrictions on programs and cargo preference statement.

    (a) Restrictions on use of credit guarantees. (1) Export credit 
guarantees authorized under these regulations shall not be used for 
foreign aid, foreign policy, or debt rescheduling purposes.
    (2) CCC shall not make credit guarantees available in connection 
with sales of agricultural commodities to any country that the Secretary 
determines cannot adequately service the debt associated with such 
sales.
    (b) Cargo preference laws. The provisions of the cargo preference 
laws shall not apply to export sales with respect to which credit is 
guaranteed under these programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.4  Criteria for country allocations.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for country 
allocations under the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programs, will include, but not 
be limited to, the following:
    (a) Potential benefits that the extension of export credit 
guarantees would provide for the development, expansion or maintenance 
of the market for particular U.S. agricultural commodities in the 
importing country;
    (b) Financial and economic ability of the importing country to 
adequately service CCC guaranteed debt;
    (c) Financial status of participating banks in the importing country 
as it would affect their ability to adequately service CCC guaranteed 
debt;
    (d) Political stability of the importing country as it would affect 
its ability to adequately service CCC guaranteed debt; and
    (e) Current status of debt either owed by the importing country to 
CCC or to lenders protected by CCC's guarantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.5  Criteria for agricultural commodity allocations.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for specific 
U.S. commodity allocations within a specific country allocation will 
include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) Potential benefits that the extension of export credit 
guarantees would provide for the development, expansion or maintenance 
of the market in the importing country for the particular U.S. 
agricultural commodity under consideration;
    (b) The best use to be made of the export credit guarantees in 
assisting the importing country in meeting its particular needs for food 
and fiber, as may be determined through consultations with private 
buyers and/or representatives of the government of the importing 
country;
    (c) Evaluation, in terms of program purposes, of the relative 
benefits of providing payment guarantee coverage for sales of the U.S. 
agricultural commodity under consideration compared to providing 
coverage for sales of other U.S. agricultural commodities; and
    (d) Evaluation of the near and long term potential for sales on a 
cash basis

[[Page 581]]

of the U.S. commodity under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.6  Additional required determinations for GSM-103.

    Notwithstanding any other provision under this part, CCC shall not 
guarantee under the GSM-103 program the repayment of credit made 
available to finance an export sale unless the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines that such sale will:
    (a) Develop, expand or maintain the importing country as a foreign 
market, on a long-term basis, for the commercial sale and export of U.S. 
agricultural commodities, without displacing normal commercial sales;
    (b) Improve the capability of the importing country to purchase or 
use, on a long-term basis, U.S. agricultural commodities; or
    (c) Otherwise promote the export of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R04>
    Subpart B--CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and CCC 
    Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) Operations


<R05>
Sec. 1493.10  General statement.

    (a) Overview. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing 
the operations of the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the 
Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103). The GSM-102 and GSM-103 
programs of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were developed to 
expand U.S. agricultural exports by making available export credit 
guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing of foreign 
purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities on credit terms. Under GSM-
102, credit guarantees are issued for terms of up to three years. Under 
GSM-103, credit guarantees are issued for terms of from three to ten 
years.
    (2) The programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to 
increase or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private 
U.S. financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing 
without CCC's guarantee. The programs are operated in a manner intended 
not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs are targeted 
toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure 
financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial strength so 
that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In 
providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market 
opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term 
market development for U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (3) The credit facility created by these programs is the CCC payment 
guarantee. The payment guarantee is an agreement by CCC to pay the 
exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of 
the exporter's right to proceeds, specified amounts of principal and 
interest due from, but not paid by, the foreign bank issuing an 
irrevocable letter of credit in connection with the export sale to which 
CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, 
rather than governmental, financing and incurs a substantial portion of 
the risk of default by the foreign bank. CCC assumes this risk, in order 
to be able to operate the programs for the purposes specified in 
Sec. 1493.2.
    (b) Credit facility mechanism. Typically, in export sales of U.S. 
agricultural commodities, payment by the importer is made under an 
irrevocable letter of credit. For the purpose of the GSM-102 and GSM-103 
programs, CCC will consider applications for payment guarantees only in 
connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the 
payment for the agricultural commodities will be made in one of the two 
following ways:
    (1) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of 
the exporter, specifically stating the deferred payment terms under 
which the foreign bank is obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as 
such payments become due; or
    (2) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of 
the exporter, that is supported by a related obligation specifically 
stating the deferred payment terms under which the

[[Page 582]]

foreign bank is obligated to make payment to the exporter, or the 
exporter's assignee, in U.S. dollars as such payments become due. The 
exporter may assign the right to proceeds under the letter of credit or 
related obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that 
the exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred 
payment date(s) as set forth in the irrevocable foreign bank letter of 
credit or its related obligation. The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs are 
designed to protect the exporter or the exporter's assignee against 
those losses specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults, 
whether for commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the foreign bank 
obligated under the letter of credit or related obligation.
    (c) Program administration. The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs will be 
administered pursuant to this part and any Program Announcements and 
Notices to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent 
with, this part. These programs are under the general administrative 
responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS/USDA). The review and payment of claims for loss will be 
administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding 
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, 
and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular USDA or CCC offices, 
will be announced by a public press release (see Sec. 1493.20(c), 
``Contacts P/R'').
    (d) Country allocations and program announcements. From time to 
time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a GSM-102 and/or 
GSM-103 program allocation for a specific country. The Program 
Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific 
allocations for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof. 
Exporters may negotiate export sales to buyers in that country for one 
of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement and seek 
payment guarantee coverage within the dollar amounts of specified 
coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a 
requirement that the exporter's sales contract contain a shipping 
deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for a 
contractual shipping deadline will be stated in the Program 
Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified 
``undesignated'' or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that 
if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country 
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or 
``undesignated'' portion of the total country allocation may then be 
designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include 
an ``allocated'' or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain further 
information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion of the 
country allocation.

a subsidiary division, or business segment, and similar positions).] I 
further agree that, should any such debarment, suspension, or notice of 
proposed debarment occur in the future, [name of applicant] will 
immediately notify CCC.''
    (b) Previous qualification. Any exporter that has previously 
qualified under this section may submit applications for GSM-102 or GSM-
103 payment guarantees. Each application must include the statement 
required by Sec. 1493.40(a)(18) incorporating the certifications of 
Sec. 1493.50, including the certification in Sec. 1493.50(e) that the

Sec. 1493.40  Application for payment guarantee.

    (a) A firm export sale must exist before an exporter may submit an 
application for a payment guarantee. An application for a payment 
guarantee may be submitted in writing or may be made by telephone, but, 
if made by telephone, it must be confirmed in writing to the office 
specified in the Contacts P/R. An application must identify the name and 
address of the exporter and include the following information:
    (1) Name of the destination country.
    (2) Name and address of the importer.
    (3) Name and address of the intervening purchaser, if any, and a 
statement that the commodity will be shipped directly to the importer in 
the destination country.
    (4) Date of sale.
    (5) Exporter's sale number.
    (6) Delivery period as agreed between the exporter and the importer.
    (7) A full description of the commodity (including packaging, if 
any).
    (8) Mean quantity, contract loading tolerance and, if necessary, a 
request for CCC to reserve coverage up to the maximum quantity permitted 
by the contract loading tolerance.
    (9) Unit sales price of the commodity, or a mechanism to establish 
the price, as agreed between the exporter and the importer. If the 
commodity was sold on the basis of CFR or CIF, the actual (if known at 
the time of application) or estimated value of freight and, in the case 
of sales made on a CIF basis, the actual (if known at the time of 
application) or estimated value of marine and war risk insurance, must 
be specified.
    (10) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any.
    (11) Port value (includes upward loading tolerance, if any).
    (12) Guaranteed value.
    (13) Guarantee fee.
    (14) Name and location of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.

[[Page 587]]

    (15) The term length for the credit being extended and the intervals 
between principal payments for each shipment to be made under the export 
sale.
    (16) A statement indicating whether any portion of the export sale 
for which the exporter is applying for a payment guarantee is also being 
used as the basis for an application for participation in any of the 
following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, Dairy 
Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or 
Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program. The number of the Agreement assigned 
by USDA under one of these programs should be included, as applicable.
    (17) Other information as specified in Notices to Participants, as 
applicable.
    (18) The exporter's statement, ``All Section 1493.50 Certifications 
Are Being Made In This Application'' which, when included in the 
application by the exporter, will constitute a certification that it is 
in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 1493.50.
    (b) An application for a payment guarantee may be approved as 
submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the exporter, or 
rejected by the GSM. In the event that the application is approved, the 
GSM will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time 
specified in Sec. 1493.60(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit 
sales price of the commodity does not fall within the prevailing 
commercial market level ranges, as determined by CCC, the application 
will not be approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.50  Certification requirements for obtaining payment guarantee.

    By providing the statement in Sec. 1493.40(a)(18), the exporter is 
certifying that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section 
have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide 
further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do 
not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application 
for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in 
Sec. 1493.40(a)(18), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the 
payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.20(z).
    (b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law;
    (c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable 
oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been 
or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, 
pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of 
any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity 
or product;
    (d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to 
solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement 
or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent 
fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established 
commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the 
purpose of securing business; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.30 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.30, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications 
with respect to a GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, CCC will have 
the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, 
to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or 
to proceed against the exporter.

[59 FR 52876, Oct. 19, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 24561, May 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.60  Payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's obligation. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC 
agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to 
exceed the

[[Page 588]]

guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that the foreign 
bank fails to pay under the foreign bank letter of credit or the related 
obligation. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.
    (b) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to the period beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or on the 
date when interest begins to accrue, whichever is earlier, and will 
continue during the credit term specified in the payment guarantee or 
amendments thereto. However, the payment guarantee becomes effective on 
the date(s) of export(s) of the agricultural commodities or products 
thereof specified in the exporter's application for a payment guarantee.
    (c) Terms of the CCC payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's coverage 
will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the 
time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (d) Final date to export. The final date to export shown on the 
payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the 
contractual deadline for shipping.
    (e) Reserve coverage for loading tolerances. The exporter may apply 
for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee 
fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the 
export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC 
reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of 
the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If 
such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of 
application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so 
indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a 
quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid 
(i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage 
from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing 
for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional 
amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is 
not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the 
last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve 
the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.
    (f) Ineligible exports. Commodities with a date of export prior to 
the date of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written 
application for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after 
the final date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any 
amendments thereof, are ineligible for GSM-102 or GSM-103 guarantee 
coverage, except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best 
interests of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.
    (g) Foreign agricultural component. CCC may approve payment 
guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United 
States agricultural commodities as defined in Sec. 1493.20(z). CCC may 
not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for 
the value of any foreign agricultural component.
    (h) Additional requirements. The payment guarantee may contain such 
additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or 
desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (i) Amendments. A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee 
may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the 
assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the 
amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable 
Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may 
include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and 
an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, 
particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under 
the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. 
(Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be 
submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as 
amendments.)

<R05>
Sec. 1493.70  Guarantee rates and fees.

    (a) Guarantee fee rates. The payment guarantee fee rates will be 
based upon the length of the payment terms provided for in the export 
sale contract, the degree of risk that CCC assumes, as determined by 
CCC, and any other factors which CCC determines appropriate for 
consideration. A current schedule of the guarantee fee rates charged by 
CCC under GSM-102 and GSM-103 will be available upon request from the 
FAS/USDA office specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (b) Calculation of fee. The guarantee fee will be computed by 
multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.
    (c) Payment of fee. The exporter shall remit, with his written 
application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not 
be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The 
exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and 
mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts 
P/R.
    (d) Refunds of fee. Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved 
applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the 
application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be 
made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be 
in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee 
is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage 
requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.80  Evidence of export.

    (a) Report of export. The exporter is required to provide CCC an 
evidence of export report for each shipment made under the payment 
guarantee. This report must include the following:
    (1) Payment guarantee number
    (2) Date of export
    (3) Exporter's sale number
    (4) Exported value
    (5) Quantity
    (6) A full description of the commodity exported
    (7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the 
basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price at export 
differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, the exporter is also required to 
submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference.
    (8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any.
    (9) Number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under another program 
if any portion of the export sale was also approved for participation in 
the following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, 
Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or 
Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program.
    (10) The exporter's statement, ``All Sec. 1493.90 Certifications Are 
Being Made In This Evidence Of Export'' which, when included in the 
evidence of export by the exporter, will constitute a certification that 
it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in Sec. 1493.90.
    (b) Time limit for submission of evidence of export. The exporter 
must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/
R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 
calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period 
for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of 
the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of 
export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, 
the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the 
extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely 
to result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the 
program;
    (3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or
    (4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for 
submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such 
extension is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.
    (c) Export sales reporting. Exporters may have a mandatory reporting 
responsibility under Section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 
(7 U.S.C. 5712), as amended by Section 1531 of the Food, Agriculture, 
Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 for exports of wheat

[[Page 590]]

and wheat flour, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, and other agricultural 
commodities and products thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.90  Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

    By providing the statement contained in Sec. 1493.80(a)(10), the 
exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of 
export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements 
set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be 
required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to 
reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or 
violates these certifications with respect to a GSM-102 or GSM-103 
payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other 
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any 
commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The 
exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the 
statement set forth in Sec. 1493.80(a)(10), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment 
guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.20(z).
    (b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity 
called for in the exporter's sales contract with the importer have been 
exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee;
    (c) A letter of credit has been opened in favor of the exporter by 
the foreign bank shown in the payment guarantee to cover the port value 
of the commodity exported;
    (d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.30 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.30 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is 
a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements.

Sec. 1493.100  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of commodities covered by a GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 payment guarantee to a country other than that shown on the 
payment guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.
    (b) Records of proof of entry. Exporters must obtain and maintain 
records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant 
authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be 
necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programs in the 
country that was the intended country of destination of such 
commodities. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be in English or 
be accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable to CCC. 
Records acceptable to meet this requirement include an original 
certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs or port 
official of the importing country, by the importer, by an agent or 
representative of the vessel or shipline which delivered the 
agricultural commodity to the importing country, or by a private 
surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation deemed 
acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (1) That the agricultural commodity entered the importing country;
    (2) The identification of the export carrier;
    (3) The quantity of the agricultural commodity;
    (4) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the agricultural 
commodity; and
    (5) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the agricultural 
commodity in the importing country. [Records of proof of entry need not 
be submitted with a claim for loss, except as may be provided in 
Sec. 1493.110(b)(4)(ii).]


<R05>
Sec. 1493.110  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms

[[Page 591]]

of the foreign bank letter of credit or related obligation, the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as 
soon as possible, but not later than 10 calendar days after the date 
that payment was due from the foreign bank (the due date). A notice of 
default must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the 
address specified in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with 
this paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with 
respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit 
may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if such 
extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best 
interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the country;
    (3) Name of the defaulting bank;
    (4) Due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately 
the amounts for principal and interest;
    (6) Date of foreign bank's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for foreign bank's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must 
be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified 
in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following 
information and documents:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the foreign 
bank obligation applicable to the claim;
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i)(A) The foreign bank letter of credit securing the export sale; 
and
    (B) If applicable, the document(s) evidencing the related obligation 
owed by the foreign bank to the assignee financial institution which is 
related to the foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such related obligation must be demonstrated in one of the 
following ways:
    (1) The related obligation, including a specific promise to pay on 
deferred payment terms, may be contained in the letter of credit as a 
special instruction from the issuing bank directly to the U.S. financial 
institution to refinance the amounts paid by the U.S. financial 
institution for obligations financed according to the tenor of the 
letter of credit; or
    (2) The related obligation may be memorialized in a separate 
document(s) specifically identified and referred to in the letter of 
credit as the agreement under which the foreign bank is obliged to repay 
the U.S. financial institution on deferred payment terms; or
    (3) The letter of credit payment obligations may be specifically 
identified in a separate document(s) setting forth the related 
obligation, or in a duly executed amendment thereto, as having been 
financed by the U.S. financial institution pursuant to, and subject to 
repayment in accordance with the terms of, such related obligation; or
    (4) The related obligation may be memorialized in the form of a 
promissory note executed by the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit in favor of the U.S. financial institution submitting the claim;
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the importing country;
    (iii)(A) The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, 
FOB, CFR or CIF values; or
    (B) If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's 
invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's 
invoice to the importer;

[[Page 592]]

    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default 
under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the 
applicable foreign bank letter of credit and the related obligation, if 
applicable; and
    (v) A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the 
exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.80(a).
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. If the initial 
claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee 
need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial 
claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating 
to failure of the foreign bank to make scheduled installments on the 
same export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only 
submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated 
in paragraph (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of 
subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including 
the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.120  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.110, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable 
supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC 
determines that it is liable to the exporter and/or the exporter's 
assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. CCC's maximum liability for any 
claims for loss submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not 
including any late interest payments due in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus 
eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export, 
plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the day of reciept of a claim found 
by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date 
that payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the 
guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section, and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the 
Department of Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the 
foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed by the foreign 
bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the 
foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the exporter, unless 
it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC by the Controller, 
CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the 
entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default 
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition 
to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a 
payment guarantee, CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take 
any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, 
omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has no 
knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Sec. 1493.80 and Sec. 1493.90, excluding post-export adjustments (i.e., 
corrections to evidence of export reports); and

[[Page 593]]

    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.110.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.130  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights 
under the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer, the foreign bank, or any other source whatsoever, such 
monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies 
are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of 
recovery by the exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery 
to the date of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of 
payment by the exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest 
will be charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment 
guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the 
holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided 
that the required information necessary for determining pro rata 
distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 
business days from the date of recovery or 15 business days from 
receiving the required information for determining pro rata 
distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and such interest will accrue from such date to the 
date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of 
the recovery payable to the holder of the payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the 
exporter, the exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will 
be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to 
CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such 
recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on 
a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest 
in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a GSM-102 or 
GSM-103 payment guarantee, CCC prorates any collections it receives and 
shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the 
guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been 
reimbursed in full. Appendix A to Sec. 1493.130--Illustration of Pro 
Rata Allocation of Recoveries--provides an example of the methodology 
used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts 
paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by 
CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in 
material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee 
or for fulfilling obligations under GSM-102 or GSM-103. Further, the 
exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC 
under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the 
exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program 
requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Sec. 1493.50(b) and Sec. 1493.90(d) or the failure of an exporter to 
comply with the provisions of Sec. 1493.100 or Sec. 1493.140(e) will not 
affect the validity of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee 
which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the 
time such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of 
assignment of the payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter

[[Page 594]]

or the exporter's assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries 
from the foreign bank and/or the importer.

  Appendix A to Sec. 1493.130--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.130(c), regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for 
claims filed under the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs. A typical case 
might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit 
arrangement with the foreign bank calling for equal annual payments of 
principal and annual payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per 
annum and a penalty interest rate of 12 percent per annum on overdue 
amounts until the overdue amount is paid.
    2. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of 
$100,000 and an interest payment of $10,000, both due on January 31.
    3. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a claim in good order with 
CCC.
    4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
98 percent of the principal amount due ($98,000) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 98 percent of the principal 
($7,840).
    5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    6. The latest bond equivalent rate of the 52-week Treasury bill 
auction average which has been published by the Department of Treasury 
in effect on the date of nonpayment (January 31) is 9 percent. The 
latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury Bill auction average which 
has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect on the date 
of nonpayment by CCC (February 11) is 7 percent.

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the payment 
guarantee would be computed as follows:
    1. CCC's Obligation under the Payment Guarantee:

 
 
 
(a).............................  Principal coverage-- $98,000.00
                                   (98%  x  $100,000).
(b).............................  Interest coverage--  $7,840.00
                                   (8%  x  $98,000).
                                                      ------------------
                                                       $105,840.00
(c).............................  Late interest due    $223.28
                                   from CCC (7% per
                                   annum for 11 days
                                   x  $105,840).
                                                      ------------------
(d).............................  Amount paid by CCC   $106,063.28
                                   on February 22.
 

    2. Foreign Bank's Obligation under the Letter of Credit or the 
Related Obligation:

 
 
 
(a).............................  Principal due        $100,000.00
                                   January 31.
                                  Interest due         $10,000.00
                                   January 31 (10%  x
                                    $100,000).
                                                      ------------------
 
                                  Amount owed by       $110,000.00
                                   foreign bank as of
                                   January 31.
(b).............................  Penalty interest     $795.62
                                   due (12% per annum
                                   for 22 days  x
                                   $100,000).
                                                      ------------------
(c).............................  Amount owed by       $110,795.62
                                   foreign bank as of
                                   February 22.
 

    3. Amount of Foreign Bank's Obligation Not Covered by CCC's Payment 
Guarantee: $4,668.55

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the foreign bank obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the foreign bank is 
$110,000, CCC would be entitled to 95.75 percent ($106,063.07 divided by 
$110,765.62) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be entitled 
to 4.21 percent ($4,668.55 divided by $110,795.62) of any recoveries of 
losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this example, the losses 
were recovered after the claim has been paid by CCC, Sec. 1493.130(b) 
would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.140  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to 
such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment 
must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already 
paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless 
approved in advance by CCC, be:
    (i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties or
    (ii) Subject to further assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases

[[Page 595]]

where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive 
an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC 
will provide notice thereof, to the financial institution and to the 
exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of an acknowledgment of 
assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC; or
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial institution:
    (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in 
sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees. CCC may, with 
the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under 
the payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the 
exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for 
the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other 
than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those 
alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in 
rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the 
payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the 
amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment 
guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, must 
maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and 
deliveries of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with a GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, 
including those records generated and maintained by agents, intervening 
purchasers, and related companies involved in special arrangements with 
the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General 
of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be 
given full and complete access to the premises of the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from 
the effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such 
five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the 
exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's or 
related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions 
relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, 
financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, 
processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and 
unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized 
representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside 
the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain 
directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in 
connection with the payment guarantee.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by 
Sec. 1493.100(b),

[[Page 596]]

and must provide access to such documentation if requested by the 
Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the five-
year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and Notices to 
Participants relating to the GSM-102 or GSM-103 program, as applicable. 
Applicants for payment guarantees under these programs are hereby on 
notice that they will be bound by any terms contained in applicable 
Program Announcements or Notices to Participants issued prior to the 
date of approval of a payment guarantee.
    (g) Submission of documents by principal officers. All required 
submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or 
requests (i.e., requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' 
assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of 
the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In 
cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal or the 
officer, the signature must be accompanied by: wording indicating the 
delegation of authority or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of 
the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized 
person or officer. Further, the exporter or exporter's assignee must 
ensure that all information/reports required under these regulations are 
submitted within the required time limits. If requested in writing, CCC 
will acknowledge receipt of a submission by the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment of receipt is requested, the 
exporter or exporter's assignee must submit an extra copy of each 
document and a stamped self-addressed envelope for return by U.S. mail. 
If courier services are desired for the return receipt, the exporter or 
exporter's assignee must also submit a self-addressed courier service 
order which includes the recipient's billing code for such service.
    (h) Officials not to benefit. No member of or delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the 
payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this 
provision shall not be construed to extend to the payment guarantee if 
made with a corporation for its general benefit.
    (i) OMB control number assigned pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act. The information collection requirements contained in this part (7 
CFR part 1493) have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have 
been assigned OMB Control Number 0551-0004.

sector ownership of the project;
    (25) The exporter's signature.
    (b) Application fee. The exporter shall pay the application fee 
specified in the program announcement at the time the application is 
submitted. An application will not be considered without payment of the 
specified fee. The application fee is nonrefundable.
    (c) Letter of preliminary commitment. CCC will determine whether, in 
its judgment, the project in connection with which the exporter seeks a 
facility payment guarantee is likely to increase exports of U.S. 
agricultural commodities or products to an emerging market; and whether 
the project is likely to benefit primarily U.S. agricultural commodities 
or products as opposed to commodities or products originating in other 
countries. If necessary, CCC may seek additional information from an 
applicant prior to making its determination. If CCC determines that an 
application meets these standards and appears to represent, in CCC's 
judgment, the best use of available resources, CCC will respond to the 
applicant with a letter of preliminary commitment indicating CCC's 
interest in issuing a facility payment guarantee conditioned on its 
approval of the exporter's final application.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.250  Final application and issuance of a facility payment guarantee.

    (a) Final application. An exporter who has received a letter of 
preliminary commitment may, within six months of the date of such 
letter, submit a final application to CCC for a facility payment 
guarantee which shall include the following information:
    (1) A cover sheet with the title: ``Application for a Facility 
Payment Guarantee--Final Commitment.''
    (2) A letterhead statement from the importer's bank or other 
documentation confirming the importer has the financial ability to 
comply with the initial payment requirement in Sec. 1493.230(c);
    (3) Written evidence of a firm sale signed by the exporter and the 
importer, specifying at minimum, the following information: Goods or 
services to be exported, quantities of such items, delivery terms (e.g., 
FOB, CFR, CIF), delivery period(s), contract value, payment terms, and 
date of sale. A sales contract may be contingent upon obtaining a 
facility payment guarantee;
    (4) A description of any changes in the information submitted in the 
preliminary application; and
    (5) The exporter's signature;
    (b) Additional information. CCC shall have the right to request the 
exporter to furnish any other information and documentation it deems 
pertinent to the evaluation of the exporter's final application for a 
final commitment.

[[Page 601]]

CCC may request from the exporter an independent engineering study or 
economic feasibility study relating to the project.
    (c) Final commitment letter. After making a favorable determination 
on the exporter's submissions, CCC will issue a final commitment letter 
indicating the applicable exposure fee rate and stating that CCC is 
prepared to issue a facility payment guarantee upon receiving full 
payment of the exposure fee within an allotted time. The letter will 
also indicate the key terms and coverage of the guarantee to be issued. 
CCC will also inform exporters in writing when it denies their request 
for a facility payment guarantee.
    (d) Exposure fee. The exposure fee is calculated by multiplying the 
requested guaranteed value (up to the maximum established by CCC's final 
commitment letter) by the exposure fee rate. Once the facility payment 
guarantee is issued to the exporter, CCC will ordinarily not refund the 
exposure fee. If CCC does not issue a facility payment guarantee, or 
issues a guarantee for only part of the coverage requested, CCC will 
make a full or pro rata refund of the exposure fee, as appropriate.
    (e) Issuance of the facility payment guarantee. Upon receipt of the 
exposure fee, CCC will issue a facility payment guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.260  Facility payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's maximum obligation. CCC will agree to pay the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee an amount not to exceed the guaranteed value 
stipulated on the face of the facility payment guarantee, plus eligible 
interest, in the event that the foreign bank fails to pay under the 
foreign bank letter of credit or related obligation. The exact amount of 
CCC's liability in the event of default will be determined in accordance 
with Sec. 1493.310(b).
    (b) Calculation of maximum guarantee coverage. CCC will determine 
the maximum amount of its obligation under a facility payment guarantee 
by calculating a:
    (1) Net contract value equal to the contract value minus:
    (i) The value of goods that are not U.S. goods; and
    (ii) The cost of services that are not U.S. services (except those 
services the exporter requests CCC to determine are vital to the success 
of the project and approved to be included in the net contract value);
    (2) Facility base value equal to net contract value minus:
    (i) The amount to be paid in accordance with the initial payment 
requirement in Sec. 1493.230(c); and
    (ii) The amount of discounts and allowances; and
    (3) Maximum guaranteed value equal to:
    (i) A principal amount determined by multiplying the facility base 
value (as determined in Sec. 1493.260(b)(2)) by the guaranteed 
percentage specified in the program announcement; and
    (ii) Interest on such principal amount at the rate specified in the 
applicable program announcement, not to exceed the investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 52-week bill auction in effect at that time.
    (c) Value and cost. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Value means declared customs value of the goods; or, in the 
absence of specific information regarding declared customs value, the 
fair market wholesale value of the imported goods in the United States 
at the time they were acquired by the participant; and
    (2) Cost means actual amount paid by the exporter for the services 
in an arms-length transaction; or in the absence of an arms-length 
transaction, the fair market value of the services at the time the 
services were provided.
    (d) U.S. content test. (1) CCC will issue a guarantee only if the 
following items collectively represent less than 50 percent of the net 
contract value in Sec. 1493.260(b)(1):
    (i) The value of imported components (except for raw materials) that 
are assembled, processed, or manufactured into U.S. goods included in 
the net contract value;
    (ii) The cost of services that are not U.S. services (including 
freight on foreign flag carriers and transportation insurance registered 
with foreign agents) that, at the request of the exporter, CCC 
determines are vital to the success of the project and approves

[[Page 602]]

their inclusion in the net contract value;
    (2) For purpose of this subsection, minor or cosmetic procedures 
(e.g., affixing labels, cleaning, painting, polishing) do not qualify as 
assembling, processing or manufacturing;
    (3) For purpose of this subsection, local services which involve 
costs for hotels, meals, transportation, and other similar services 
incurred in the emerging market are not U.S. services.
    (e) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to the period beginning on the date(s) of export(s) and will continue 
during the credit term specified in the facility payment guarantee. For 
goods, the period of coverage will also apply from the date on which 
interest begins to accrue, if earlier than the date of export. The final 
payments of principal and interest by the foreign bank must come due 
within the period of guarantee coverage.
    (f) Terms of the CCC facility payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's 
coverage will be set forth in the facility payment guarantee and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
program announcement(s) or notice(s) to participants in effect at the 
time the facility payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (g) Final date to export. The final date to export will be stated in 
the facility payment guarantee.
    (h) Ineligible exports. Goods or services with a date of export 
prior to the date CCC issues the facility payment guarantee are 
ineligible for coverage unless approved by the GSM.
    (i) Additional requirements. The facility payment guarantee may 
contain such additional terms, conditions, and limitations as are deemed 
necessary or desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the facility payment guarantee, are binding 
on the exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (j) Amendments. Exporters must notify CCC of any amendments 
concerning contracts covered by a facility payment guarantee. CCC will 
determine if the contract amendments will require amendments to the 
facility payment guarantee. Amending the facility payment guarantee may 
result in an increase to the exposure fee. Requests made by the exporter 
to amend the facility payment guarantee so as to change the guaranteed 
value must have the concurrence of the assignee when an assignment has 
been made.
    (k) Effective date. The facility payment guarantee shall become 
effective on the date of export of the goods or services.

Appendix to Sec. 1493.260--Illustration of FGP Coverage of Imported Raw 
     Materials, Components, and Services That Are Not U.S. Services

    The following example illustrates CCC's regulations and policy 
options with regard to issuing a payment guarantee for a project which 
includes imported raw materials, imported components, and services that 
are not U.S. services:
    1. Ten grain trucks and one truck scale are to be exported from the 
U.S. to an emerging market. The trucks will provide the ability to 
purchase larger quantities of grain from the U.S. The contract value 
totals $2,025,000, cost, insurance and freight (CIF) basis.
    2. The fenders, hoods and doors of the trucks have been manufactured 
and assembled in the U.S. and contain some imported raw materials (sheet 
metal).
    3. Imported components consist of starters and alternators, with a 
U.S. customs valuation of $149,000. These items are installed into the 
trucks in the U.S.
    4. The truck scale was imported from Canada into the U.S. with a 
U.S. customs valuation of $20,000.
    5. A U.S. citizen, will travel on a foreign airline carrier to the 
emerging market (airfare is $1,000) to instruct mechanics in repair and 
maintenance of the trucks. He will be paid a salary for this service 
and, in addition, will be reimbursed separately for local costs in the 
emerging market (e.g., hotel, meals, transportation) which are estimated 
to be $5,000.
    6. The trucks are to be shipped on foreign flag vessels, and the 
marine insurance is to be placed with a foreign agent. The combined cost 
of these services that are not U.S. services for which the exporter 
seeks coverage is estimated to be $500,000.

          CCC's Approval of Services That Are Not U.S. Services

    CCC agrees to include in the net contract value the foreign flag 
freight and marine insurance ($500,000) and the airfare ($1,000) of the 
U.S. instructor (Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)).

[[Page 603]]

                    Calculation of Net Contract Value

    CCC will calculate the net contract value by subtracting from the 
contract value ($2,025,000) the U.S. customs value of the truck scale 
($20,000) in accordance with Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)(I) and the local costs 
to be incurred by the U.S. instructor ($5,000) in accordance with 
Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)(ii) to equal $2,000,000.

             CCC's Determination of U.S. Content Eligibility

    The imported components and services that are not U.S. services 
approved for coverage total $650,000 (i.e., $149,000 for starters and 
alternators, $1,000 for airfare, $500,000 for freight and insurance; or 
32.5 percent of the net contract value of $2,000,000 
(Sec. 1493.260(b)(1)). Since this is less than 50 percent of the net 
contract value the transaction meets the U.S. content test 
(Sec. 1493.260(d)).


<R05>

    (3) Within 30 days of the date of export of services.
    (d) Late reports. If the evidence of export report is not received 
by CCC within the time period for filing, the facility payment guarantee 
will become null and void only if and only to the extent that failure to 
make timely filing resulted, or would likely result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the FGP;
    (3) The obstruction of the fair administration of the FGP; or
    (4) A threat to the integrity of the FGP.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.290  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of goods covered by a facility payment 
guarantee to a country other than that shown on the facility payment

<R05>
Sec. 1493.300  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the foreign bank 
letter of credit or related obligation, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but 
not later than ten days after the date that payment was due from the 
foreign bank (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in 
writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts 
P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's assignee fails to promptly notify 
CCC of defaults in accordance with this paragraph, CCC may make the 
facility payment guarantee null and void with respect to any payment(s) 
applicable to such default. This time limit may be extended only under 
extraordinary circumstances and if approved by the Controller, CCC. The 
notice of default must include:
    (1) Facility payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the emerging market;
    (3) Name of the defaulting bank;
    (4) Payment due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately

[[Page 605]]

    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must 
be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified 
in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following 
information and documents:
    (1) Facility payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue and the interest rate on the foreign 
bank obligation applicable to the claim; and
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i)(A) The foreign bank's letter of credit securing the export sale, 
and;
    (B) If applicable, the document(s) evidencing the related obligation 
owed by the foreign bank to the assignee financial institution which is 
related to the foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the 
exporter.
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill; 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the emerging market;
    (iii) The exporter's sales invoice(s) showing the value and basis of 
sale (e.g., FOB, CFR, or CIF) or, if services are billed separately, 
documents that the exporter or its assignee relied upon in extending the 
credit to the issuing foreign bank;
    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default. 
The instrument must reference the applicable foreign bank letter of 
credit and the related obligation, if applicable; and
    (v) A copy of the evidence of export report(s) previously submitted 
by the exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.280.
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. The exporter or 
an exporter's assignee need only provide one claim which meets full 
documentation requirements relating to a covered transaction. For 
subsequent claims relating to such failures of the foreign bank to make 
scheduled installments on the same export, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure 
containing the information stated in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (3) of 
this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) 
of this section, and the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.310  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.300, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the facility payment guarantee, this subpart, program 
announcement(s) and notice(s) to participants. If CCC determines that it 
is liable to the exporter or the exporter's assignee, CCC will pay the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee in accordance with paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. CCC's maximum liability for any 
claims for loss submitted with respect to any facility payment 
guarantee, not including any late interest payments due in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the facility payment 
guarantee, plus eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the facility payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export 
report (Sec. 1493.280(a)(7)), plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the claim was found by CCC to be in 
good order and continuing

[[Page 606]]

until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. Late interest 
will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will be calculated based on the 
latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill 
auction as announced by the Department of Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the 
foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed by the foreign 
bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the 
foreign bank's letter of credit issued in favor of the exporter, unless 
it is determined to be in the best interest of CCC by the Controller, 
CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the 
entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default 
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition 
to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to the value of goods or 
services covered by a facility payment guarantee, CCC will not hold the 
assignee responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the 
assignee for any action, omission or statement by the exporter of which 
the assignee has no knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Sec. 1493.270 and Sec. 1493.280 excluding post-export adjustments (i.e., 
corrections of evidence of export reports); and
    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.300.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.320  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights 
under the subrogation agreement to recover all monies in default.
    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer, the foreign bank or any other source whatsoever, such 
monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies 
are not received by CCC within 15 days from the date of recovery by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date 
of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest 
average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day auction, as 
announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of 
recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be 
charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a facility 
payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay 
the holder of the facility payment guarantee its pro rata share 
immediately, provided that the required information necessary for 
determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not 
made by CCC within 15 days from the date of recovery or 15 days from 
receiving the required information for determining pro rata 
distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of 
payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the 
recovery payable to the holder of the facility payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the 
exporter, the exporter's assignee or any other source whatsoever, will 
be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to 
CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such 
recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on 
a pro rata basis, based on the combined

[[Page 607]]

amount of principal and interest in default. Once CCC has paid out a 
particular claim under a facility payment guarantee, CCC prorates any 
collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately 
with the holder of the guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the 
guarantee have been reimbursed in full. Appendix to Sec. 1493.320 
provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in applying this 
paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
facility payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any 
amounts paid by CCC under the facility payment guarantee when and if it 
is determined by CCC that the exporter engaged in fraud, or has been or 
is in breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the facility payment 
guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under the FGP. Further, the 
exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC 
under the facility payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC 
that the exporter's assignee engaged in fraud or otherwise violated 
program requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Sec. 1493.270 or the failure of an exporter to comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 1493.290 or Sec. 1493.330(e) will not affect the 
validity of any facility payment guarantee with respect to an assignee 
which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the 
time such exporter applied for the facility payment guarantee or at the 
time of assignment of the facility payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the foreign 
bank or the importer.

   Appendix to Sec. 1493.320--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.320, regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for claims 
filed under the FGP. For the purpose of this example only, even though 
CCC interest coverage is on a floating rate basis, a constant rate of 
interest is assumed. A typical case might be as follows:
    1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit 
arrangement for the export sale of goods and services with the foreign 
bank calling for equal semi-annual payments of principal and semi-annual 
payment of interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum and a penalty 
interest rate of 12 percent per annum on overdue amounts until the 
overdue amount is paid.
    2. Exported value reported to CCC equals $300,000.
    3. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of 
$50,000 and an interest payment of $2,493.15, both due on January 31.
    4. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a notice of default and claim 
in good order with CCC.
    5. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
95 percent of the principal amount due ($47,500) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 95 percent of the principal 
($1,894.80).
    6. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    7. The latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury Bill auction 
average which has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect 
on the date of nonpayment by CCC (February 11) is 7 percent.

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the facility 
payment guarantee would be computed as follows:

1. CCC's Obligation under the Facility Payment Guarantee:
    (a) Principal coverage--(95%  x  $50,000)..............   $47,500.00
    (b) Interest coverage--(8%  x  $47,500  x  182/365)....     1,894.80
������������������������������������������������������������
    (c) Late interest due from CCC (7% per annum for 11           104.20
     days  x  $49,394.80)..................................
 
 
        Interest due January 31 (10%  x  $ 50,000  x  182/      2,493.15
         365)..............................................
------------------------------------------------------------
    (b) Penalty interest due (12% per annum for 22 days  x        361.64
     $ 50,000).............................................
------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 608]]

 
3. Amount of Foreign Bank's Obligation Not Covered by CCC's    3,355.79.
 Payment Guarantee:........................................
 

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the foreign bank obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the foreign bank is 
$52,854.79, CCC would be entitled to 93.65 percent ($49,499.00 divided 
by $52,854.79) and the holder of the facility payment guarantee would be 
entitled to 6.35 percent ($3,355.79 divided by $52,854.79) of any 
recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this 
example, the losses were recovered after the claim had been paid by CCC, 
Sec. 1493.320(b) would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.330  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a facility payment guarantee or the 
right to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The 
assignment must cover all amounts payable under the facility payment 
guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and 
may not, unless approved in advance by CCC, be subject to further 
assignment. Any assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee 
for two or more parties participating in the assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be 
ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, CCC will provide notice thereof to such financial 
institution and to the exporter issued the facility payment guarantee in 
lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a facility payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC; or
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a facility payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial 
institution:
    (1) At the time of assignment of a facility payment guarantee, is 
not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a 
branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or
    (4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of 
credit.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of facility payment guarantees. CCC 
may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds 
payable under the facility payment guarantee has been assigned, with the 
agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms or 
conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a facility 
payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC 
determines that those alternative procedures, terms or conditions are 
appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction 
covered by the facility payment guarantee and would not result in CCC 
paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a facility 
payment guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee,

[[Page 609]]

as applicable, must maintain and make available all records pertaining 
to sales and deliveries of and extension of credit for goods or services 
exported in connection with a facility payment guarantee, including 
those records generated and maintained by agents, and related companies 
involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through 
their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access 
to the premises of the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as 
applicable, during regular business hours from the effective date of the 
facility payment guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period 
to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the exporter's, 
exporter's assignee's, or a related company's books, records, and 
accounts concerning transactions relating to the facility payment 
guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts 
pertaining to sales, inventory, manufacturing, processing, and 
administrative and incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by 
Sec. 1493.290(b), and must provide access to such document if requested 
by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the 
five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves 
with, this subpart, program announcement(s), and notice(s) to 
participants relating to the FGP, as applicable. Applicants for facility

<R05>
Sec. 1493.400  General statement.

    (a) Overview. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing 
the operations of the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP). The 
restrictions and criteria set forth at subpart A for the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and 
the Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) will apply to this 
subpart. The SCGP was developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by 
making available payment guarantees to encourage U.S. exporters to 
extend financing on credit terms of not more than 180 days to importers 
of U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (2) The SCGP operates in cases where credit is necessary to increase 
or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private U.S. 
exporters would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's 
guarantee. The program is operated in a manner intended not to interfere 
with markets for cash sales. The program is targeted toward those 
countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the 
exports but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign 
exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this 
credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for 
U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for 
U.S. agricultural commodities.
    (3) The credit facility created by this program is the SCGP payment 
guarantee (payment guarantee). The payment guarantee is an agreement by 
CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take 
assignment of the exporter's right to proceeds, specified amounts of 
principal and, where applicable, interest due from, but not paid by, the 
importer incurring the obligation in connection with the export sale to 
which CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, 
rather than government, financing and incurs a substantial portion of 
the risk of default by the importer. CCC assumes this risk, in order to 
be able to operate the program for the purposes specified in 
Sec. 1493.2.
    (b) Credit facility mechanism. (1) For the purpose of the SCGP, CCC 
will consider applications for payment guarantees only in connection 
with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for 
the agricultural commodities will be made under an unconditional and 
irrevocable importer obligation to a U.S. exporter payable in U.S. 
dollars, as defined in Sec. 1493.410(n).
    (2) The exporter may assign the right to proceeds under the importer 
obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the 
exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred 
payment date(s) as set forth in the importer obligation.
    (3) The SCGP payment guarantee is designed to protect the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment 
guarantee resulting from defaults, whether for commercial or 
noncommercial reasons, by the importer under the importer's obligation.
    (c) Program administration. The SCGP will be administered pursuant 
to subpart A and this subpart and any Program Announcements and Notices 
to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent with, 
this subpart. This program is under the general administrative 
responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS/USDA). The review and payment of claims for loss will be 
administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding 
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, 
and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular USDA or CCC offices, 
will be announced by a public press release (see Sec. 1493.410(c), 
``Contacts P/R'').
    (d) Country allocations and program announcements. From time to 
time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a SCGP 
allocation for a specific country. The Program Announcement for a 
country allocation will designate specific allocations for U.S. 
agricultural commodities or products thereof, will indicate the form of 
promissory note required by CCC, and will provide other pertinent 
information. Exporters may negotiate export sales to importers in that 
country for one of the commodities specified in the

[[Page 611]]

Program Announcement and seek payment guarantee coverage within the 
dollar amounts of specified coverage for that commodity. The Program 
Announcement will contain a requirement that the exporter's sales 
contract contain a shipping deadline within the applicable program year. 
The final date for a contractual shipping deadline will be stated in the 
Program Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified 
``undesignated'' or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that 
if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country 
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or 
``undesignated'' portion of the total country allocation may then be 
designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include 
an ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain 
further information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion 
of the country allocation.

chooses, a request for CCC to reserve coverage up to the maximum 
quantity permitted by the contract loading tolerance;
    (9) Unit sales price of the commodity, or a mechanism to establish 
the price, as agreed between the exporter and the importer. If the 
commodity was sold on the basis of CFR or CIF, the actual (if known at 
the time of application) or estimated value of freight and, in the case 
of sales made on a CIF basis, the actual (if known at the time of 
application) or estimated value of marine and war risk insurance, must 
be specified;

GSM will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the 
exporter. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time 
specified in Sec. 1493.450(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit 
sales price of the commodity does not fall within the prevailing 
commercial market level ranges, as determined by CCC, the application 
will not be approved.
    (c) Ineligible exporter. An exporter will be ineligible to obtain a 
payment guarantee if such exporter:
    (1) Directly or indirectly owns or controls the importer;
    (2) Is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the importer;

for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in 
Sec. 1493.430(a)(17), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the 
payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.410(x).
    (b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law;
    (c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable 
oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been

pursuant to section 313 of

[[Page 616]]

the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed 
under Federal law on an imported commodity or product;
    (d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to 
solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement 
or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent 
fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established

    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.420, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications 
with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, 
notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul 
guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to 
proceed against the exporter.

<R05>
Sec. 1493.450  Payment guarantee.

    (a) CCC's obligation. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC 
agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to 
exceed the guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that 
the importer fails to pay under the importer obligation. unless CCC 
determines with respect to the particular transaction and claim that the 
guaranteed portion of the port value exceeded the prevailing U.S. market 
value for the same, or same type of agricultural commodity or product. 
In making this determination, CCC will adjust the prevailing U.S. market 
value for estimated freight and/or insurance costs if the export sale 
was made on a CFR or CIF basis. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.
    (b) Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply 
to a credit period not exceeding 180 days beginning either on the 
date(s) of export(s) or from the date when interest begins to accrue 
whichever is earlier, and will continue during the credit term specified 
in the payment guarantee or amendments thereto. However, the payment 
guarantee becomes effective on the date(s) of export(s) of the 
agricultural commodities or products thereof specified in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee.
    (c) Terms of the CCC payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's coverage 
will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will 
include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any 
Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the 
time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.
    (d) Final date to export. The final date to export shown on the 
payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the 
contractual deadline for shipping.
    (e) Reserve coverage for loading tolerances. The exporter may apply 
for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee 
fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the 
export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC 
reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of 
the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If 
such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of 
application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so 
indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a 
quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid 
(i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage 
from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing 
for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional 
amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is 
not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the 
last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve 
the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.
    (f) Ineligible exports. Commodities with a date of export prior to 
the date

[[Page 617]]

of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written application 
for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after the final 
date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any amendments 
thereof, are ineligible for guarantee coverage under this subpart, 
except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of 
CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.
    (g) Foreign agricultural component. CCC may approve payment 
guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United 
States agricultural commodities as defined in Sec. 1493.410(x). CCC may 
not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for 
the value of any foreign agricultural component.
    (h) Additional requirements. The payment guarantee may contain such 
additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or 
desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or 
qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee.
    (i) Amendments. A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee 
may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the 
assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the 
amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable 
Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may 
include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and 
an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, 
particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under 
the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. 
(Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be 
submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as 
amendments.)


<R05>
Sec. 1493.460  Guarantee rates and fees.

    (a) Guarantee fee rates. The current payment guarantee fee rate(s) 
will be available by Program Announcement.
    (b) Calculation of fee. The guarantee fee will be computed by 
multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.
    (c) Payment of fee. The exporter shall remit, with his written 
application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not 
be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The 
exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and 
mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts 
P/R.
    (d) Refunds of fee. Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved 
applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the 
application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be 
made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be 
in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee 
is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage 
requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.470  Evidence of export.

    (a) Report of export. The exporter is required to provide CCC an 
evidence of export report for each shipment made under the payment 
guarantee. This report must include the following:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Date of export;
    (3) Exporter's sale number;
    (4) Exported value;
    (5) Quantity;
    (6) A full description of the commodity exported;
    (7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the 
basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price at export 
differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's 
application for a payment guarantee, the exporter is also required to 
submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference;
    (8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any;
    (9) Number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under any other program 
if any portion of the export sale was also approved for participation in 
any of the following CCC or USDA export program: Export Enhancement 
Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance 
Program, or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program; and
    (10) The exporter's statement, ``ALL SECTION 1493.480 CERTIFICATIONS

[[Page 618]]

ARE BEING MADE IN THIS EVIDENCE OF EXPORT'' which, when included in the 
evidence of export by the exporter, will constitute a certification that 
it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 1493.480.
    (b) Time limit for submission of evidence of export. The exporter 
must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/
R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 
calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period 
for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of 
the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of 
export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, 
the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the 
extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely 
to result, in:
    (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;
    (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the 
program;
    (3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or
    (4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for 
submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such 
extension is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.
    (c) Export sales reporting. Exporters may have a mandatory reporting 
responsibility under section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, 
as amended (7 U.S.C. 5712) for exports of wheat and wheat flour, feed 
grains, oilseeds, cotton, and other agricultural commodities and 
products thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.480  Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

    By providing the statement contained in Sec. 1493.470(a)(10), the 
exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of 
export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements 
set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be 
required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to 
reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or 
violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, 
CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under 
this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet 
exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The exporter, in 
submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth 
in Sec. 1493.470(a)(10), certifies that:
    (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment 
guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by 
Sec. 1493.410(x).
    (b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity 
called for in the exporter's sales contract with the importer have been 
exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee;
    (c) There is an importer obligation as defined in Sec. 1493.410(n) 
to cover the exported value of the commodity exported;
    (d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or 
extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction 
provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, 
and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and
    (e) The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not 
changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements 
of Sec. 1493.420 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there 
is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such 
requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 1493.490  Proof of entry.

    (a) Diversion. The diversion of commodities covered by a SCGP 
payment guarantee to a country other than that shown on the payment 
guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.
    (b) Records of proof of entry. Exporters must obtain and maintain 
records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant 
authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be 
necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with the SCGP in the country that was the 
intended country of destination of

[[Page 619]]

such commodities. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be in 
English or be accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable 
to CCC. Records acceptable to meet this requirement include an original 
certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs or port 
official of the importing country, by the importer, by an agent or 
representative of the vessel or shipline which delivered the 
agricultural commodity to the importing country, or by a private 
surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation deemed 
acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (1) That the agricultural commodity entered the importing country;
    (2) The identification of the export carrier;
    (3) The quantity of the agricultural commodity;
    (4) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the agricultural 
commodity; and
    (5) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the agricultural 
commodity in the importing country. (Records of proof of entry need not 
be submitted with a claim for loss, except as may be provided in 
Sec. 1493.500(b)(4)(ii).)


<R05>
Sec. 1493.500  Notice of default and claims for loss.

    (a) Notice of default. If the importer fails to make payment 
pursuant to the terms of the importer obligation, the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as 
possible, but not later than 10 calendar days after the date that 
payment was due from the importer (the due date). A notice of default 
must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address 
specified in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with 
this paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with 
respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit 
may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if such 
extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best 
interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) Name of the country;
    (3) Name of the defaulting importer;
    (4) Due date;
    (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately 
the amounts for principal and interest;
    (6) Date of importer's refusal to pay, if applicable; and
    (7) Reason for importer's refusal to pay, if known.
    (b) Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or 
the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six 
months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must 
be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified 
in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following 
information and documents:
    (1) Payment guarantee number;
    (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been 
received;
    (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, 
the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the importer 
obligation applicable to the claim;
    (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document 
containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:
    (i) The importer obligation;
    (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean 
carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company 
with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, 
or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar 
document signed by an official of the importing country;
    (iii)(A) The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, 
FOB, CFR or CIF values; or
    (B) If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's 
invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's 
invoice to the importer;
    (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, 
subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the 
exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default 
under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the 
applicable importer obligation; and

[[Page 620]]

    (v) A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the 
exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.470(a).
    (c) Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. If the initial 
claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee 
need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial 
claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating 
to failure of the importer to make scheduled installments on the same 
export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only 
submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated 
in paragraph (b) (1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of 
subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including 
the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.510  Payment for loss.

    (a) Determination of CCC's liability. Upon receipt in good order of 
the information and documents required under Sec. 1493.500, CCC will 
determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable 
under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable 
supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC 
determines that it is liable to the exporter and/or the exporter's 
assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Amount of CCC's liability. Subject to a determination by CCC 
with respect to prevailing U.S. market value pursuant to 
Sec. 1493.450(a) of this part, CCC's maximum liability for any claims 
for loss submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not including 
any late interest payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section, will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus 
eligible interest; or
    (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment 
guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export, 
plus eligible interest.
    (c) Late interest payment. If a claim is not paid within one day of 
receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late 
interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
beginning with the first day after the day of receipt of a claim found 
by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date 
that payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the 
guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section, and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of 
the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the 
Department of Treasury as of the due date.
    (d) Accelerated payments. CCC will pay claims only for losses on 
amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due 
under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract or the 
importer obligation unless it is determined to be in the best interests 
of CCC by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its 
option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued 
interest, in default and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from 
CCC.
    (e) Action against the assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision 
in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a 
payment guarantee, CCC will not, except pursuant to a determination 
under Sec. 1493.450(a) of this part, hold the assignee responsible or 
take any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any 
action, omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has 
no knowledge, provided that:
    (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under 
Secs. 1493.470 and 1493.480, excluding post-export adjustments (i.e., 
corrections to evidence of export reports); and
    (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements 
and documents specified in Sec. 1493.500.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.520  Recovery of losses.

    (a) Notification. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the importer of CCC's rights under 
the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.

[[Page 621]]

    (b) Receipt of monies. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted 
payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from 
the importer or any other source whatsoever, such monies shall be 
immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies are not received 
by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the exporter 
or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will 
owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt by 
CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest average 
investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as 
announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of 
recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be 
charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.
    (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment 
guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the 
holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided 
that the required information necessary for determining pro rata 
distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 
business days from the date of recovery or 15 business days from 
receiving the required information for determining pro rata 
distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on 
the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day 
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on 
the date of recovery and such interest will accrue from such date to the 
date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of 
the recovery payable to the holder of the payment guarantee.
    (c) Allocation of recoveries. Recoveries made by CCC from the 
importer, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the 
exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated 
by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to CCC on a pro 
rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. 
The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata 
basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in 
default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment 
guarantee, CCC pro rates any collections it receives and shares these 
collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both 
CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. 
Appendix A to Sec. 1493.520--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
Recoveries--provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in 
applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Liabilities to CCC. Notwithstanding any other terms of the 
payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts 
paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by 
CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in 
material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty 
made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee 
or for fulfilling obligations under SCGP. Further, the exporter's 
assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the 
payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the 
exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program 
requirements.
    (e) Good faith. The violation by an exporter of the certifications 
in Secs. 1493.440(b) and 1493.480(d) or the failure of an exporter to 
comply with the provisions of Secs. 1493.490 or 1493.530(e) will not 
affect the validity of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee 
which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the 
time such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of 
assignment of the payment guarantee.
    (f) Cooperation in recoveries. Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the 
exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the importer.

  Appendix A to Sec. 1493.520--Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of 
                               Recoveries

    The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in 
Sec. 1493.520(c), regarding pro rata sharing of recoveries made for 
claims filed under the SCGP. A typical case might be as follows:

[[Page 622]]

    1. The U.S. exporter enters into a $200,000, 180 day credit 
arrangement with the importer calling for two equal payments of 
principal and two equal payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per 
annum and a penalty interest rate of 12 percent per annum (basis 360 
days) on overdue amounts until the overdue amount is paid. (Basis for 
interest calculation may be 360 or 365 days.)
    2. The importer fails to make the final principal payment of 
$100,000 and an interest payment of $2,500.00 (10% per annum for 90 days 
on $100,000), both due on January 31.
    3. On February 10, the U.S. exporter files a claim in good order 
with CCC.
    4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 
60 percent of the principal amount due ($60,000) and interest at a rate 
of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 60 percent of the principal 
outstanding ($1,183.56) (8% per annum for 90 days on $60,000). (CCC's 
basis for interest calculation is 365 days.)
    5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
    6. The average investment rate of the most recent 91-day Treasury 
Bill auction average which has been published by the Department of 
Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment by CCC (January 31) is 7 
percent. (CCC's late interest rate.)

                       Computation of Obligations

    Using the above case, CCC's payment to the holder of the payment 
guarantee would be computed as follows:

1. CCC's Obligation under the Payment Guarantee:
    (a) Principal coverage--(60% $100,000)...........         $60,000.00
    (b) Interest coverage--(8% per annum for 90 days            1,183.56
     on $60,000, basis 365 days).....................
������������������������������������������������������
    (c) Late interest due from CCC (7% per annum for              129.07
     11 days on $61,183.56, basis 365 days)..........
 
 
        Interest due January 31 (10% per annum for 90           2,500.00
         days on $100,000, basis 360 days)...........
------------------------------------------------------
    (b) Penalty interest due (12% per annum for 22                751.67
     days on $102,500.00, basis 360 days)............
------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of importer's obligation not covered by
 CCC's payment guarantee: $41,939.04 ($103,251.67-
 $61,312.63).........................................
 

          Computation of Pro Rata Sharing in Recovery of Losses

    In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of 
losses, the total amount due under the importer obligation would be 
determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using 
the above example in which the amount owed by the importer is 
$103,251.67, CCC would be entitled to 59.38 percent ($61,312.63 divided 
by $103,251.67) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be 
entitled to 40.62 percent ($41,939.04 divided by $103,251.67) of any 
recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this 
example, the losses were recovered after the claim has been paid by CCC, 
Sec. 1493.520(b) would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 1493.530  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignment. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, 
or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to 
such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment 
must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already 
paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless 
approved in advance by CCC, be:
    (i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties; or
    (ii) Subject to further assignment.
    (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment 
signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the 
Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
    (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be 
acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer 
of CCC. In cases

[[Page 623]]

where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive 
an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC 
will provide notice thereof, to the financial institution and to the 
exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of an acknowledgment of 
assignment.
    (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the 
written notice of assignment.
    (b) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an 
assignment. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an 
assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a payment 
guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
    (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the 
Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
entity issuing the importer obligation.
    (c) Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds. A 
financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable 
under a payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial institution:
    (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in 
sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;
    (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or
    (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the 
entity issuing the importer obligation.
    (d) Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees. CCC may, with 
the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under 
the payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the 
exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for 
the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other 
than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those 
alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in 
rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the 
payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the 
amount of CCC's obligation.
    (e) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment 
guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, must 
maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and 
deliveries of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities 
exported in connection with a payment guarantee, including those records 
generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and related 
companies involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The 
Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United 
States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and 
complete access to the premises of the exporter or the exporter's 
assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the 
effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such 
five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the 
exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's, or 
related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions 
relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, 
financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, 
processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and 
unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee 
may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized 
representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside 
the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain 
directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in 
connection with the payment guarantee.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by 
Sec. 1493.490(b), and must provide access to such documentation if 
requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized 
representative for the five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (f) Responsibility of program participants. It is the responsibility 
of all program participants to review, and fully

[[Page 624]]

acquaint themselves with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and 
Notices to Participants issued pursuant to this subpart. Applicants for 
payment guarantees are hereby on notice that they will be bound by any 
terms contained in applicable Program Announcements or Notices to 
Participants issued prior to the date of approval of a payment 
guarantee.
    (g) Submission of documents by principal officers. All required 
submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or 
requests (i.e., requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' 
assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of 
the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In 
cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal or the 
officer, the signature must be accompanied by: Wording indicating the 
delegation of authority or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of 
the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized 
person or officer. Further, the exporter or exporter's assignee must 
ensure that all information/reports required under these regulations are 
submitted within the required time limits. If requested in writing, CCC 
will acknowledge receipt of a submission by the exporter or the 
exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment of receipt is requested, the 
exporter or exporter's assignee must submit an extra copy of each 
document and a stamped self-addressed envelope for return by U.S. mail. 
If courier services are desired for the return receipt, the exporter or 
exporter's assignee must also submit a self-addressed courier service 
order which includes the recipient's billing code for such service.
    (h) Officials not to benefit. No member of or delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the 
payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this 
provision shall not be construed to extend to the payment guarantee if 
made with a corporation for its general benefit.
    (i) OMB control number assigned pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act. The information requirements contained in this part (7 CFR part 
1493, subpart D) have been approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 
and have been assigned OMB Control Number 0551-0037.

Sec. 1494.10  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Commodity

[[Page 625]]

Credit Corporation's (CCC) Export Enhancement Program (EEP). These 
criteria are interrelated and will be considered together in order to 
select eligible commodities and eligible countries for EEP initiatives 
which will best meet the program's objectives. The objectives of the 
program are to discourage unfair trade practices by other countries, to 
increase U.S. agricultural commodity exports, and to encourage other 
countries exporting agricultural commodities to undertake serious 
negotiations on agricultural trade problems. Under the EEP, bonuses are 
made available by CCC to enable exporters to meet prevailing world 
prices for targeted commodities in targeted destinations. In the 
operation of the EEP, CCC will make reasonable efforts to avoid the 
displacement of usual marketings of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.20  Criteria.

    The criteria considered by CCC in reviewing proposals for 
initiatives will include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) The expected contribution of proposed initiatives in furthering 
trade policy negotiations and, in particular, in furthering the U.S. 
trade policy negotiating strategy of countering competitors' subsidies 
and other unfair trade practices by displacing such countries' 
subsidized exports in targeted countries;
    (b) The contribution which initiatives will make toward realizing 
U.S. agricultural export goals and, in particular, in developing, 
expanding, or maintaining markets for U.S. agricultural commodities;
    (c) The effect that sales facilitated by initiatives would have on 
non-subsidizing exporters of agricultural products; and
    (d) The subsidy requirements of proposed initiatives compared to the 
expected benefits.

<R05>
Sec. 1494.101  General statement.

    This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the 
Export Enhancement Program (EEP) of the Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC). CCC will, from time to time, announce, through public press 
release, initiatives to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural 
commodities to targeted markets. The public press release, which will 
contain the name of a person for interested parties to contact, will be 
followed by the issuance of an Invitation for Offers (Invitation). 
Invitations will be issued pursuant to this subpart by the General Sales 
Manager (GSM) and will specify the eligible country(ies) (the targeted 
market), the unit of measure, the eligible commodity, the maximum 
quantity of the eligible commodity eligible for a CCC bonus, the quality 
specifications of the eligible commodity (including possible 
restrictions on type, kind, grade and/or class or other quality 
specifications), the eligible buyer(s), the method and rate for 
determining liquidated damages and performance security requirements, 
and any other terms and conditions peculiar to that Invitation. 
Invitations may be one of the following two types: Those inviting 
exporters which have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to submit a 
competitive offer for a CCC Bonus; and those inviting exporters which 
have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to apply for an Announced 
CCC Bonus. After an interested person has qualified to submit an offer 
for an eligible commodity, the eligible exporter may submit an offer to 
CCC in response to an Invitation. Such offer must contain the 
information required by this subpart and any additional information 
required by the applicable Invitation. The exporter's offer will include 
either the Announced CCC Bonus, if applicable, or an amount in dollars 
and cents for a bonus deemed necessary by the exporter to make a 
commercial sale of the eligible commodity for export to the eligible 
country competitive with export sales of the commodity by other 
exporting countries to buyers in the eligible country. If the exporter 
has furnished the required performance security and the offer is 
acceptable to CCC, then CCC will notify the exporter that its

[[Page 626]]

offer has been accepted. CCC and the exporter will enter into an 
Agreement in which CCC will agree to pay the bonus to the exporter in 
return for the exporter's submission of proof that the eligible 
commodity has been exported from the United States and entered into the 
eligible country, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 1494.301  Information required for program participation.

    Before CCC will consider an offer from an interested person, such 
person must qualify for participation in the program. Based upon 
information submitted by the interested person and available from public 
sources, CCC will determine whether the interested person is eligible 
for participation in the program.
    (a) Submission of documentation. An interested person that wishes to 
qualify as an eligible exporter must furnish the following information 
or documentation to CCC at the address referenced in the Notice to 
Exporters--EEP Contacts:
    (1) The address of the interested person's office and the name and 
address of an agent in the U.S. for the service of process;
    (2) The legal form of doing business of the interested person, e.g., 
sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, etc.;
    (3) The place of incorporation of the interested person, if the 
interested person is a corporation;
    (4) The name and address of an office(s) of the interested person 
within the U.S., if the interested person is a foreign corporation or 
other foreign entity; and
    (5) A certified statement describing the interested person's 
participation, if any, during the past three years in U.S. Government 
programs, contracts or agreements.
    (6) The following certification: ``I certify, to the best of my 
knowledge and belief, that neither [name of interested person] nor any 
of its principals has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for 
debarment from contracting with or participating in programs 
administered by any U.S. Government agency. [``Principals,'' for the 
purpose of this certification, means officers; directors; owners of five 
percent or more of stock; partners; and persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibility within a business entity (e.g., 
general manager, plant manager, head of a subsidiary division or 
business segment, and similar positions).] I further agree that, should 
any such debarment, suspension, or notice of proposed debarment occur in 
the future,

[[Page 629]]

[name of interested person] will immediately notify CCC.''
    (b) Necessity to qualify. An interested person may not submit an 
offer, and CCC will not consider any such offer, until CCC has notified 
the interested person that such person has qualified as an eligible 
exporter.
    (c) Additional submissions. CCC will promptly notify interested 
persons that have submitted information required by this section whether 
they have qualified to have their offers considered. Any person failing 
to qualify will be notified of the basis of CCC's decision and will be 
given an opportunity to provide additional information for consideration 
by CCC.
    (d) Previous performance. CCC may request additional information 
with respect to the interested person's performance under any U.S. 
Government programs or in connection with any contracts or agreements 
with the U.S. Government during the past three years.
    (e) Ineligibility for program participation. A person may be 
ineligible to participate in the EEP if such person:
    (1) Is currently debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment from 
contracting with or participating in any program administered by a U.S. 
Government agency; or
    (2) Is controlled or can be controlled, in whole or in part, by any 
individuals or entities currently debarred, suspended or proposed for 
debarment from contracting with or participating in programs 
administered by a U.S. Government agency.
    (f) Duty to update information provided to CCC. An eligible exporter 
is under a continuing obligation to inform CCC of any changes in the 
information or documentation submitted to CCC pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section and to provide current and accurate information to CCC.
    (g) Payment of bonus to exporters without proven EEP participation. 
An eligible exporter that has not yet demonstrated its ability to 
participate successfully in the EEP will be eligible to receive a bonus 
payment(s) only after the eligible commodity specified in an EEP 
Agreement has entered into the eligible country. Such an exporter must 
furnish performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable 
Invitation and follow the procedure specified in Sec. 1494.701(d) to 
request the payment of the bonus. An eligible exporter may demonstrate 
its ability to participate successfully in the EEP by entering or 
causing to be entered into the eligible country at least 95% of the 
quantity of the eligible commodity specified in any one EEP Agreement. 
CCC will consider that an exporter has proven its ability to participate 
successfully in the EEP as of the date on which CCC pays to the exporter 
a bonus for entry of a quantity that brings the total entered quantity 
for any one EEP Agreement to at least 95%. For all EEP Agreements that 
such exporter enters into with CCC subsequent to that date, the exporter 
may furnish performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable 
Invitation and will be eligible to receive bonus payments in accordance 
with Sec. 1494.701(c).

[56 FR 25011, June 3, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 21039, May 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1494.401  Performance security.

    (a) Requirement to establish performance security. Prior to the 
submission of an offer to CCC in response to an Invitation, an eligible 
exporter must establish performance security, in a form which is 
acceptable to CCC, in order to guarantee the eligible exporter's 
faithful performance of the Agreement. If CCC enters into an Agreement 
with the eligible exporter, this performance security must remain in 
effect until its cancellation or reduction is authorized by CCC pursuant 
to paragraph (f) of this section. An offer made by an eligible exporter 
will not be considered if proof of the establishment of the performance 
security is not made available to CCC by 3 p.m. on the date for which 
the offer is submitted for consideration.
    (b) Form of performance security. The performance security must be 
acceptable to CCC and may be an irrevocable standby letter of credit, a 
bond, or a certified or cashier's check. If a standby letter of credit 
is furnished as performance security, the opening bank may be a U.S. 
bank or a foreign bank. If the standby letter of credit is opened by a 
foreign bank, it must be 100 percent confirmed by a U.S. bank. If a

[[Page 630]]

bond is furnished as performance security, the surety(ies) must be among 
those appearing on the list of approved sureties maintained by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury. If a cashier's or certified check is 
furnished as performance security, the bank issuing the cashier's or 
certified check must be a U.S. bank.
    (c) Amount of performance security. The amount of the performance 
security to be furnished to CCC in response to a particular Invitation 
will depend upon whether the eligible exporter intends to select 
``Option A'' or ``Option B'' for the timing of the bonus payment. If the 
eligible exporter furnishes performance security under ``Option A'' of 
the applicable Invitation, the eligible exporter may request payment of 
the bonus after export of the eligible commodity but before entry of the 
commodity into the eligible country. If the eligible exporter furnishes 
performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable Invitation, 
the eligible exporter may request payment of the bonus only after the 
exported eligible commodity has entered into the eligible country. The 
applicable Invitation will specify the exact amount of performance 
security for the eligible commodity required under either ``Option A'' 
or ``Option B'' and the method and rate for determining liquidated 
damages. After the exporter and CCC enter into an Agreement, the 
exporter may request CCC to change the performance security option for 
an entire Agreement from ``Option B'' to ``Option A'' and, if CCC agrees 
to this change, the exporter will increase the performance security 
amount to the level required by the applicable Invitation for ``Option 
A''.
    (d) Additional security. The exporter shall promptly furnish such 
additional security as CCC may determine is necessary to protect CCC 
under an Agreement if the surety(ies) or obligating bank:
    (1) Becomes unacceptable to the U.S. Government or CCC; and/or
    (2) Fails to furnish reports on its financial condition as required 
by the U.S. Government or CCC.
    (e) Right to funds under the performance security. If CCC enters 
into an Agreement with an exporter under the EEP, CCC will have the 
right to funds from the performance security established by the exporter 
for such Agreement to recover:
    (1) The amount of any bonus paid to the exporter under the Agreement 
if the exporter fails to perform in accordance with such Agreement;
    (2) Any funds owed by the exporter to CCC related to the specific 
EEP Agreement for which the performance security was established, 
including those for liquidated damages, discounts for late performance, 
overpayments made by CCC, storage charges, or other damages or charges 
as determined by CCC; and/or
    (3) Any amounts or funds that could be owed by the exporter to CCC 
in accordance with subparagraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section for 
unfulfilled obligations under the Agreement if the performance security 
should expire prior to the exporter's fulfillment of these obligations. 
Should the exporter fulfill these obligations, in accordance with the 
Agreement, after CCC has drawn upon the performance security, CCC will 
return the funds drawn to the exporter or other appropriate party, as 
determined by CCC. CCC may return the performance security if it 
determines that the exporter is not liable for any damages incurred by 
CCC as a result of the exporter's failure to fulfill its obligations 
under the Agreement and that the exporter will not retain any bonus 
payment which was not earned.
    (f) Cancellation or reduction of performance security. (1) CCC will 
agree, upon request by the exporter, to a cancellation of the 
performance security established for an Agreement when CCC determines, 
on the basis of evidence provided by the exporter or other evidence 
available to CCC, that:
    (i) The exporter has fully performed under the Agreement;
    (ii) The exporter has fully compensated CCC for all costs incurred 
or damages suffered by CCC, unless CCC has determined to hold the 
exporter harmless for such damages pursuant to Sec. 1494.801(d) as a 
result of the exporter's nonperformance of the Agreement; or
    (iii) It is no longer in the best interest of the EEP to require the 
exporter to maintain the performance security,

[[Page 631]]

and the exporter submits to CCC a written statement agreeing that all 
other terms and conditions of the Agreement will remain unchanged 
pending final resolution of the exporter's liabilities to CCC.
    (2) To support a request for the cancellation of performance 
security furnished in connection with an Agreement, the exporter must 
provide to CCC evidence of the export of the eligible commodity as 
provided by Sec. 1494.701(c), and the entry of the eligible commodity 
into the eligible country or countries. The entry certification must be 
in English or accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable 
to CCC. To show entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible 
country, the exporter must furnish to CCC an original certification 
signed by a duly authorized customs or port official of the eligible 
country, by the eligible buyer, by an agent or representative of the 
vessel or shipline which delivered the eligible commodity to the 
eligible country, or by a private surveyor in the target country or 
other documentation deemed acceptable by the GSM showing:
    (i) That the eligible commodity entered the eligible country;
    (ii) The identification of the export carrier;
    (iii) The quantity of the eligible commodity unloaded;
    (iv) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the eligible commodity; 
and
    (v) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the eligible commodity 
in the eligible country.
    (3) If the exporter makes multiple shipments against a sales 
contract with an eligible buyer, CCC may agree to a proportional 
reduction in the amount of the required performance security when the 
exporter has furnished evidence that the exporter has performed under 
the Agreement with respect to a particular shipment.
    (4) Upon the payment of liquidated damages by an exporter to CCC 
under a specific Agreement or the determination by CCC, pursuant to 
Sec. 1494.801(d), to hold the exporter harmless for the payment of 
liquidated damages owed to CCC under a specific Agreement, CCC will 
allow the exporter to cancel or reassign that portion of the performance 
security opened for such specific Agreement that would relate to the 
value of the liquidated damages.

Sec. 1494.501  Submission of offers to CCC.

    (a) Consideration of offers. Unless otherwise specified in the 
Invitation, CCC will consider offers on a daily basis from the date of 
issuance of the Invitation until such time that CCC announces that 
offers will no longer be accepted under the Invitation, the total 
quantity of the eligible commodity announced in the Invitation has been 
awarded, or the Invitation has expired as indicated by the expiration 
date shown in the Invitation.
    (1) Prior to the submission of an offer to CCC, the eligible 
exporter must have entered into a sales contract, as defined in 
Sec. 1494.201(bb), with an eligible buyer for the export sale and the 
delivery of the eligible commodity to the eligible country.

an eligible buyer must be after the issuance date of the applicable 
Invitation.
    (3) The sales contract between the eligible exporter and an eligible 
buyer may be conditioned upon the eligible exporter's entering into an 
Agreement with CCC under the EEP for the payment of a bonus.
    (4) CCC will not be responsible to any person for any loss caused by 
the failure of the eligible exporter to obtain a CCC bonus.
    (5) The eligible exporter must promptly notify CCC in writing of any 
amendment to the sales contract with an eligible buyer.
    (b) Submission of offers. Eligible exporters must submit offers, or 
modifications or withdrawals thereof, to the address, telephone, telex

EEP. Telephonic offers must be confirmed in writing immediately 
thereafter by telex or facsimile. If a telephonic offer is not confirmed

considered. The date and time affixed to submissions will be as 
determined by CCC.
    (c) Content of offers. Offers to CCC for a CCC bonus under the EEP 
must contain the information shown below in

[[Page 632]]

the same numerical order as shown below. CCC reserves the right to

consideration. The time shall be stated as ``after 3 p.m.'' For example,

bonus. In offers submitted in response to an Invitation in which CCC has 
announced the bonus amount, the eligible exporter shall state the dollar 
and cents amount of the Announced CCC Bonus.
    (7) The quantity, on a net weight basis, (less any dockage, if 
applicable) of the eligible commodity for which the eligible exporter 
wishes to receive a CCC bonus pursuant to an EEP Agreement. This 
quantity shall be exclusive of tolerances and expressed in the unit of 
measure specified in the applicable Invitation. This quantity may be 
less than the sales contract quantity.
    (8) The U.S. coast of export. The Invitation may require the 
eligible exporter to indicate: The coasts of export if more than one 
coast of export is allowed for an offer; the Canadian port if the 
eligible commodity is to be transshipped through a Canadian port on the 
St. Lawrence River; or the U.S. city and state from which the shipments

required by the applicable Invitation, the discharge port. The possible 
credit payment terms referenced in an offer are for CCC's information 
only and are not to be construed as a contingency for consideration or 
acceptance. The eligible exporter is fully responsible for the 
arrangement of such payment terms independently from the

[[Page 633]]

EEP offer and CCC bears no responsibility if such credit payment terms 
cannot be secured.
    (16) The delivery period specified in the sales contract expressed

    (d) Conditional offers. Any qualification or condition in, or added 
to, the offer and not expressly authorized by this subpart or the

<R05>
Sec. 1494.601  Acceptance of offers by CCC.

    (a) Establishment of acceptable sales prices and CCC bonuses. For 
each Invitation, CCC will establish sales prices for the eligible 
commodity and CCC bonus amounts which would be acceptable to CCC in 
terms of furthering the objectives of the EEP.
    (1) In establishing acceptable sales prices for the eligible 
commodity, CCC will consider available relevant market data.
    (2) In determining acceptable CCC bonus amounts, CCC may take into 
consideration factors such as, but not limited to, the following: The 
prevailing domestic market price of the eligible commodity; the price of 
the same agricultural commodity exported by other exporting countries to 
the eligible country; ocean freight rates for the export of the eligible 
commodity from the U.S. and other exporting countries to the eligible 
country; the particular preferences or purchasing practices of buyers in 
the eligible country which would customarily affect the acceptability of 
the eligible commodity relative to that of competing exports of the same 
agricultural commodity to the eligible country from other exporting 
countries; and the cost effectiveness of the payment of a CCC bonus 
amount in view of CCC's obligation to maximize the use of resources 
available for the operation of the EEP.
    (3) The acceptable sales prices and bonus amounts will be modified 
by CCC as necessary to take advantage of updated information that 
becomes available to CCC.
    (b) Acceptance of offers for a CCC bonus on a competitive basis. An 
offer from an eligible exporter for a CCC bonus on a competitive bonus 
that meets all of the requirements of this subpart will first be 
reviewed to determine if the offer contains an acceptable sales price. 
If the sales price contained in the offer is found to be acceptable, 
then the CCC bonus contained in the offer will be reviewed to determine 
if the CCC bonus requested is found to be acceptable. Offers with 
acceptable sales prices and acceptable CCC bonuses will be accepted 
under each Invitation beginning with the offer having the lowest CCC 
bonus amount, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (f) and (h) of 
this section.
    (c) Acceptance of offers for an announced CCC bonus. Offers from 
eligible exporters for an Announced CCC Bonus

[[Page 635]]

that meet all of the requirements of this subpart and which contain an 
acceptable sales price will be accepted under each Invitation on a 
first-come, first-served basis according to the time of receipt of the 
offer, as determined by CCC, subject to the limitations in paragraphs 
(f) and (h) of this section.
    (d) Notification of acceptance of offers. CCC will notify an 
eligible exporter by telephone of the acceptance or rejection of its 
offer as soon as possible after review of the exporter's offer by CCC 
but not later than 10 a.m. of the next business day after the date the 
offer was submitted for consideration. If an offer is rejected, CCC will 
notify the eligible exporter of the basis for the rejection. Acceptance 
of offers will be confirmed in writing. The date of the telephonic 
notification of acceptance by CCC of the eligible exporter's offer will 
be the effective date of the exporter's Agreement with CCC.
    (e) Announcement of acceptance of offers. CCC will generally 
announce the acceptance of offers by public press release as soon as 
possible after the notification to the exporter. The announcement will 
generally include the eligible commodity, the eligible country, the 
exporter, the delivery period, the CCC bonus, and, if applicable, the 
class of the eligible commodity.
    (f) Limitation on acceptance of offers. The total quantity of the 
eligible commodity, exclusive of tolerances, to be exported under all 
offers that are accepted by CCC pursuant to a particular Invitation will 
not be greater than the total quantity of the eligible commodity stated 
in such Invitation. CCC may refuse to accept further offers under an 
applicable Invitation if the quantity of the eligible commodity, 
exclusive of tolerances, already accepted totals the quantity, exclusive 
of tolerances, that is being tendered for by the eligible buyer, even 
though such quantity may be less than the total quantity available under 
that Invitation.
    (g) Rejection of offers. Any offer or part of an offer submitted for 
consideration that is not accepted by CCC by 10 a.m. of the next 
business day after the date for which the offer was submitted for 
consideration will be deemed to have been rejected.
    (h) CCC's right of rejection. Notwithstanding any other provisions 
of this subpart, CCC reserves the right to reject any or all offers 
submitted for consideration on a particular day, including those offers 
that have acceptable sales prices and CCC bonus amounts.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.701  Payment of bonus.

    (a) Forms of bonus. The bonus may be paid to the exporter in CCC 
Certificates or in any other form specified in the applicable Invitation 
which CCC determines to be appropriate.
    (b) Quantity on which bonus is paid. The quantity of the eligible 
commodity exported from the U.S. which is eligible for the payment of a 
CCC bonus is the net weight (less any dockage, if applicable) or count 
which is established by the Official Inspection Certificate, the 
Official Weight Certificate or the export bill of lading, whichever is 
less. If the exporter has furnished performance security under ``Option 
A'' of the applicable Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid prior 
to the entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible country, this 
quantity will be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of 
making payment to the exporter. If the exporter is not paid the bonus 
until the commodity enters into the eligible country, then this quantity 
will also be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of 
making payment to the exporter, unless in the determination of CCC, 
there is evidence to suggest that there was destruction, diversion or 
loss of the eligible commodity prior to entry into the eligible country. 
The payment of a bonus value to an exporter does not indicate that the 
bonus has been earned by the exporter under the Agreement; pursuant to 
Sec. 1494.801(a)(3), the bonus is not earned by the exporter until the 
eligible commodity enters into the eligible country in accordance with 
the Agreement and the exporter submits proof of such entry to CCC.
    (c) Request for bonus payment under ``Option A.'' If the exporter 
has furnished performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable 
Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid after export of the eligible 
commodity, the exporter must, within 30 calendar days after the date of 
export of the eligible

[[Page 636]]

commodity, furnish to the Director, at the address referenced in the 
Notice to Exporters--Contacts for EEP, a written request for payment of 
the bonus. All documents submitted to support such a request must be 
acceptable to the Director.
    (1) To support each bonus payment request, the exporter must furnish 
to the Director the following:
    (i) The original or an original copy of the on-board bill of lading 
issued for the export carrier and signed by an agent of the export 
carrier. The bill of lading must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity;
    (D) An on-board date; and
    (E) That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible 
country.
    (ii) The original or an original copy of the Official Weight 
Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate 
must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time 
of issuance;
    (B) The date and place of issuance; and
    (C) The weight or count of the eligible commodity.
    (iii) The original or an original copy of the Official Inspection 
Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate 
must show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time 
of issuance;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity to which the certificate 
relates; and
    (D) The quality description of the eligible commodity.
    (iv) If the documents submitted under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section do not specify the export carrier, the exporter 
must also submit a signed certification that the commodity represented 
by the Official Inspection and/or the Official Weight certificates is 
the identical eligible commodity represented on the export bill of 
lading.
    (2) If the export of the eligible commodity was by lash barge, the 
exporter must furnish, in addition to the documents required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a statement from the vessel's agent 
showing that the lash barge was loaded to the lash vessel named in the 
on-board lash bill of lading and that the eligible commodity is destined 
for the eligible country.
    (3) If the export of the eligible commodity was from a Canadian 
transshipment port on the St. Lawrence River, the exporter must furnish 
to the Director the following, in addition to the documents required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
    (i) Documentary evidence covering the movement of the eligible 
commodity from the United States to the export carrier described in the 
on-board bill of lading issued at the Canadian transshipment port and 
showing the information provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and, if 
applicable, (c)(2) of this section; and
    (ii) A certification that the eligible commodity exported is the 
identical eligible commodity that was shipped from the United States.
    (4) If the export of the eligible commodity was by railcar or truck, 
the exporter must furnish to the Director the following, in addition to 
the documents required by paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section:
    (i) The authenticated landing certificate or similar document issued 
by the government of the eligible country; and
    (ii) The original or an original copy of the bill of lading issued 
at the point of loading the railcar or truck. The bill of lading must 
show:
    (A) The identification of the export carrier;
    (B) The date and place of issuance;
    (C) The quantity of the eligible commodity;
    (D) The date that the railcar or truck was loaded; and
    (E) That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible 
country.
    (d) Request for bonus payment under ``Option B.'' If the exporter 
has furnished performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable 
Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid after the entry of the 
exported eligible commodity into the eligible country, the exporter 
must, within 60 calendar days

[[Page 637]]

after the date of entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible 
country, furnish to the Director at the address referenced in the Notice 
to Exporters--Contracts for EEP, a written request for payment of the 
bonus. To support each request, the exporter must furnish to the 
Director, in a form acceptable to the Director, the documents specified 
in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable, along with the 
certification of entry specified in Sec. 1494.401(f)(2).
    (e) Time frame for payment of a bonus. CCC will endeavor to pay the 
bonus to the exporter within 10 business days after CCC determines that 
the documents supporting the bonus request are acceptable.
    (f) Certificate amount. If CCC decides to pay the bonus in the form 
of a CCC Certificate(s), the dollar value of the certificate(s) issued 
to the exporter will be determined by multiplying the CCC bonus 
specified in the Agreement by the net quantity of the eligible commodity 
on which the bonus is to be paid, as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, less any dockage if applicable.
    (g) Late requests for bonus payment. If CCC decides to pay the bonus 
in the form of a CCC Certificate(s) and the exporter fails to request 
issuance of the certificate(s) within 30 calendar days after the date of 
export of the eligible commodity, if the exporter has chosen performance 
security ``Option A,'' or within 60 days after the entry of the eligible 
commodity into the eligible country, if the exporter has chosen 
performance security ``Option B'', CCC may, upon issuing the 
certificate(s), discount the certificate(s) in an amount determined 
appropriate by CCC to compensate it for costs which may be incurred by 
CCC as a result of the exporter's delay.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.801  Enforcement and termination of agreements with CCC.

    (a) Performance in accordance with an Agreement with CCC. (1) An 
exporter which enters into an Agreement with CCC must ensure that the 
eligible commodity is exported from the U.S. and enters the eligible 
country in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
    (2) The diversion of the eligible commodity to a country other than 
the eligible country is prohibited. Transshipments of the eligible 
commodity are permitted only if specifically allowed in the applicable 
Invitation or for shipment through a Canadian transshipment port on the 
St. Lawrence River if the eligible commodity had been shipped from the 
United States via the Great Lakes coastal range and its identity had 
been preserved until shipped from Canada.
    (3) Regardless of whether or not a bonus has been paid by CCC to the 
exporter pursuant to Sec. 1494.701, the bonus is not earned by the 
exporter until the eligible commodity enters into the eligible country 
in accordance with the Agreement. In order to retain a bonus or request 
payment of a bonus, depending upon the option chosen for furnishing 
performance security, and to request cancellation of the performance 
security, the exporter must provide evidence to CCC, as specified in 
Sec. 1494.401(f)(2), that the eligible commodity entered into the 
eligible country. If, on the basis of evidence available to it, CCC 
determines that there was destruction, diversion or loss of the eligible 
commodity prior to entry into the eligible country, CCC will not release 
the amount of performance security corresponding to the amount of 
eligible commodity for which insufficient evidence of entry into the 
eligible country was presented to CCC until:
    (i) CCC recovers from the exporter the amount of the bonus 
corresponding to such amount of the eligible commodity, if the exporter 
has already been paid the bonus under performance security ``Option A''; 
and
    (ii) The requirements of either Sec. 1494.401(f)(1)(ii) or 
Sec. 1494.401(f)(1)(iii) have been met.
    (4) The failure of an exporter to perform in full and to fulfill all 
of its obligations under the Agreement will constitute a breach of the 
Agreement. An exporter which breaches the Agreement may be required to 
forfeit its right to receive or retain part or all of the bonus 
authorized or paid under the Agreement and may also be liable to CCC for 
damages. Examples of an exporter's failure to perform under the

[[Page 638]]

Agreement include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) The exporter does not ship all of the required amount of the 
eligible commodity in accordance with the delivery period stated in the 
Agreement;
    (ii) The exporter exports an amount of the eligible commodity that 
is inconsistent with the quality specifications in the Agreement;
    (iii) The exporter is unable to provide a certification that all of 
the eligible commodity exported pursuant to the Agreement was entered 
into the eligible country;
    (iv) The eligible commodity is transshipped through any country, 
other than Canada, unless specifically allowed in the applicable 
Invitation; or
    (v) The eligible commodity is transshipped through Canada without 
having its identity preserved.
    (5) If the eligible commodity is to be delivered to the eligible 
buyer in multiple shipments, CCC may decide to consider the shipments 
separately in determining whether the exporter has failed to perform 
under the Agreement.
    (b) Return of bonus. An exporter that fails to fulfill all of its 
obligations under the Agreement shall be in default. If an exporter that 
has already been paid the bonus value defaults, CCC shall have the right 
to recover the bonus value paid for the quantity of the eligible 
commodity with respect to which the exporter failed to perform under the 
Agreement.
    (1) If CCC has paid this bonus value in the form of a CCC 
Certificate(s), the exporter shall pay to CCC the higher of:
    (i) The dollar value of the CCC Certificate(s);
    (ii) The dollar amount received for the CCC Certificate(s) if the 
CCC Certificate(s) was transferred to another party; or
    (iii) The dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of the CCC-
owned commodities exchanged for the CCC Certificate(s) if the 
commodities were sold to another party.
    (2) If CCC has paid this bonus value in some other form, as 
specified in the applicable Invitation, the exporter shall pay to CCC 
the dollar and cents amount or equivalent of the bonus value paid to the 
exporter.
    (c) Liability for liquidated damages. The exporter's failure to 
perform under the Agreement will cause serious and substantial losses to 
CCC, such as damages to the EEP and CCC's domestic price support 
program, storage charges, and administrative and other costs incurred. 
If the exporter breaches the Agreement, the exporter will be liable to 
pay to CCC as liquidated damages an amount obtained by applying the 
method or rate for determining damages specified in the applicable 
Invitation to the quantity of the eligible commodity with respect to 
which the exporter failed to perform under such Agreement. In submitting 
an offer in response to an Invitation issued under this subpart, the 
exporter agrees that such liquidated damages are reasonable estimates of 
the probable actual damages which may be incurred by CCC.
    (d) Decision to hold the exporter harmless for liquidated damages. 
CCC will hold an exporter harmless for the payment of liquidated damages 
if:
    (1) The exporter's failure to perform under the Agreement was due to 
causes solely without the exporter's fault or negligence and the 
exporter had taken the necessary action to enable it to export the 
required quantity of the eligible commodity and enter it into the 
eligible country; or
    (2) The eligible commodity was lost or destroyed after it had been 
placed aboard the export carrier.

In making the decision whether to hold an exporter harmless pursuant to 
this paragraph, CCC may consider any information available to CCC, 
including any information provided to it by the exporter.
    (e) Fraud, scheme or device. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, CCC may take action to recover any bonus paid or to hold the 
exporter liable for the payment of damages caused to CCC if the exporter 
engages in fraud with respect to the EEP, or adopts or participates in 
adopting a scheme or device which is designed to evade this subpart or 
which has the effect of evading this subpart. Such acts shall include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Concealing information which is required by this subpart; or

[[Page 639]]

    (2) Submitting information which is known by the exporter to be 
false or erroneous.
    (f) CCC's right to recover amounts due CCC by exporters. If the 
exporter breaches its obligations under the Agreement and becomes liable 
to CCC for repayment of the bonus value or for liquidated or other 
damages, CCC reserves the right to recover such amounts due CCC by 
making a claim against the performance security furnished to CCC, as 
described under Sec. 1494.401, or by taking any other measures available 
to CCC as a result of this subpart or any laws or regulations, including 
debt settlement regulations, applicable to CCC.
    (g) Shipping tolerances. If the exporter exports and enters into the 
eligible country, in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement, 
a quantity of the eligible commodity which is less than the quantity 
specified in Sec. 1494.501(c)(7) but not less than such quantity minus 5 
percent, the exporter shall not be required to pay liquidated damages 
for failure to perform under the Agreement for the quantity which failed 
to be exported and entered into the eligible country. If an exporter 
exports and enters into the eligible country, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Agreement, a quantity of the eligible commodity 
which is greater than the quantity specified in Sec. 1494.501(c)(7), the 
exporter may request payment of the bonus value based upon the actual 
quantity, on a net weight basis, exported and entered into the eligible 
country, but not greater than the quantity specified in 
Sec. 1494.501(c)(7), plus 5 percent.
    (h) Termination of agreements. (1) CCC may, by written notice to the 
exporter, terminate an Agreement, in whole or in part, as a result of:
    (i) the failure of the exporter to carry out any provisions of the 
Agreement;
    (ii) the failure of the exporter to maintain a business office in 
the U.S.;
    (iii) the failure of the exporter to maintain an agent in the U.S. 
for service of process; or
    (iv) the suspension or debarment of the exporter from participation 
in CCC or other U.S. Government programs.

If an Agreement is terminated by CCC pursuant to this subparagraph, CCC 
will not compensate the exporter for any costs incurred by the exporter. 
The exporter will be liable to CCC for any funds owed to CCC for the 
repayment of any bonus already paid and may be liable to CCC for 
liquidated or other damages suffered by CCC. If CCC intends to hold the 
exporter liable for liquidated damages, and it has not already so 
notified the exporter prior to the termination of the Agreement, CCC 
will generally do so at the time that it notifies the exporter of the 
termination of the Agreement.
    (2) CCC may, by written notice to the exporter, terminate an 
Agreement, in whole or in part, if CCC determines it to be in the best 
interest of CCC. If an agreement is so terminated, the exporter will be 
compensated for reasonable losses, as determined by CCC, resulting from 
such termination. These losses will not include lost profits and will 
not exceed the bonus value under the Agreement.
    (i) Amendment of agreements. (1) CCC will have the authority to 
amend an Agreement, either before or after such Agreement has been 
breached by the exporter, if the exporter requests that the Agreement be 
amended and CCC determines that such amendment would serve the best 
interests of the EEP. The exporter may be required to submit documentary 
evidence to CCC to demonstrate that it is making progress toward 
fulfilling the Agreement before CCC will consider amending the 
Agreement. All requests for amendments submitted by exporters, and all 
amendments made by CCC to an Agreement, under this subpart shall be in 
writing.
    (2) Prior to amending an Agreement with the exporter, CCC will 
consider whether the amendment to the Agreement should include a 
reduction in the CCC bonus or a modification of the sales price. If CCC 
determines that the CCC bonus and the sales price are still acceptable, 
it may amend the Agreement to incorporate the exporter's requested 
change, while maintaining the current CCC bonus and sales price, 
provided that the amendment would otherwise serve the best interests of 
the EEP. If CCC determines that the CCC bonus and/or the sales price are 
no longer acceptable, due to changes in market or other conditions, it 
will so

[[Page 640]]

inform the exporter. If the exporter still requests that the Agreement 
be amended, CCC and the exporter will enter into discussions in an 
attempt to arrive at a new CCC bonus and/or sales price which would be 
acceptable to CCC. If these discussions are successful, then CCC may 
amend the Agreement to incorporate the exporter's requested change as 
well as the new CCC bonus and/or sales price, provided that the 
amendment would otherwise serve the best interests of the EEP. If these 
discussions are unsuccessful, then the Agreement will not be amended and 
the exporter will be considered to be in breach of the Agreement if it 
fails to perform under the terms of the Agreement.
    (j) Amendments to sales contracts. In the event of an amendment to 
the sales contract between the exporter and the eligible buyer or a 
change in the delivery schedule, CCC will determine whether the 
amendment or change would constitute a breach of the Agreement. If CCC 
determines that the amendment or change would constitute a breach of the 
Agreement, CCC may terminate the Agreement. In the alternative, if CCC 
determines that a continuation of the Agreement would serve the best 
interests of the EEP, and if the exporter requests an amendment, CCC may 
amend the Agreement to take into account the amendment to the sales 
contract or change in delivery schedule. An amendment to an Agreement 
will be in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section. CCC will 
promptly advise the exporter of its determination in writing by letter, 
facsimile, or telex.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.901  Dispute resolution and appeals.

    (a) Dispute resolution. (1) The Director of the CCC Operations 
Division (Director, CCCOD) and the exporter will attempt to resolve any 
disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising 
under the EEP, this subpart, the applicable Invitation, or the 
Agreement.
    (2) The exporter may seek reconsideration of a determination by the 
Director, CCCOD relating to the Agreement by submitting a letter 
requesting reconsideration to the Director, CCCOD, within 30 days of the 
date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the date of 
a determination will be the date of the letter or other means of 
notification to the exporter of the determination. The exporter may 
include with the letter requesting reconsideration any additional 
information which it wishes the Director, CCCOD, to consider in 
reviewing its request. The Director, CCCOD, will respond to the request 
for reconsideration within 30 days of the date on which the request or 
the final documentary evidence submitted by the exporter is received by 
him, whichever is later, unless the GSM extends the time permitted for 
response. If the exporter fails to request reconsideration of a 
determination by the Director, CCCOD, that the exporter owes any funds 
to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds will become a debt of the 
exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-day period for submitting 
such a request.
    (3) If the exporter requested a reconsideration of a determination 
by the Director, CCCOD, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, 
and the Director, CCCOD, upheld the original determination, then the 
exporter may appeal the determination to the GSM in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the exporter 
fails to appeal the determination to the GSM, then any funds owed to CCC 
will become a debt of the exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-
day period for submitting an appeal to the GSM.
    (b) Appeal procedures. (1) An exporter which has exhausted the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the 
GSM a determination of the Director, CCCOD, relating to the Agreement 
between the exporter and CCC. An appeal to the GSM must be in writing 
and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 days following the 
date of the final determination by the Director, CCCOD. In this appeal 
to the GSM, the exporter shall be entitled to an administrative hearing 
before the GSM, if the exporter indicates in its appeal letter that it 
desires such a hearing.
    (2) If the exporter does not desire an administrative hearing, the 
exporter

[[Page 641]]

may submit any additional written information or documentation which it 
desires the GSM to consider in acting upon its appeal. This information 
or documentation may be submitted to the GSM up until the time that a 
decision is made by the GSM. The GSM will base the determination upon 
information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will 
endeavor to make a decision on an appeal not involving a hearing within 
60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the appeal or the date 
that final documentary evidence is submitted by the exporter to the GSM, 
whichever is later.
    (3) If the exporter has indicated that it desires an administrative 
hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing which is 
mutually convenient for the GSM and the exporter. This date will 
ordinarily be within 60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the 
request for hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure. The 
exporter and/or its counsel may present any administrative or 
documentary evidence to the GSM which it desires to have the GSM 
consider in making a determination. A transcript of the hearing will not 
ordinarily be prepared unless the exporter bears the costs involved in 
preparing the transcript, although the GSM may arrange to have a 
transcript prepared at the expense of the Government if it is determined 
to be appropriate. The exporter may provide additional written 
information to the GSM up until the time that the GSM makes a 
determination. The GSM will base the determination upon the information 
contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to make a 
decision within 60 days of the date of the hearing or the date of 
receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared, whichever is later.
    (4) The decision of the GSM will be the final determination of CCC 
and the exporter will be entitled to no further administrative appellate 
rights.
    (5) If the GSM upholds a determination of the Director, CCCOD, that 
the exporter owes any funds to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds 
will become a debt of the exporter to CCC.
    (c) Failure to comply with determination. If, for any reason, the 
exporter has failed to pay funds to CCC which have been determined to be 
owed to CCC under the Agreement and the exporter has exhausted its 
rights under this section or has failed to exercise such rights, then 
CCC will have the right to withdraw funds from the performance security 
established by the exporter or to take any other measures available to 
CCC as result of this subpart or any laws or regulations, including debt 
settlement regulations, applicable to CCC.
    (d) Exporter's obligation to perform. The exporter will continue to 
have an obligation to perform under the Agreement pending the conclusion 
of all procedures under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1001  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Assignments. The exporter may not assign the Agreement or any 
rights thereunder, including the right to receive a bonus under the 
Agreement.
    (b) Maintenance of records and access to premises. (1) For a period 
of five years after CCC agrees to the cancellation of an exporter's 
performance security for an Agreement, the exporter must maintain 
accurate records showing sales and deliveries of the eligible commodity 
exported in connection with the Agreement. The Secretary of Agriculture 
and the Comptroller General of the United States, through their 
authorized representatives, will have full and complete access to the 
premises of the exporter during regular business hours from the 
effective date of the Agreement until the expiration of such five-year 
period to inspect, examine, audit and make copies of the exporter's 
books, records and accounts concerning transactions relating to the 
Agreement, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts 
pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and 
incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen. From the effective date of 
the Agreement and until the expiration of such five-year period, the 
exporter may be required to make available to the Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through 
their authorized representatives, records that pertain to transactions 
conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such 
records would pertain directly to the review of transactions

[[Page 642]]

undertaken by the exporter in connection with the performance of an EEP 
Agreement.
    (2) The exporter must maintain the certification of entry specified 
in Sec. 1494.401(f)(2), and must provide access to such document if 
requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or an authorized 
representative, for the five-year period specified in subparagraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Arrival verification reviews. CCC will review, on an annual 
basis, a sufficient number of exports made in connection with EEP 
Agreements to ensure that the eligible commodity which was exported 
pursuant to each such Agreement arrived in the eligible country 
specified in the Agreement.
    (d) Signatory on certifications. Any certification required from a 
person pursuant to this subpart or an Invitation must be signed by the 
person, if an individual, or by a partner or officer of the person, if 
the person is a partnership or a corporation, respectively.
    (e) Officials not to benefit. No member of or Delegate to Congress, 
or Resident Commissioner, will participate or share in any of the 
benefits of any Agreement entered into pursuant to the EEP, but this 
provision may not be construed to extend to an Agreement made by CCC 
with a corporation for its general benefit.
    (f) Paperwork Reduction Act. The information collection requirements 
contained in this subpart have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 
35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0551-0028.
    (g) Waiver of irregularities. CCC reserves the right to waive any 
informality or minor irregularity with respect to any aspect of the 
operation of the EEP or any Agreement executed thereunder in order to 
best accomplish the purposes of the program.

<R05>
Sec. 1494.1100  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) Dairy Export Incentive Program 
(DEIP). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered together 
in order to select eligible commodities and eligible countries for DEIP 
initiatives which will best meet the program's objectives. The 
objectives of the program are to increase U.S. agricultural commodity 
exports and to encourage other countries exporting agricultural 
commodities to undertake serious negotiations on agricultural trade 
problems. Under the DEIP, bonuses are made available by CCC to enable 
exporters to meet prevailing world prices for targeted dairy products in 
targeted destinations. In the operation of the DEIP, CCC will make 
reasonable efforts to avoid the displacement of commercial export sales 
of U.S. dairy products and to ensure that sales facilitated by the DEIP 
are in addition to, and not in place of, any export sales of dairy 
products that the exporter would have otherwise made in the absence of 
the program.


<R05>
Sec. 1494.1101  Criteria.

    The criteria considered in evaluating and approving proposals for 
the DEIP are those set forth in Sec. 1494.20 of this part.

Sec. 1494.1200  Program operations.

    This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the 
Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC). Under the DEIP, CCC facilitates the export of U.S. 
dairy products by paying bonuses to exporters which export U.S. dairy 
products to targeted markets in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of an Agreement entered into between the exporter and

[[Page 643]]

CCC. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the program 
operations provisions of subpart B of this part, relating to the Export 
Enhancement Program, will also apply to the DEIP. Any terms or 
conditions applicable to a particular Invitation for Offers (Invitation) 
under the DEIP, beyond those terms or conditions set forth in this 
subpart or subpart B of this part, will be specifically provided for in 
such Invitation.


<R05>

Sec. 1496.2  Administration.

    (a) The program will be carried out by the Farm Service Agency 
(referred to in this subpart as ``FSA'') under the general supervision 
and direction of the Executive Vice President of CCC. The program will 
be administered through the Office of the Deputy Administrator, 
Commodity Operations, FSA, Washington, DC and the Kansas City Commodity 
Office (KCCO), FSA, Kansas City, Missouri. Procurement will be in 
accordance with USDA-1, ``General Terms and Conditions for the 
Procurement of Agricultural Commodities or Services'', as amended or 
revised, applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
(48 CFR), and applicable purchase announcements and bid invitations.
    (b) Purchases are made to fulfill commodity requests received in

    As used in the regulations in this subpart and in the forms and 
documents related thereto, the following terms shall have the meaning 
assigned to them in this section.
    (a) AID means the Agency for International Development, an agency 
within the United States Department of State.
    (b) FSA means the Farm Service Agency, an agency within the United 
States Department of Agriculture.
    (c) DACO means the Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, FSA.
    (d) CCC means Commodity Credit Corporation, a corporate agency 
within the United States Department of Agriculture.
    (e) Commodity Office means the Kansas City Commodity Office, within 
FSA, which is responsible for assigned inventory management, 
acquisition, disposition and related program activities of CCC.
    (f) Lowest landed cost means the lowest combined total cost of the 
commodity plus transportation charges to the port of discharge.

[44 FR 27407, May 10, 1979, as amended at 52 FR 5728, Feb. 25, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1496.4  Issuance of invitations.

    From time to time, CCC will issue invitations to purchase or process 
agricultural products for utilization in the Title II, Pub. L. 480 
program. The invitations will specify the contract terms;

[[Page 644]]

the closing date for acceptance of bids; the date contracts will be 
awarded; and other pertinent information. Invitations will be issued at 
least 10 days prior to the deadline for submission of bids. The bid 
submission deadlines and contract awards will be timed so not more than 
one market day elapses between bid opening (bid submission deadline) and 
contract awards.


<R05>
Sec. 1496.5  Consideration of bids.

    (a) Lowest landed cost. The general principle of awarding contracts 
that will result in the lowest landed cost will prevail. Lowest landed 
cost will be calculated on the basis of U.S. flag rates and service for 
that portion of the commodities being purchased that CCC determines is 
necessary and practicable to meet cargo preference requirements and on 
an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the remaining portion of 
the commodities being purchased. However, the additional factors set 
forth in this section will be considered in awarding contracts.
    (b)(1) Availability of ocean service. Prior to receipt of offers 
from commodity suppliers, CCC will review ocean freight information from 
available sources including, but not limited to, trade journal 
newspapers, port publications, and steamship publications to determine 
the availability of appropriate ocean service.
    (2) Additional information will be gathered, if necessary by direct 
contact with the steamship company involved, regarding such factors as 
the minimum tonnage and/or revenue required to perform the service 
needed.
    (3) Special emphasis will be placed on assuring that under normal 
conditions the vessels will be calling at U.S. ports to coordinate 
loading with cargo arrival from suppliers.
    (4) Freight rates will be obtained from published ocean tariffs to 
make cost comparisons between various steamship companies and coastal 
ranges.
    (5) Available service will be analyzed to ensure that the port or 
coastal range selected for exportation has available ocean 
transportation service that will provide maximum compliance with the 
stated policy of AID with regard to the utilization of U.S. and other 
flag vessels to carry commodities shipped under Title II, Pub. L. 480.
    (c) Adequacy of service. (1) Prior to the selection of a coastal 
range or U.S. port from which commodities will be shipped, the ocean 
transportation service available may be examined to determine adequacy 
of service. The data utilized may include, but not necessarily be 
limited to, the past performance of a particular vessel or steamship 
line in terms of loss and/or damage to cargo when received at 
destination port; past performance in meeting established delivery 
schedules, etc. CCC may eliminate from consideration ports or coastal 
ranges where ocean transportation service is considered inadequate by 
CCC. When clearly superior service is available at another port or 
coastal range it may be selected over other service.
    (d) Port performance. (1) Each port will be contacted prior to bid 
evaluation to determine their cargo handling capabilities for Title II, 
Pub. L. 480, commodities when it is reasonably expected that quantities 
of 1,000 tons or more may be shipped. Allocations to that port will be 
governed by the minimum or maximum quantities indicated.
    (2) Limits of quantities purchased for delivery to a port or coastal 
range may also be imposed by the amount of vessel space available during 
the expected delivery and loading period.
    (3) Prior to the final selection of a U.S. port from which 
commodities will be shipped, the adequacy of the port to receive, 
accumulate, warehouse, handle, store, and protect the cargo will be 
considered.
    (4) Factors which will be considered in this determination will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the adequacy of building 
structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, 
cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices.
    (5) When it is determined that the U.S. port is congested, 
facilities are overloaded, and a vessel would not be able to dock and 
load cargo without delay, or when labor disputes or lack of labor will 
prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely

[[Page 645]]

manner, another coastal range or port will be considered.
    (e) Transit time. CCC will consider total transit time, as it 
relates to a final delivery date, in order to satisfy program 
requirements.
    (f) Great Lakes ports. (1) Commodities offered for delivery ``free 
alongside ship'' (f.a.s.) Great Lakes port range or intermodal bridge-
port Great Lakes port range that represent the overall (foreign and U.S. 
flag) lowest landed cost will be awarded on that basis. Such offers will 
not be reevaluated on a lowest landed cost U.S.-flag basis unless CCC 
determines that 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of bagged, 
processed or fortified commodities furnished under Title II of Public 
Law 480 has been, or will be, transported from the Great Lakes port 
range during that fiscal year.
    (2) CCC will consider commodity offers as offers for delivery 
``intermodal bridge-port Great Lakes port range'' only if:
    (i) The offer specifies delivery at a marine cargo-handling facility 
that is capable of loading ocean going vessels at a Great Lakes port, as 
well as loading ocean going conveyances such as barges and container 
vans, and
    (ii) The commodities will be moved from one transportation 
conveyance to another at such a facility.

[44 FR 27407, May 10, 1979, as amended at 52 FR 5729, Feb. 25, 1987; 63 
FR 11104, Mar. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1496.6  Data to be used.

    (a) CCC will use all available historical and current data as a 
basis for procurement considerations, including evaluations and 
decisions regarding the physical facilities and performance of ports. 
Heavy reliance will be placed upon current port conditions as determined 
from first hand observations and reports from USDA and other reliable 
sources.
    (b) The primary source of historical data will be documents used in 
the normal course of conducting business. Sources include contract 
documents, ocean bills of lading, survey and/or outturn reports made by 
commercial cargo surveyors, claim settlement agreements, claim payment 
documents, etc. CCC will utilize only such data and make only those 
analyses that it believes will provide a valid measure of program 
performance.


<R05>
Sec. 1496.7  Final contract determinations.

    The KCCO shall be responsible for making lowest landed cost 
determinations. KCCO shall provide that information to an Ad Hoc 
Committee designated by the Administrator, FSA, to review the lowest 
landed cost determinations as a result of any or all of the factors 
referred to herein. If, after the committee makes its review and it is 
recommended that contracts should be awarded based on the additional 
factors which would override lowest landed cost determinations, these 
recommendations will be presented to the Contracting Officer for a final 
decision. These decisions will be fully documented and explained as to 
the reasons the lowest landed cost was not selected.

Sec. 1499.8  Ocean transportation.

    (a) Cargo preference. Shipments of commodities provided under either 
the section 416(b) or Food for Progress programs are subject to the 
requirements of sections 901(b) and 901b of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, regarding carriage on U.S.-flag vessels. CCC will endeavor to meet 
these requirements separately for each program for each 12-month 
compliance period. A Cooperating Sponsor shall comply with the 
instructions of CCC regarding the quantity of commodities that must be 
carried on U.S. flag vessels.
    (b) Freight procurement requirements. When CCC is financing any 
portion of the ocean freight, whether on U.S.-flag or non-U.S. flag 
vessels, and the Cooperating Sponsor arranges ocean transportation:
    (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange ocean transportation 
through competitive bidding and shall obtain approval of all invitations 
for bids from the offices specified in the Program Agreement prior to 
issuance.
    (2) Invitations for bids shall be issued through the Transportation 
News Ticker (TNT), New York, and at least one other comparable means of 
trade communication.
    (3) Freight invitations for bids shall include specified procedures

    (iii) If destination bagging or transportation to a point beyond the 
discharge port is required, the offer separately state the total rate 
and the portion thereof attributable to the ocean segment of the 
movement;
    (iv) Any non-liner U.S. flag vessel 15 years or older offer, in 
addition to any other offered rate, a one-way rate applicable in the 
event the vessel is scrapped or transferred to foreign flag registry 
prior to the end of the return voyage to the United States;
    (v) In the case of packaged commodities, U.S. flag carriers specify

or breakbulk transshipment and identify whether transshipment (including 
container relays) will be via U.S. or foreign flag vessel;
    (vi) Vessels offered subject to Maritime Administration approval 
will not be accepted; and
    (vii) Offers be received by a specified closing time, which must be 
the same for both U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels.
    (4) In the case of shipments of bulk commodities and non-liner 
shipments of packaged commodities, the Cooperating Sponsor shall open 
offers in public in the United States at the time and place specified in 
the invitation for bids and consider only offers that are responsive to 
the invitation for bids without negotiation. Late offers shall not be 
considered or accepted.
    (5) All responsive offers received for both U.S. flag and foreign 
flag service shall be presented to KCCO which will determine the extent 
to which U.S.-flag vessels will be used.
    (6) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish the Director, 
Public Law 480-OD, or other official specified in the Program Agreement, 
copies of all offers received with the time of receipt indicated 
thereon. The Director,

[[Page 650]]

Public Law 480-OD, or other official specified in the Program Agreement, 
will approve all vessel fixtures. The Cooperating Sponsor may fix 
vessels subject to the required approval; however, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall not confirm a vessel fixture until advised of the required 
approval and the results of the Maritime Administration's guideline rate 
review. The Cooperating Sponsor shall not request guideline rate advice 
from the Maritime Administration. The Cooperating Sponsor will, promptly 
after receipt of vessel approval, issue a public notice of the fixture 
details on the TNT or other means of communication approved by the 
Director, Public Law 480-OD.
    (7) Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers may not be employed to 
carry shipments on either U.S. or foreign-flag vessels.

    (2) The shipping agent so nominated shall submit the information and 
certifications required by 7 CFR 17.4 to the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) A person may not act as a shipping agent for a Cooperating 
Sponsor unless the Deputy Administrator has notified the Cooperating 
Sponsor in writing that the nomination is accepted.
    (d) Commissions. (1) When any portion of the ocean freight is paid 
by CCC, total commissions earned on U.S. and foreign flag bookings by 
all parties arranging vessel fixtures, shall not exceed 2\1/2\ percent 
of the total freight costs.
    (2) Address commissions are prohibited.
    (e) Contract terms. When CCC is paying any portion of the ocean 
freight, charter parties and liner booking contracts must conform to the 
following requirements, as applicable:
    (1) Packaged commodities on liner vessels shall be shipped on the 
basis of full berth terms with no demurrage or despatch;
    (2) Shipments of bulk liquid commodities may be contracted in 
accordance with trade custom. Other bulk commodities, including 
shipments that require bagging or stacking for the account of the 
vessel, shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load, free out, with 
demurrage and despatch applicable at load and discharge ports; except 
that, if bulk commodities require further inland distribution, they 
shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load with demurrage and despatch 
at load and berth terms discharge, i.e., no demurrage, despatch, or 
detention at discharge. Demurrage and despatch shall be settled between 
the ocean carrier and commodity suppliers at load port and between the 
ocean carrier and charterers at discharge ports. CCC is not responsible 
for resolving disputes involving the calculation of laytime or the 
payment of demurrage or despatch.
    (3) If the Program Agreement requires the Cooperating Sponsor to 
arrange an irrevocable letter of credit for ocean freight, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable for detention of the vessel for 
loading delays attributable solely to the decision of the ocean carrier 
not to commence loading because of the failure of the Cooperating 
Sponsor to establish such letter of credit. Charter parties and liner 
booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean 
carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention for 
all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, 
including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay 
shall not commence earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the 
designated loading port within the laydays specified in the charter 
party or liner booking contract, and upon notification of the vessel's 
readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the applicable charter 
party or liner booking contract. The period of such

[[Page 651]]

delay shall end at the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit 
have been established for ocean freight or the time the vessel begins 
loading, whichever is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not 
count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no 
later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.
    (4) Charges including, but not limited to charges for inspection, 
fumigation, and carrying charges, attributable to the failure of the 
vessel to present before the canceling date will be for the account of 
the ocean carrier.
    (5) Ocean freight is earned under a charter party when the vessel 
and cargo arrive at the first port of discharge, Provided, That if a 
force majeure prevents the vessel's arrival at the first port of 
discharge, 100% of the ocean freight is payable or, if the charter party 
provides for completing additional requirements after discharge such as 
bagging, stacking, or inland transportation, not more than 85% of the 
ocean freight is payable, at the time the General Sales Manager 
determines that such force majeure was the cause of nonarrival; and
    (6) When the ocean carrier offers delivery to destination ports on 
U.S.-flag vessels, but foreign-flag vessels are used for any part of the 
voyage to the destination port without first obtaining the approval of 
the Cooperating Sponsor, KCCO, and any other approval that may be 
required by the Program Agreement, the ocean freight rate will be 
reduced to the lowest responsive foreign-flag vessel rate offered in 
response to the same invitation for bids and the carrier agrees to pay 
CCC the difference between the contracted ocean freight rate and the 
freight rate offered by such foreign-flag vessel.
    (f) Coordination between CCC and the Cooperating Sponsor. When a 
Program Agreement specifies that the Cooperating Sponsor will arrange 
ocean transportation:
    (1) KCCO will furnish the Cooperating Sponsor, or its agent, with a 
Notice of Commodity Availability (Form CCC-512) which will specify the 
receiving country, commodity, quantity, and date at U.S. port or 
intermodal delivery point.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall complete the Form CCC-512 
indicating name of steamship company, vessel name, vessel flag and 
estimated time of arrival at U.S. port; and shall sign and return the 
completed form to KCCO, with a copy to the Director, P.L. 480-OD. If CCC 
agrees to pay any part of the ocean transportation for liner cargoes, 
the Cooperating Sponsor shall also indicate on the Form CCC-512 the 
applicable Federal Maritime Commission tariff rate, and tariff 
identification.
    (3) KCCO will issue instructions to have the commodity delivered 
f.a.s. or f.o.b. vessel, U.S. port of export or intermodal delivery 
point, consigned to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (g) Documents required for payment of freight--(1) General rule. To 
receive payment for ocean freight, the following documents shall be 
submitted to the Director, CCCPSD:

letterhead and signed by an official or agent of the requester, the name 
of the entity to receive payment, the bank ABA number to which payment 
is to be made; the account number for the deposit at the bank; the 
requester's taxpayer identification number; and the type of the account 
into which funds will be deposited.
    (2) In cases of force majeure. To receive payment in cases where the 
General Sales Manager determines that circumstances of force majeure 
have prevented the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge, the

with a recipient agency prior to the transfer of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income to the recipient agency. Copies of such 
agreements shall be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, 
and the Director, PDD. Such agreements shall require the recipient 
agency to pay the Cooperating Sponsor the value of any commodities, sale 
proceeds or program income that are used for purposes not expressly

agreement with the host government under which the commodities imported 
for a sale or barter may be imported, sold, or bartered without 
assessment of duties or taxes. In such cases and where the commodities 
are sold, they shall be sold at prices reflecting prevailing local 
market value.
    (c) The Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit all sale proceeds into an 
interest-bearing account unless prohibited by the laws or customs of the 
importing country or CCC determines that to do so would constitute an 
undue burden. Interest earned on such deposits shall only be used for 
approved activities.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the Cooperating 
Sponsor may use sale proceeds and resulting interest only for those 
purposes approved in the applicable Plan of Operation.
    (e) CCC will approve the use of sale proceeds and interest to 
purchase real and personal property where local law permits the 
Cooperating Sponsor to retain title to such property, but will not 
approve the use of sale proceeds or interest to pay for the acquisition, 
development, construction, alteration or upgrade of real property that 
is;
    (1) Owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged 
exclusively in religious activity, or
    (2) Used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes; except that, a 
Cooperating Sponsor may use such sale proceeds or interest to pay for 
repairs or rehabilitation of a structure located on such real property 
to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of provided 
commodities but only if such structure is not used in whole or in part 
for any religious or sectarian purposes while the provided commodities 
are stored in such structure. When not approved in the Plan of 
Operation, such use may be approved by the Agricultural Counsellor or 
Attache.
    (f) The Cooperating Sponsor shall follow commercially reasonable 
practices in procuring goods and services and when engaging in 
construction activity in accordance with the approved Plan of Operation. 
Such practices shall include procedures to prevent fraud, self-dealing 
and conflicts of interest, and shall foster free and open competition to 
the maximum extent practicable.
    (g) To the extent required by the Program Agreement, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall submit to the Controller, CCC, and to the Director, PDD, 
an inventory of all assets acquired with sale

[[Page 654]]

proceeds or interest or program income. In the event that its 
participation in the program terminates, the Cooperating Sponsor shall 
dispose, at the direction of the Director, PDD, of any property, real or 
personal, so acquired.

Sec. 1499.13  Processing, packaging and labeling of section 416(b) commodities in the foreign country.

    (a) Cooperating Sponsors may arrange for the processing of 
commodities provided under a section 416(b) Program Agreement, or for 
packaging or repackaging prior to distribution. When a third party 
provides such processing, packaging or repackaging, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall enter into a written agreement requiring that the provider 
of such services maintain adequate records to account for all 
commodities delivered and submit periodic reports to the Cooperating 
Sponsor. The Cooperating Sponsor shall submit a copy of the executed 
agreement to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache.
    (b) If, prior to distribution, the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for 
packaging or repackaging commodities provided under section 416(b), the 
packaging shall be plainly labeled in the language of the country in 
which the commodities are to be distributed with the name of the 
commodity and, except where the commodities are to be sold or bartered 
after processing, packaging or repackaging, to indicate that the 
commodity is furnished by the people of the United States of America and 
not to be sold or exchanged. If the commodities are not packaged, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall, to the extent practicable, display banners, 
posters or other media containing the information prescribed in this 
paragraph.
    (c) CCC will reimburse Cooperating Sponsors that are nonprofit 
private voluntary organizations or cooperatives for expenses incurred 
for repackaging if the packages of commodities provided under section 
416(b) are discharged from the vessel in damaged condition, and are 
repackaged to ensure that the commodities arrive at the distribution 
point in wholesome condition. No prior approval is required for such 
expenses equaling $500 or less. If such expense is estimated to exceed 
$500, the authority to repackage and incur such expense must be approved 
by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache in advance of repackaging.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.14  Disposition of commodities unfit for authorized use.

    (a) Prior to delivery to Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or 
point of entry. If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a 
governmental Cooperating Sponsor at discharge port or point of entry 
overseas, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache will immediately arrange 
for inspection by a public health official or other competent authority. 
If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a nongovernmental 
Cooperating Sponsor at the discharge port or point of entry, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for such inspection. 
If inspection discloses the commodity to be unfit for the use authorized 
in the Program Agreement, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose of the commodities in 
accordance with the priority set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Expenses incidental to the handling and disposition of the damaged 
commodity will be paid by CCC from the sale proceeds or from an 
appropriate CCC account designated by CCC. The net proceeds of sales 
shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, 
for the credit of CCC in an appropriate CCC account designated by CCC; 
however, if the commodities are provided for a sales program, the net 
sale proceeds, net of expenses incidental to handling and disposition of 
the damaged commodity, shall be deposited to the special account 
established for sale proceeds. The Cooperating Sponsor shall consult 
with CCC regarding the inspection and disposition of commodities and 
accounting for sale proceeds in the event the Cooperating Sponsor 
executed a sales agreement under which title passed to the purchaser 
prior to delivery to the Cooperating Sponsor.
    (b) After delivery to Cooperating Sponsor. (1) If after arrival in a 
foreign

[[Page 655]]

country and after delivery to a Cooperating Sponsor, it appears that the 
commodity, or any part thereof, may be unfit for the use authorized in 
the Program Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately arrange 
for inspection of the commodity by a public health official or other 
competent authority approved by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. 
If no competent local authority is available, the Agricultural Counselor 
or Attache may determine whether the commodities are unfit for the use 
authorized in the Program Agreement and, if so, may direct disposal in 
accordance with this paragraph (b) of this section. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall arrange for the recovery of that portion of the 
commodities designated during the inspection as suitable for authorized 
use. If, upon inspection, the commodity (or any part thereof) is 
determined to be unfit for the authorized use, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache of the circumstances 
pertaining to the loss or damage. With the concurrence of the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache, the commodity determined to be unfit 
for authorized use shall be disposed of in the following order of 
priority:
    (i) By transfer to an approved section 416(b) program for use as 
livestock feed. CCC shall be advised promptly of any such transfer so 
that shipments from the United States to the livestock feeding program 
can be reduced by an equivalent amount;
    (ii) Sale for the most appropriate use, i.e., animal feed, 
fertilizer, or industrial use, at the highest obtainable price. When the 
commodity is sold, all U.S. Government markings shall be obliterated or 
removed;
    (iii) By donation to a governmental or charitable organization for 
use as animal feed or for other non-food use; or
    (iv) If the commodity is unfit for any use or if disposal in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section is 
not possible, the commodity shall be destroyed under the observation of 
a representative of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, if 
practicable, in such manner as to prevent its use for any purpose.
    (2) Actual expenses incurred, including third party costs, in 
effecting any sale may be deducted from the sale proceeds and, if the 
commodities were intended for direct distribution, the Cooperating 
Sponsor shall deposit the net proceeds with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, 
American Embassy, with instructions to credit the deposit to an 
appropriate CCC account as designated by CCC. If the commodities were 
intended to be sold, the Cooperating Sponsor shall deposit the gross 
proceeds into the special interest bearing account and, after approved 
costs related to the handling and disposition of damaged commodities are 
paid, shall use the remaining funds for purposes of the approved 
program. The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly furnish to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache a written report of all circumstances 
relating to the loss and damage on any commodity loss in excess of 
$5,000; quarterly reports shall be made on all other losses. If the 
commodity was inspected by a public health official or other competent 
authority, the report and any supplemental report shall include a 
certification by such public health official or other competent 
authority as to the condition of the commodity and the exact quantity of 
the damaged commodity disposed. Such certification shall be obtained as 
soon as possible after the discharge of the cargo. A report must also be 
provided to the Chief, Debt Management Division, KCMO/DMD, of action 
taken to dispose of commodities unfit for authorized use.

[61 FR 60515, Nov. 29, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 59877, Nov. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1499.15  Liability for loss, damage, or improper distribution of commodities--claims and procedures.

    (a) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor prior to loading on ocean vessel. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify KCCO, Chief, Export 
Operations Division if the Cooperating Sponsor will not have a vessel 
for loading at the U.S. port of export in accordance with the agreed 
shipping schedule. CCC will determine whether the commodity will be: 
moved to another available outlet; stored at the port for delivery to 
the Cooperating Sponsor when a vessel is

[[Page 656]]

available for loading; or disposed of as CCC may deem proper. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall take such action as directed by CCC and shall 
reimburse CCC for expenses incurred if CCC determines that the expenses 
were incurred because of the fault or negligence of the Cooperating 
Sponsor.
    (b) Fault of others prior to loading on ocean vessel. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately notify the Chief, Debt Management 
Office, KCMO/DMD, when any damage or loss to the commodity occurs that 
is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier, or other person between the 
time title is transferred to a Cooperating Sponsor and the time the 
commodity is loaded on board vessel at the designated port of export. 
The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly assign to CCC any rights to 
claims which may arise as a result of such loss or damage and shall 
promptly forward to CCC all documents pertaining thereto. CCC shall have 
the right to initiate claims, and retain the proceeds of all claims, for 
such loss or damage.
    (c) Survey and outturn reports related to claims against ocean 
carriers. (1) If the Program Agreement provides that CCC will arrange 
for an independent cargo surveyor to attend the discharge of the cargo, 
CCC will require the surveyor to provide a copy of the report to the 
Cooperating Sponsor.
    (2)(i) If the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for an independent cargo 
surveyor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall forward to the Chief, Debt 
Management Office, KCMO/DMD, any narrative chronology or other 
commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean 
transportation claims and shall prepare such a narrative in any case 
where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00. The 
Cooperating Sponsor may, at its option, also engage the independent 
surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs 
or port areas to the Cooperating Sponsor or its agent and to issue 
delivery survey reports thereon.
    (ii) In the event of cargo loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall provide to the Chief, Debt Management Office, KCMO/DMD, the names 
and addresses of individuals who were present at the time of discharge 
and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. For 
bulk grain shipments, in those cases where the Cooperating Sponsor is 
responsible for survey and outturn reports, the Cooperating Sponsor 
shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to:
    (A) Observe the discharge of the cargo;
    (B) Report on discharging methods including scale type, calibrations 
and any other factor which may affect the accuracy of scale weights, 
and, if scales are not used, state the reason therefore and describe the 
actual method used to determine weights;
    (C) Estimate the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge 
through carrier negligence;
    (D) Advise on the quality of sweepings;
    (E) Obtain copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing 
quantity discharged;
    (F) Provide immediate notification to the Cooperating Sponsor if 
additional services are necessary to protect cargo interests or if the 
surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not 
discharged; and
    (G) In the case of shipments arriving in container vans, list the 
container van numbers and seal numbers shown on the container vans, and 
indicate whether the seals were intact at the time the container vans 
were opened, and whether the container vans were in any way damaged. To 
the extent possible, the independent surveyor should observe discharge 
of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the 
container van occurred and arrange for surveying as container vans are 
opened.
    (iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCMO/DMD, Chief, 
Debt Management Office of all reports and documents pertaining to the 
discharge of commodities.
    (iv) CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for costs incurred 
upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other 
documents that establish the survey cost. CCC will not reimburse a 
Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of a delivery survey unless the 
surveyor also prepares a discharge survey, or for any other survey not

[[Page 657]]

taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless CCC 
determines that such action was justified in the circumstances.
    (3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless 
CCC determines that the use of competitive bids would not be 
practicable. CCC may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of 
conflicts of interest or lack of demonstrated capability to properly 
carry out surveying responsibilities.
    (4) If practicable, all surveys shall be conducted jointly by the 
surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report 
shall be signed by all parties.
    (d) Ocean carrier loss and damage. (1) Notwithstanding transfer of 
title, CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and retain the proceeds 
of collection from claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss 
and damage arising out of shipments of commodities provided to 
governmental Cooperating Sponsors; however, when the Cooperating Sponsor 
pays the ocean freight or a portion thereof, it shall be entitled to pro 
rata reimbursement received from any claims related to ocean freight 
charged. CCC will pay general average contributions for all valid 
general average incidents which may arise from the movement of commodity 
to the destination ports. CCC shall receive and retain all allowances in 
general average.
    (2) Nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors shall: file notice with the 
ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any cargo loss or damage; 
promptly initiate claims against the ocean carriers for such loss and 
damage; take all necessary action to obtain restitution for losses, and 
(iv) provide CCC copies of all such claims. Notwithstanding the 
preceding sentence the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor need not file 
a claim when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the 
loss is between $100 and $300 and the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor determines that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will 
exceed the amount of the claim. The nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor 
shall transmit to KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt Management Office information 
and documentation on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to 
be filed. In the event of a declaration General Average:
    (i) The Cooperating Sponsor shall assign all claim rights to CCC and 
shall provide CCC all documentation relating to the claim, if 
applicable;
    (ii) CCC will be responsible for settling general average and marine 
salvage claims;
    (iii) CCC has sole authority to authorize any disposition of 
commodities which have not commenced ocean transit or of which the ocean 
transit is interrupted;
    (iv) CCC will receive and retain any monetary proceeds resulting 
from such disposition;
    (v) CCC will initiate, prosecute, and retain all proceeds of cargo 
loss and damage against ocean carriers and any allowance in general 
average; and
    (vi) CCC will pay any general average or marine salvage claims 
determined to be due.
    (3) Amounts collected by nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors on 
claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained 
by the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor. On claims involving loss or 
damage of $200 or more, nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors may retain 
from collections received by them, either $200 plus 10 percent of the 
difference between $200 and the total amount collected on the claim, up 
to a maximum of $500; or the actual administrative expenses incurred in 
collection of the claim, provided retention of such administrative 
expenses is approved by CCC. Allowable collection costs shall not 
include attorneys fees, fees of collection agencies, and similar costs. 
In no event will CCC pay collection costs in excess of the amount 
collected on the claim.
    (4) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor also may retain from claim 
recoveries remaining after allowable deductions for administrative 
expenses of collection, the amount of any special charges, such as 
handling and packing costs, which the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor has incurred on the lost or damaged commodity and which are 
included in the claims and paid by the liable party.
    (5) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may redetermine claims on

[[Page 658]]

the basis of additional documentation or information not considered when 
the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information 
clearly changes the ocean carrier's liability. Approval of such changes 
by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of 
redetermined claims and supporting documentation or information shall be 
furnished to CCC.
    (6) A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may negotiate compromise 
settlements of claims of any amount, provided that proposed compromise 
settlements of claims having a value of $5,000 or more shall require 
prior approval in writing by CCC. When a claim is compromised, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may retain from the amount 
collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, 
and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the special 
charges described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section as compromised 
amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is less than 
$600, a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor may terminate collection 
activity when it is determined that pursuit of such claims will not be 
economically sound. Approval for such termination by CCC is not 
required; however, the nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall notify 
KCMO/DMD, Chief, Debt Management Division when collection activity on a 
claim is terminated.
    (7) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized in 
this section to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the purpose of 
determining the amount to be retained by a nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against ocean carriers, the 
word ``claim'' shall refer to the loss and damage to commodities which 
are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port 
destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the 
number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier.
    (8) If a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor is unable to effect 
collection of a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement 
within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof 
granted in writing by the party alleged responsible for the damage, the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall assign its rights to the claim 
to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of legal action prior to 
the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. 
Generally, a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor should assign claim 
rights to CCC no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the 
period of limitation or any extension thereof. In all cases, a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor shall keep CCC informed of the 
progress of its collection efforts and shall promptly assign their claim 
rights to CCC upon request. Subsequently, if CCC collects on or settles 
the claim, CCC shall, except as indicated in this paragraph pay to a 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor the amount to which it would have 
been entitled had it collected on the claim. The additional 10 percent 
on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable, however, only if 
CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim 
prior to the assignment, or if payment is determined to be commensurate 
with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting the claim. If 
documentation requirements have not been fulfilled and the lack of such 
documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction of CCC, CCC 
will deny payment of all allowances to the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor.
    (9) When a nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor permits a claim to 
become time-barred, or fails to take timely actions to insure the right 
of CCC to assert such claims, and CCC determines that the 
nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor failed to properly exercise its 
responsibilities under the Agreement, the nongovernmental Cooperating 
Sponsor shall be liable to the United States for the cost and freight 
value of the commodities lost to the program.
    (e) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor in country of distribution. If a 
commodity, sale proceeds or program income is used for a purpose not 
permitted by the Program Agreement, or if a Cooperating Sponsor causes 
loss or damage to a commodity, sale proceeds, or program income through 
any act or omission or

[[Page 659]]

failure to provide proper storage, care and handling, the cooperating 
sponsor shall pay to the United States the value of the commodities, 
sale proceeds or program income lost, damaged or misused. CCC will 
consider normal commercial practices in the country of distribution in 
determining whether there was a proper exercise of the Cooperating 
Sponsor's responsibility. Payment by the Cooperating Sponsor shall be 
made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Fault of others in country of distribution and in intermediate 
country. (1) In addition to survey or outturn reports to determine ocean 
carrier loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor shall, in the case of 
landlocked countries, arrange for an independent survey at the point of 
entry into the recipient country and make a report as set forth in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will reimburse the Cooperating 
Sponsor for the costs of survey as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of 
this section.
    (2) Where any damage to or loss of the commodity or any loss of sale 
proceeds or program income is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier or 
other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort 
to pursue collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file 
or pursue such claims shall be liable to CCC for the value of the 
commodities or sale proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or 
misused: Provided, however, that the Cooperating Sponsor may elect not 
to file a claim if the loss is less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In 
addition, Cooperating Sponsors may, with the written approval of the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache, retain amounts to cover special costs 
of collection such as legal fees, or pay such collection costs with sale 
proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than the 
full amount of the claim requires prior approval by the Agricultural 
Counselor or Attache. When the Cooperating Sponsor has exhausted all 
reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache to provide further instructions.
    (3) The Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial 
billings and at least three subsequent demands at not more than 30 day 
intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, the 
Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue legal action in the judicial system of 
country unless otherwise agreed by the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache. The Cooperating Sponsors must inform the Agricultural Counselor 
or Attache in writing of the reasons for not pursuing legal action; and 
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require the Cooperating 
Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its 
decision prior to granting approval. If the Agricultural Counselor or 
Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further 
action on the claim, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the claim to 
CCC and shall forward all documentation relating to the claim to KCMO/
DMD.
    (4) As an alternative to legal action in the judicial system of the 
country with regard to claims against a public entity of the government 
of the cooperating country, the Cooperating Sponsor and the cooperating 
country may agree in writing to settle disputed claims by an appropriate 
administrative procedure or arbitration.
    (g) Determination of value. The Cooperating Sponsor shall determine 
the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged on the basis of the 
domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage 
occurred. When it is not feasible to determine such market price, the 
value shall be the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the 
commodity at the time and place of export, plus ocean freight charges 
and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to 
the Cooperating Sponsor. When the value is determined on a cost basis, 
the Cooperating Sponsor may add to the value any provable costs it has 
incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim 
statement, these costs shall be clearly segregated from costs incurred 
by the

[[Page 660]]

Government of the United States. With respect to claims other than ocean 
carrier loss or damage claims, the Cooperating Sponsor may request the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache to approve a commercially reasonable 
alternative basis to value the claim.
    (h) Reporting losses to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC 
designated representative. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly 
notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated 
representative, in writing, of the circumstances pertaining to any loss, 
damage, or misuse of commodities valued at $500 or more occurring within 
the country of distribution or intermediate country. The report shall be 
made as soon as the Cooperating Sponsor has adequately investigated the 
circumstances, but in no event more than ninety days from the date the 
loss became known to the Cooperating Sponsor. The report shall identify 
the party in possession of the commodities and the party responsible for 
the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantities of commodities; the 
size and type of containers; the time and place of misuse, loss, or 
damage; the current location of the commodity; the Program Agreement 
number, the CCC contract numbers, or if unknown, other identifying 
numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action taken by the 
Cooperating Sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the 
estimated value of the commodity. The report shall explain why any of 
the information required by this paragraph cannot be provided. The 
Cooperating Sponsor shall also report the details regarding any loss or 
misuse of sale proceeds or program income.
    (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall report quarterly to the 
Agricultural Counselor or Attache any loss, damage to or misuse of 
commodities resulting in loss of less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor 
shall inform the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated 
representative if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend 
in the loss, damage, or misuse of such commodities and submit a report 
as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, together with any 
other relevant information the Cooperating Sponsor has available to it. 
The Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require additional information 
about any commodities lost, damaged or misused.
    (i) Handling claims proceeds. Claims against ocean carriers shall be 
collected in U.S. dollars (or in the currency in which freight is paid) 
and shall be remitted (less amounts authorized to be retained) by 
Cooperating Sponsors to CCC. Claims against Cooperating Sponsors shall 
be paid to CCC in U.S. dollars. With respect to commodities lost, 
damaged or misused, amounts paid by Cooperating Sponsors and third 
parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the U.S. 
Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably in U.S. dollars with 
instructions to credit the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as 
determined by CCC, or in local currency at the highest rate of exchange 
legally obtainable on the date of deposit with instructions to credit 
the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC. With 
respect to sale proceeds and program income, amounts recovered may be 
deposited in the same account as the sale proceeds and may be used for 
purposes of the program.

<R05>
Sec. 1499.16  Records and reporting requirements.

    (a) Records and reports--general requirements. The Cooperating 
Sponsor shall maintain records for a period of three (3) years from the 
date of export of the commodities that accurately reflect the receipt 
and use of the commodities and any proceeds realized from the sale of 
commodities. The Government of the Exporting Country may, at reasonable 
times, inspect the Cooperating Sponsor's records pertaining to the 
receipt and use of the commodities and proceeds realized from the sale 
of the commodities, and have access to the Cooperating Sponsor's 
commodity storage and distribution sites and to locations of activities 
supported with proceeds realized from the sale of the commodities.
    (b) Evidence of export. The Cooperating Sponsor's freight forwarder 
shall, within thirty (30) days after export,

[[Page 661]]

submit evidence of export of the agricultural commodities to the Chief, 
Export Operations Division, KCCO. If export is by sea or air, the 
Cooperating Sponsor's freight forwarder shall submit five copies of the 
carrier's on board bill of lading or consignee's receipt authenticated 
by a representative of the U.S. Customs Service. The evidence of export 
must show the kind and quantity of agricultural commodities exported, 
the date of export, and the destination country.
    (c) Reports. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall submit a semiannual 
logistics report to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache and to the 
Director, CCC Program Support Division, FAS/USDA, Washington, DC 20250-
1031, covering the receipt of commodities. Cooperating sponsors must 
submit reports on Form CCC-620 and submit the first report by May 16 for 
agreements signed during the period, October 1 through March 31, or by 
November 16 for agreements signed during the period, April 1 through 
September 30. The first report must cover the time period from the date 
of signing and subsequent reports must be provided at six months

Audits shall be performed at least annually until all commodities have 
been distributed and sale proceeds expended. Both the auditor and the 
auditing standards to be used by the Cooperating Sponsor must be 
acceptable to CCC. The Cooperating Sponsor is also responsible for

the Program Agreement or this part;
    (b) CCC determines that the continuation of such assistance is no 
longer necessary or desirable; or
    (c) CCC determines that storage facilities are inadequate to prevent 
spoilage or waste, or that distribution of commodities will result in 
substantial disincentive to, or interference with, domestic production 
or marketing in the recipient country.


<R05>
Sec. 1499.19  Sample documents and guidelines for developing proposals and reports.

    CCC has developed guidelines to assist the Cooperating Sponsors in 
developing proposals and reporting on program logistics and commodity

or if such credit has been granted, shall promptly (within 5 business 
days of the filing of a drawback entry) notify the Licensing Authority 
and request that such credit be revoked, if the exportation of such 
refined sugar or any sugar containing product manufactured with the use

of a claim by the licensee or any other person for, a refund, as 
drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any sugars, syrups or 
molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22,

<R05>
Sec. 1530.102  Issuance of a license.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Licensing Authority, 
may issue a license to a refiner under which the refiner may import 
sugar described in HTS subheading 1701.11.02 in accordance with the 
provisions of this program. The license may contain such conditions, 
limitations or restrictions as the Licensing Authority determines to be 
appropriate for the purposes of this program. The Licensing Authority 
may add or modify such conditions, limitations or restrictions at such 
time and in such manner as the Licensing Authority, in his or her 
discretion, determines to be necessary or appropriate for the purposes 
of this program. A refiner may hold only one license at any given time.
    (b) A quantity of refined sugar equivalent to the quantity of sugar, 
raw value, imported under a license, adjusted in accordance with 
Sec. 1530.107 of this subpart, must be exported within 90 days of the 
date of entry of such sugar or must be transferred to a manufacturer 
within 90 days of the date of entry of such sugar.
    (c) The maximum license amount is 50,000 metric tons of sugar, raw 
value. Quantities of sugar imported under the license will be charged to 
the license and quantities of refined sugar exported or transferred will 
be credited to the license as provided in Sec. 1530.107. At no time may

1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 2106.90.12 of the HTS is claimed 
or received on the basis, or as a result, of the exportation of such 
refined sugar or any sugar containing products manufactured with the use 
of such transferred sugar.
    (e) If a licensee has made a full settlement of the balance on a 
license, the licensee may surrender the license on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Licensing Authority. A licensee may,

[[Page 669]]

with the written permission of the Licensing Authority, transfer a 
license to another refiner who does not hold a license, subject to such 
terms and conditions as the Licensing Authority may impose as he or she 
determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of 
this subpart.
    (f) The licensee may utilize an agent to import, export or make 
transfers of sugar. The licensee must provide to the Licensing Authority 
a written authorization designating such person to act as an agent for 
the purpose of importing, exporting or transferring sugar. If the 
licensee uses an agent to export the refined sugar, the licensee shall 
notify the Licensing Authority in writing of the agent's identity, and 
the agent shall certify to the Licensing Authority in writing that the 
refined sugar has been exported from the customs territory of the United 
States.

<R05>
Sec. 1530.103  Bond requirements.

    (a) Unless the licensee has posted a performance bond with the U.S. 
Customs Service which is satisfactory to the Licensing Authority with 
respect to the requirements of this program, the licensee shall post a 
performance bond which meets the requirements of this section with the 
Licensing Authority. However, no bond will be required for the quantity 
of any sugar imported under license that corresponds to a quantity of 
sugar that has been exported or transferred prior to the importation of 
such sugar and credited to the license in accordance with Sec. 1530.107, 
provided that the Licensing Authority issues a written waiver of the 
bond requirement.
    (b) A bond may cover entries made either during the period of time 
specified in the bond (term bond) or for a specified entry (single entry 
bond).
    (c) Only the licensee who will process (refine) the sugar may be the 
principal on a bond to cover such sugar to be re-exported in refined 
form. The surety or sureties shall be among those listed by the 
Secretary of the Treasury as acceptable on Federal bonds.
    (d) The obligation under the bond shall be made effective as of the 
date of entry of the imported sugar.
    (e) The amount of the bond shall be equal to 20 cents per pound of 
sugar imported under the license.
    (f) The appropriate customs official or the Licensing Authority, as 
appropriate, will release the obligation under the bond by 20 cents per 
pound for the quantity of sugar credited to the license in accordance 
with Sec. 1530.107.
    (g) If the licensee fails to qualify for a credit to the license 
within 95 days of the date of export of corresponding sugar in an amount 
sufficient to offset the charge to the license for that corresponding 
sugar or if such a credit initially granted is subsequently revoked, 
payment will be made to the United States of America under the bond of a 
monetary amount equal to the difference between the Number 11 contract 
price and the Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, in 
effect on the last market day before the date of entry of the sugar or 
the last market day before the end of the period during which export was 
required, whichever difference is greater, times the quantity of refined 
sugar, converted to raw value, that should have been, but was not,

Sec. 1530.107  Charges and credits to licenses.

    (a) Charges will be made to a license, effective as of the date of 
entry, for quantities of sugar (adjusted on the basis set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section to determine raw value) entered under the 
license, when the licensee submits the information required by 
Sec. 1530.104 or when the Licensing Authority otherwise determines that 
the licensee has made an entry under subheading 1701.11.02 of the HTS.
    (b) At the request of the licensee and upon satisfactory and timely 
proof that the licensee has complied with all of the requirements of 
this program, the Licensing Authority will credit a license for:
    (1) Quantities of refined sugar, adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section, for which proof of export has been submitted in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1530.105 of this subpart, but 
such credit, if granted conditionally, will become final only when the 
Licensing Authority is satisfied that no refund, as drawback, of any 
duties paid on the importation of any sugars, syrups or molasses 
described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02,

    (2) Quantities of refined sugar, adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section, for which a Notice of Transfer has been submitted to 
the Licensing Authority in accordance with Sec. 1530.106 of this 
subpart; and
    (3) Quantities of sugar charged to the license which the Licensing 
Authority determines have been destroyed, lost in processing the sugar, 
or otherwise disposed of so as to render the exportation or transfer of 
a corresponding quantity of sugar impossible or unnecessary.
    (c) Adjustments of the quantities of imported sugar charged to the 
license and refined sugar exports credited to the license will be made 
as follows:
    (1) To obtain the raw value for imported sugar with a polarization 
of 92 degrees or above, the adjustment will be made by multiplying the 
polarization times 0.0175, subtracting 0.68 from this product, and 
multiplying the difference by the weight. Expressed algebraically, this 
formula is: [(polarization  x  0.0175) -0.68]  x  weight.
    (2) To obtain the raw value for imported sugar with a polarization 
of less than 92 degrees, the adjustment will be made by dividing the 
total sugar content by 0.972.
    (3) To determine the quantity of refined sugar that must be exported 
to

[[Page 672]]

equal a corresponding quantity of imported sugar charged to a license, 
the adjustment will be made by dividing the quantity of sugar imported, 
expressed in raw value, by 1.07.
    (d) The Licensing Authority may revoke any credit previously made to 
a license is the Licensing Authority determines, on the basis of 
evidence obtained after the credit was granted, that the licensee had 
not complied with all of the requirements of this subpart or if the 
exported sugar is re-exported or returned to the customs territory of 
the United States without having undergone a substantial transformation.

occur any time after the date on which the license was issued by the 
Licensing Authority. Any quantity of sugar exported or transferred after 
the date on which the license was issued, but prior to the entry of the

Sec. 1530.110  Enforcement.

    (a) If at any time after receiving the proof of export described in 
Sec. 1530.105 of this subpart, the Licensing Authority determines that 
the export of a quantity of refined sugar corresponding to the quantity 
of sugar entered under the license did not occur, and if the bond has 
been released under Sec. 1530.103, the Licensing Authority may hold the 
licensee liable for the difference between the Number 11 contract price 
and the Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, in effect on 
the last market day before the date of entry of the sugar or the last 
market day before the end of the period during which export was 
required, whichever difference is greater, times the quantity of refined 
sugar, converted to raw value, that should have been, but was not, 
exported. In the event no Number 11 contract price or Number 14 contract 
price is reported by the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, for 
the relevant market day, the Licensing Authority may estimate such price 
as he or she deems appropriate.
    (b) If at any time after receiving the licensee's certification that 
no refund, as drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any 
sugars, syrups or molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 
1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 
2106.90.12 of the HTS has been or will be claimed or received on the 
basis, or as a result, of the exportation of any refined sugar, the 
Licensing Authority determines that a refund of such customs duties has 
been claimed or received by the licensee or any other person, and if the 
bond has been released under Sec. 1530.103, the Licensing Authority may 
hold the licensee liable for the difference between the Number 11 
contract price and the Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, 
in effect on the last market day before the date of entry of the sugar 
or the last market day before the end of the period during which export 
was required, whichever difference is greater, times the quantity of 
sugar, converted to raw value, that should have been, but was not, 
exported. In the event no Number 11 contract price or Number 14 contract 
price is reported by the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, for 
the relevant market day, the Licensing Authority may estimate such price 
as he or she deems appropriate.
    (c) If at any time the Licensing Authority determines that a 
licensee has failed to comply with the requirements of this subpart, 
including the requirements of HTS subheading 1701.11.02 and of the 
relevant provisions of additional U.S. note 3, the Licensing Authority 
may, after notice to the licensee, suspend or revoke the license issued 
to the licensee under this program and may refuse to issue a license to 
that refiner. The Licensing Authority may suspend or revoke a license if 
claims are filed under 19 CFR part 191 for the refund, as drawback, of 
any duties paid on the importation of any sugars, syrups or molasses 
described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02,

result, of the exportation of refined sugar under this program or if any 
claim under 19 CFR part 191 is denied on the basis that such refined 
sugar was not exported.

claim by the licensee or any other person for, a refund, as drawback, of 
any duties paid on the importation of any sugars, syrups or molasses 
described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02,

<R05>
Sec. 1530.202  Issuance of a license.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Licensing Authority, 
may issue a license to a manufacturer under which the manufacturer, in 
accordance with the provisions of this program, may receive transfers of 
sugar from refiners for the purpose of manufacturing sugar containing 
products to be exported. The license may contain such conditions, 
limitations, or restrictions as the Licensing Authority determines to be 
appropriate for the purposes of this program. The Licensing Authority 
may add or modify such conditions, limitations or restrictions at such 
time and in such manner as the Licensing Authority, in his or her 
discretion, determines to be necessary or appropriate for the purposes 
of this program.
    (b) A quantity of sugar equivalent to the quantity of sugar 
transferred under a license must be exported in a sugar containing 
product within 18 months of the date of transfer from the refiner. 
However, the Licensing Authority may credit a license for valueless 
sugar lost in normal product manufacture.
    (c) The maximum license amount is 10,000 short tons (20 million 
pounds) of sugar. Quantities of sugar transferred under the license will 
be charged to the license and quantities of sugar contained in sugar 
containing products exported will be credited to the license as provided 
in Sec. 1530.206. At no time may the outstanding balance of charges or 
credits exceed the maximum license amount.
    (d) The licensee shall reserve all rights, if any, to claim drawback 
refunds with respect to the exportation of sugar containing products 
under this program. No credit on a license shall be made if any refund, 
as drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any sugars, syrups 
or molasses described in subheading 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 
1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 2106.90.12 of the HTS is claimed 
or received on the basis, or as

[[Page 677]]

a result, of the exportation of the sugar containing product.
    (e) If a licensee has made a full settlement of the balance on a 
license, the licensee may surrender the license on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Licensing Authority. A licensee may, with the written 
permission of the Licensing Authority, transfer a license to another 
manufacturer who does not hold a license, subject to such terms and 
conditions as the Licensing Authority may impose as he or she determines 
to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this 
subpart.
    (f) The licensee may utilize an agent for the transfer of refined 
sugar or the exportation of sugar containing products. The agent must, 
upon request, produce for inspection by the Licensing Authority written 
authorization designating such person to act as an agent for the purpose 
of receiving transferred sugar. If the licensee uses an agent to export 
sugar containing products, the licensee shall notify the Licensing 
Authority in writing of the agent's identity, and the agent shall 
certify to the Licensing Authority in writing that the sugar containing 
products have been exported from the customs territory of the United 
States.

<R05>
Sec. 1530.203  Bond requirements.

    (a) A licensee shall post a performance bond, which meets the 
requirements of this section, with the Licensing Authority. However, no 
bond will be required for the quantity of any sugar transferred under 
license that corresponds to a quantity of sugar that has been exported 
in sugar containing products prior to the transfer of such sugar and 
credited to the license in accordance with Sec. 1530.206, provided that 
the Licensing Authority issues a written waiver of the bond requirement.
    (b) A bond may cover transfers made either during the period of time 
specified in the bond (term bond) or for a specified transfer (single 
entry bond).
    (c) Only the licensee who will use the sugar may be the principal on 
a bond to cover such sugar to be transferred. The surety or sureties 
shall be among those listed by the Secretary of the Treasury as 
acceptable on Federal bonds.
    (d) The obligation under the bond shall be made effective as of the 
date of transfer of the corresponding sugar.
    (e) The amount of the bond shall be equal to 20 cents per pound of 
sugar transferred under the license.
    (f) The Licensing Authority will release the obligation under the 
bond for transferred sugar by 20 cents per pound for the quantity of 
sugar credited to the license in accordance with Sec. 1530.206, as 
determined by the Licensing Authority.
    (g) If the licensee fails to qualify for a credit to the license 
within 95 days of the date of export of sugar containing products or the 
last date on which such products should have been exported, whichever 
occurs first, in an amount sufficient to offset the charge to the 
license for corresponding sugar, or if such a credit initially granted 
is subsequently revoked, payment will be made to the United States of 
America under the bond of a monetary amount equal to the difference 
between the Number 11 contract price and the Number 14 contract price, 
per pound of raw sugar, in effect on the last market day before the date 
of entry of the sugar or the last marketday before the end of the period 
during which export was required, whichever difference is greater, times 
the quantity of refined sugar, converted to raw value, that should have 
been, but was not, exported in the form of sugar containing products in 
timely compliance with the requirements of this subpart. In the event no 
Number 11 contract price or Number 14 contract price is reported by the 
New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, for the relevant market day, 
the Licensing Authority may estimate such price as he or she deems 
appropriate.
    (h) Within 10 business days of the date of issuance of a license, 
the licensee shall submit to the Licensing Authority a copy of the 
performance bond.

Sec. 1530.206  Charges and credits to licenses.

    (a) Charges will be made to a license for quantities of sugar 
transferred under the license, effective as of the date of transfer, 
when the licensee submits the information required by Sec. 1530.204 or 
when the Licensing Authority otherwise determines that a transfer has 
been made.
    (b) At the request of the licensee and upon satisfactory and timely 
proof that the licensee has complied with all of the requirements of 
this program, the Licensing Authority will credit a license for:
    (1) Quantities of sugar in the sugar containing products for which 
proof of export has been submitted in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1530.205 of this subpart, but such credit, if granted 
conditionally, will become final only when the Licensing Authority is 
satisfied that no refund, as drawback, of any duties paid on the

of a corresponding quantity of sugar in sugar containing products 
impossible or unnecessary.
    (c) The Licensing Authority may revoke any credit previously made to 
a license if the Licensing Authority determines, on the basis of 
evidence obtained after the credit was granted, that the licensee had 
not complied with all of the requirements of this subpart or if the 
exported sugar containing products are re-exported or returned to the 
customs territory of the United States without having undergone a 
substantial transformation.

Sec. 1530.209  Enforcement.

    (a) If at any time after receiving the proof of export described in 
Sec. 1530.205 of this subpart, the Licensing Authority determines that 
the export of sugar in the form of sugar containing products 
corresponding to the quantity of sugar transferred under the license did 
not occur, and has not been otherwise disposed of or lost in the 
manufacturing process as valueless sugar, and if the bond has been 
released under Sec. 1530.203, the Licensing Authority may hold the 
licensee liable for the difference between the Number 11 contract price 
and the Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, in effect on 
the last market day before the date of transfer of the sugar or the last 
market day before the end of the period during which export was 
required, whichever difference is greater, times the quantity of sugar, 
converted to raw value, that should have been, but was not, exported in 
sugar containing products. In the event no Number 11 contract price or 
Number 14 contract price is reported by the New York Coffee, Sugar and 
Cocoa Exchange, for the relevant market day, the Licensing Authority may 
estimate such price as he or she deems appropriate.
    (b) If at any time after receiving the licensee's certification that 
no refund, as drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any 
sugars, syrups or molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 
1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 
2106.90.12 of the HTS has been or will be claimed or received on the 
basis, or as a result, of the exportation of any sugar containing 
product, the Licensing Authority determines that a refund of such 
customs duties has been claimed or received by the licensee or any other 
person, and if the bond has been released

[[Page 681]]

under Sec. 1530.203, the Licensing Authority may hold the licensee 
liable for the difference between the Number 11 contract price and the 
Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, in effect on the last 
market day before the date of transfer of the sugar or the last market 
day before the end of the period during which export was required, 
whichever difference is greater, times the quantity of sugar, converted 
to raw value, that should have been, but was not, exported in sugar 
containing products. In the event no Number 11 contract price or Number 
14 contract price is reported by the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa 
Exchange, for the relevant market day, the Licensing Authority may 
estimate such price as he or she deems appropriate.
    (c) If at any time the Licensing Authority determines that a 
licensee has failed to comply with the requirements of this subpart, 
including the requirements of HTS subheading 1701.11.02 and of the 
relevant provisions of additional U.S. note 3, the Licensing Authority 
may, after notice to the licensee, suspend or revoke the license issued 
to the licensee under this program and may refuse to issue a license to 
that manufacturer. The Licensing Authority may suspend or revoke a 
license if claims are filed under 19 CFR part 191 for the refund, as 
drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any sugars, syrups or 
molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 
1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 2106.90.12 of the HTS on the 
basis, or as a result, of the exportation of a sugar containing product 
under this program or if any other claim under 19 CFR part 191 is denied 
on the basis that the sugar containing product was not exported.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Licensing Authority, 
may issue a license to a manufacturer under which the manufacturer, in 
accordance with the provisions of this program, may enter raw cane sugar 
described in subheading 1701.11.02 of the HTS for the sole purpose of 
producing (other than by distillation) polyhydric alcohols, except 
polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute for sugar in human food 
consumption. The license shall state the maximum amount of sugar which 
may be imported under the license. The license may contain such 
additional conditions, limitations or restrictions as the Licensing 
Authority determines to be appropriate for the purposes of this program. 
The Licensing Authority may add or modify such conditions, limitations 
or restrictions at such time and in such manner as the Licensing 
Authority, in his or her discretion, determines to be necessary or 
appropriate for the purposes of this program.
    (b) The total quantity of sugar imported under a license must be 
used or the sole purpose of producing (other than by distillation) 
polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute 
for sugar in human food consumption, within 180 days of the date of 
entry of such sugar.
    (c) The maximum amount of sugar which may be imported under the 
license will be the requirements of the manufacturer for sugar to be 
used in the production (other than by distillation) of polyhydric 
alcohols, except

[[Page 684]]

polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute for sugar in human food 
consumption, during the 12-month period following the effective date of 
the license, as determined by the Licensing Authority. Quantities of 
sugar imported under the license will be charged to the license and 
quantities of sugar used for the sole purpose of producing (other than 
by distillation) polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use 
as a substitute for sugar in human food consumption, will be credited to 
the license as provided in Sec. 1530.306. At no time may the charges to 
the license exceed the maximum license amount specified in the license.
    (d) The licensee shall reserve all rights, if any, to claim drawback 
refunds with respect to the exportation of polyhydric alcohols under 
this program. No credit on a license shall be made if any refund, as 
drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any sugars, syrups or 
molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 
1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 2106.90.12 of the HTS is claimed 
or received on the basis, or as a result, of the exportation of such

    (e) If a licensee has made a full settlement of the balance on a 
license, the licensee may surrender the license on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Licensing Authority. A licensee may not transfer a 
license to any other person. Any attempt to transfer or assign a license 
shall be null and void and shall be grounds for the revocation of the 
license by the Licensing Authority.
    (f) The licensee may utilize an agent to enter imported sugar. The 
licensee must provide to the Licensing Authority a copy of a written 
authorization designating such person to act as an agent for the purpose 
of entering sugar, and the agent shall produce such authorization for 
inspection by the appropriate U.S. Customs Service official at the time 
of entry. If the licensee uses an agent to export polyhydric alcohol, 
the licensee shall notify the Licensing Authority in writing of the 
agent's identity.

Sec. 1530.303  Bond requirements.

    (a) Unless the licensee has posted a performance bond with the U.S. 
Customs Service which is satisfactory to the Licensing Authority with 
respect to the requirements of this program, the licensee shall post a 
performance bond, which meets the requirements of this section, with the 
Licensing Authority.
    (b) A bond may cover entries made either during the period of time 
specified in the bond (term bond) or for a specified entry (single entry 
bond).
    (c) Only the licensee who will use the sugar may be the principal on 
a bond to cover such sugar to be imported. The surety or sureties shall 
be among those listed by the Secretary of the Treasury as acceptable on 
Federal bonds.
    (d) The obligation under the bond shall be made effective as of the 
date of entry of the sugar.
    (e) The amount of the bond shall be equal to 20 cents per pound of 
sugar imported under the license.
    (f) The appropriate customs official or the Licensing Authority, as 
appropriate, will release the obligation under the bond by 20 cents per 
pound for the quantity of sugar used in the production of polyhydric 
alcohols and credited to the license in accordance with Sec. 1530.306, 
as determined by the Licensing Authority.
    (g) If the licensee fails to qualify for a credit to the license 
within 95 days of the date of production of polyhydric alcohols in a 
quantity sufficient to offset the charge to the license for the imported 
sugar used for producing such polyhydric alcohols, or if such a credit 
initially granted is subsequently revoked, payment will be made to the 
United States of America under the bond of a monetary amount equal to 
the difference between the Number 11 contract price and the Number 14 
contract price, per pound of raw sugar, in effect on the last market day 
before the date of entry of the sugar or the last market day before the 
end of the period during which production of polyhydric alcohol was 
required, whichever difference is greater, times the quantity of raw 
sugar that should have been, but was not, used in the production of 
polyhydric alcohol in timely

[[Page 685]]

compliance with the requirements of this subpart. In the event no Number 
11 contract price or Number 14 contract price is reported by the New 
York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, for the relevant market day, the 
Licensing Authority may estimate such price as he or she deems 
appropriate.
    (h) Within 10 business days of the date of issuance of a license, 
the licensee shall submit to the Licensing Authority a copy of the 
performance bond.

Sec. 1530.309  Enforcement.

    (a) If at any time after receiving the proof of production of 
polyhydric alcohol described in Sec. 1530.305 of this subpart, the 
Licensing Authority determines that the sugar entered under the license 
was not used for the sole purpose of producing (other than by 
distillation) polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use as 
a substitute for sugar in human food consumption, and if the bond has 
been released under Sec. 1530.303, the Licensing Authority may hold the 
licensee liable for the difference between the Number 11 contract price 
and the Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, in effect on 
the last market day before the date of entry of the sugar or the last 
market day before the end of the period during which production of 
polyhydric alcohol was required, whichever difference is greater, times

[[Page 688]]

the quantity of sugar that should have been, but was not, used in such 
production of such polyhydric alcohol. In the event no Number 11 
contract price or Number 14 contract price is reported by the New York 
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, for the relevant market day, the 
Licensing Authority may estimate such price as he or she deems 
appropriate.
    (b) If at any time after receiving the licensee's certification that 
no refund, as drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any 
sugars, syrups or molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 
1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 
2106.90.12 of the HTS has been or will be claimed or received on the 
basis, or as a result, of the exportation of any polyhydric alcohol, the 
Licensing Authority determines that a refund of such customs duties has 
been claimed or received by the licensee or any other person, and if the 
bond has been released under Sec. 1530.303, the Licensing Authority may 
hold the licensee liable for the difference between the Number 11 
contract price and the Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, 
in effect on the last market day before the date of entry of the sugar 
or the last market day before the end of the period during which export 
was required, whichever difference is greater, times the quantity of 
sugar used in the production of such polyhydric alcohol. In the event no 
Number 11 contract price or Number 14 contract price is reported by the 
New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange for the relevant market day, 
the Licensing Authority may estimate such price as he or she deems 
appropriate.
    (c) If at any time the Licensing Authority determines that a 
licensee has failed to comply with the requirements of this subpart, 
including the requirement of HTS subheading 1701.11.02 and of the

Sec. 1550.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part sets forth policies and requirements with respect to 
the conduct by the FAS of programs utilizing public or private entities 
in the United States to help develop foreign markets for United States 
agricultural commodities on a mutually benefiting basis. As far as 
practicable, FAS relies upon representatives of the private U.S. 
agricultural sector to carry out market development activities through 
cooperative agreements.
    (b) These activities include entering into contracts pursuant to 
which FAS procures, for a stated consideration, property and services 
needed in developing markets for U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R05>
Sec. 1550.2  Definitions.

    (a) Agricultural commodities includes agricultural commodities and 
products thereof.
    (b) Affiliate or affiliated organization means any partnership, 
association, company, corporation, trust, or any other legal entity in 
which the program participant has any investment other than an 
investment in any mutual fund.
    (c) Cooperator means an entity entering into a Market Development 
Project Agreement.
    (d) Export Incentive Program Agreements mean cooperative agreements 
between FAS and a private United States entity for the purpose of 
maintaining, expanding or creating foreign markets for United States 
agricultural commodities through the promotion of brand-identified 
agricultural commodities.
    (e) FAS means the Foreign Agricultural Service of the United States 
Department of Agriculture.
    (f) Incentive payment means FAS reimbursement for eligible promotion 
costs incurred under the terms of an Export Incentive Program Agreement.
    (g) Market Development Project Agreements mean cooperative 
agreements between FAS and United States agricultural trade associations 
or associations of State Departments of Agriculture for the purpose of 
maximizing sales in foreign markets of U.S. agricultural commodities. 
Activities to be undertaken are intended to promote specific commodities 
on a generic or brand-identified basis, or through programs which 
include both elements.
    (h) Participant or program participant means any entity entering 
into an agreement within the scope of this part 1550.

<R05>
Sec. 1550.3  Market Development Project Agreements.

    (a) Eligible Organizations. In selecting trade and Agricultural 
groups as cooperators, representative nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade 
organizations will be used to the maximum extent

[[Page 695]]

possible. Organizations selected should represent the commodity being 
promoted on the broadest possible basis, with priority given to those 
which are industry-wide or nationwide in membership and scope. 
Cooperators must demonstrate an ability to provide U.S.-based staff 
capable of developing, supervising, and carrying out projects overseas, 
and be willing and able to contribute resources to a joint project.
    (b) Use of Third Parties. A Cooperator that enters into a Market 
Development Project Agreement may undertake market development 
activities directly or through a third party provided that such 
Cooperator remains responsible for the activities of the third party.
    (c) Contributions. Cooperators are expected to contribute funds or 
make in-kind contributions towards completion of approved market 
development projects. Contributions by third parties will be accepted as 
partially satisfying the contribution obligation of the Cooperator.
    (d) Project Funds. FAS will make funds available, up to the amount 
stated in the Market Development Project Agreement, to reimburse 
Cooperators for expenditures incurred in conducting activities 
authorized by the agreement and budgeted in a marketing plan approved in 
advance by FAS. Funds will be paid in United States dollars unless the 
Cooperator and FAS specifically agree that payment will be made in 
foreign currencies.
    (e) Consideration of Projects. Market Development Project Agreements 
will be entered into by FAS only if it is determined that such 
agreements could contribute to the effective creation, expansion, or 
maintenance of foreign markets for U.S. agricultural commodities based 
on available supplies of those commodities for export and international 
market conditions. Marketing plans will be required from organizations 
selected to participate in Market Development Project Agreements and 
will serve as a basis for the expenditure of funds committed to Market 
Development Project Agreements. Marketing plans will be reviewed 
according to the following criteria:
    (1) The market potential for the commodities covered in the markets 
identified for promotional effort and the identification of conditions 
affecting the level of U.S. exports which could be influenced by the 
projects proposed;
    (2) The extent and complexity of activities proposed in relation to 
each Cooperator's prior export market development experience and U.S.-
based staff resources;
    (3) The likelihood of these activities influencing conditions 
affecting the level of U.S. exports.


<R05>
Sec. 1550.4  Export Incentive Program Agreements.

    (a) Eligible Organizations. Export Incentive Program (EIP) 
agreements will be entered into with private U.S. entities.
    (b) Use of Third Parties. An entity that enters into an Export 
Incentive Program Agreement may undertake market development activities 
directly or through a third party provided such entity remains 
responsible for the activity.
    (c) Reimbursement. After submission of a claim for an incentive 
payment, FAS will reimburse a percentage of eligible promotion costs 
defined in the Export Incentive Program Agreement, up to the amount 
stated in the Agreement, to carry out the purposes of the project. Such 
a claim will be submitted on a marketing year basis or at such other 
time as may be agreed by FAS. The amount of funds to be paid by FAS on 
each claim will be specified in the Agreement and will be based upon 
either a stated percentage of the promotional expenditures claimed, 
volume of exports over a stated period, or a combination of both. Funds 
will be paid in U.S. dollars only.
    (d) Consideration of Projects. Export Incentive Program Agreements 
will be entered into by FAS only if it is determined that such 
agreements with private firms could contribute to the effective 
creation, expansion, or maintenance of foreign markets for the 
commodities concerned. Project proposals will be reviewed in relation to 
market conditions in the countries where activities are proposed, and in

<R05>
Sec. 1550.5  Program participation and benefits.

    (a) Scope. This section establishes requirements applicable only to 
participation in Market Development Project Agreements and any other 
agreement with FAS that specifically incorporates the provisions of this 
part.
    (b) General. It is the policy of FAS to insure that the benefits 
generated by agreements are as broadly distributed throughout the 
relevant agricultural sector as feasible and, particularly, that no 
program participant derive an unfair advantage or benefit from 
activities conducted pursuant to the agreement, whether funded with 
project funds or industry contributions.
    (c) Industry Participation. When required by FAS, program 
participants shall promptly furnish to FAS for approval its criteria for 
the selection of U.S. agricultural industry representatives to 
participate in activities conducted pursuant to the agreement such as 
trade teams, sales teams, and trade fairs, and its criteria for the 
selection of firms to participate in U.S. brand-identified promotions. 
Such criteria must ensure participation on an equitable basis by a 
representative cross section of the relevant U.S. agricultural industry. 
If FAS requests submission of criteria for approval, the program 
participant shall not use criteria disapproved by FAS after the program 
participant has been notified of FAS's disapproval.
    (d) Distribution of Information. All program participants shall 
provide, on a timely basis, upon request of any entity in the United 
States, other than a representative of a foreign government, any and all 
data developed and produced with project funds or contributions. Any fee 
charged in connection therewith may not exceed the costs incurred in 
assembling, duplicating and distributing the requested material.
    (e) Export Activities and Related Services. (1) Neither program 
participants nor their affiliated organizations shall, during the term 
of the agreement, make export sales of agricultural commodities of the 
kind which are promoted, in whole or in part, with project funds.
    (2) Neither the program participants nor affiliated organizations 
may assess fees for services provided to exporters in facilitating an 
export sale if the promotional activities intended to directly result in 
that specific export sale are supported, in whole or in part, by project 
funds. This paragraph applies to activities such as those involving 
discussions with potential buyers or the solicitation of specific sales 
including activities performed by sales teams and performed through 
trade fairs rather than activities of a more general promotional nature. 
This paragraph does not apply to checkoffs or membership dues based on 
commodity sales, when such assessments are a condition of membership in 
the participating organization.
    (3) Participants in approved program activities shall not use the 
activities to promote private self-interests or conduct private 
business, except as members of sales teams or as part of a U.S. brand-
identified promotion when such activities are specifically approved by 
FAS.


<R05>
Sec. 1550.6  Compliance with program requirements.

    (a) Within 30 days after the effective date of these regulations, 
program participants shall submit a written statement to the 
Administrator, FAS, that neither they, nor their affiliated 
organizations, will make export sales of agricultural commodities 
promoted, in whole or in part, with project funds during the term of any 
agreement between the program participant and FAS within the scope of 
Sec. 1550.5. FAS may from time to time require program participants to 
submit certifications as to export sales for purposes of this part.
    (b) In the event of noncompliance with any provision of these 
regulations, FAS may disallow a claim submitted under an agreement for 
expenses incurred after the effective date of these regulations or 
terminate the agreement in addition to any other remedy available to 
FAS.

   Subpart A--Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program and Cottonseed Oil 
                       Assistance Program Criteria

    Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5663.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.10  General statement.

    This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating 
and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under 
the Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program (SOAP) and Cottonseed Oil 
Assistance Program (COAP) administered by the Foreign Agricultural 
Service (FAS). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered 
together in order to select eligible countries for SOAP and COAP 
initiatives which will best meet the programs' objective. The objective 
of the programs is to encourage the sale of additional quantities of 
sunflowerseed oil and cottonseed oil in world markets at competitive 
prices. Under the SOAP and the COAP, bonuses are made available by FAS 
to enable exporters to meet prevailing world prices for sunflowerseed 
oil and cottonseed oil in targeted destinations. In the operation of the 
SOAP and the COAP, FAS will make reasonable efforts to avoid the 
displacement of usual marketings of U.S. agricultural commodities.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.20  Criteria.

    The criteria considered by FAS in reviewing proposals for SOAP and 
COAP initiatives will include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) The expected contribution which initiatives will make toward 
realizing U.S. agricultural export goals and, in particular, in 
developing, expanding, or maintaining markets for U.S. sunflowerseed 
and/or cottonseed oil;
    (b) The subsidy requirements of proposed initiatives in relation to 
the sums made available to operate the programs in any given fiscal 
year; and
    (c) The likelihood that sales facilitated by initiatives would have 
the unintended effect of displacing normal commercial sales of 
sunflowerseed and/or cottonseed oil.


<R04>
             Subpart B--SOAP and COAP Drawback Certification

    Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5676.


<R05>
Sec. 1570.1100  Drawback certification.

    An offer submitted by an exporter to FAS for an export bonus under 
the SOAP or the COAP must contain, in addition to any other information 
required by FAS, a certification stating the following: ``None of the 
eligible commodity (sunflowerseed oil and/or cottonseed oil) has been or 
will be used as the basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant 
to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1313) of any duty, 
tax, or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or 
product.'' This certification must be signed by the exporter, if the 
exporter is an individual, or by a partner or officer of the exporter, 
if the exporter is a partnership or a corporation, respectively. FAS 
will reject any offer that does not contain the prescribed 
certification.
