                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

PART 2--TESTIMONY BY EMPLOYEES AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS IN PROCEEDINGS 
WHERE THE UNITED STATES IS NOT A PARTY--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
2.1 Scope, purpose, and applicability.
2.2 Definitions.
2.3 Policy on presentation of testimony and production of documents.
2.4 Procedures when voluntary testimony is requested or when an employee 
          is subpoenaed.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301, 5 U.S.C. 552.

    Source: 52 FR 37146, Oct. 5, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1  Scope, purpose, and applicability.

    (a) This part sets forth rules to be followed when an employee or 
former employee of the Department of Health and Human Services (``DHHS'' 
or ``Department''), other than an employee of the Food and Drug 
Administration, is requested or subpoenaed to provide testimony in a 
deposition, trial, or other similar proceeding concerning information 
acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of such 
person's official capacity with DHHS. This part also sets forth 
procedures for the handling of subpoenas duces tecum and other requests 
for any document in the possession of DHHS, other than the Food and Drug 
Administration, and for the processing of requests for certification of 
copies of documents. Separate regulations, 21 CFR part 20, govern the 
Food and Drug Administration, and those regulations are not affected by 
this part.
    (b) It is the policy of the DHHS to provide information, data, and 
records to non-federal litigants to the same extent and in the same 
manner that they

[[Page 8]]

are made available to the general public and, when subject to the 
jurisdiction of a court or other tribunal presiding over non-federal 
party litigation, to follow all applicable procedural and substantive 
rules relating to the production of information, data, and records by a 
non-party. The availability of Department employees to testify in 
litigation not involving federal parties is governed by the Department's 
policy to maintain strict impartiality with respect to private litigants 
and to minimize the disruption of official duties.
    (c) This part applies to state, local and tribal judicial, 
administrative, and legislative proceedings, and to federal judicial and 
administrative proceedings.
    (d) This part does not apply to:
    (1) Any civil or criminal proceedings where the United States, the 
Department of Health and Human Services, and any agency thereof, or any 
other Federal agency is a party.
    (2) Congressional requests or subpoenas for testimony or documents.
    (3) Consultative services and technical assistance provided by the 
Department of Health and Human Services, or any agency thereof, in 
carrying out its normal program activities.
    (4) Employees serving as expert witnesses in connection with 
professional and consultative services as approved outside activities in 
accordance with 5 CFR 2635.805 and 5 CFR 5501.106. (In cases where 
employees are providing such outside services, they must state for the 
record that the testimony represents their own views and does not 
necessarily represent the official position of the DHHS.)
    (5) Employees making appearances in their private capacity in legal 
or administrative proceedings that do not relate to the Department of 
Health and Human Services (such as cases arising out of traffic 
accidents, crimes, domestic relations, etc.) and not involving 
professional and consultative services.
    (6) Any matters covered in 21 CFR part 20-,involving the Food and 
Drug Administration.
    (7) Any civil or criminal proceedings in State court brought on 
behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services.

    Example (1): While on duty, an employee of the Department witnesses 
an incident in which a fellow employee trips on a loose piece of 
carpeting and sustains an injury. The injured employee brings a private 
tort action against the contractor installing the carpeting and the 
private landlord maintaining the building. The employee/witness is 
served with a subpoena to appear at a deposition to testify about the 
incident. The person seeking the testimony would not be required to 
obtain Agency head approval prior to requesting the testimony, because 
the subject of the testimony does not ``relate to'' the Department, 
within the meaning of Sec. 2.1(d)(5).
    Example (2): While on duty, an employee of the Department witnesses 
a mugging while looking out the window to check the weather, and then 
notifies the local police of what she observed. She is subsequently 
subpoenaed to testify in a criminal proceeding. The local prosecutor 
would not be required to obtain Agency head approval prior to requiring 
the employee to testify, because the subject of the testimony does not 
``relate to'' the Department, within the meaning of Sec. 2.1(d)(5).
    Example (3): A nurse on duty at an Indian Health Service hospital 
emergency room treats a child who is brought in following a report of 
domestic violence. The nurse is subsequently served with a subpoena to 
testify in a criminal proceeding against one of the child's parents 
concerning the injuries to the child which he observed. The local 
prosecutor would be required to obtain Agency head approval prior to 
requiring the nurse to testify, because the subject of the testimony 
involves ``information acquired in the course of performing official 
duties or because of the person's official capacity,'' within the 
meaning of Sec. 2.1(a).
    Example (4): A personnel specialist working for the Department is 
subpoenaed to testify concerning the meaning of entries on time and 
attendance records of an employee, which the requesting party received 
from the employee pursuant to discovery in a personal injury action 
brought by the employee. The party requesting the personnel specialist 
to appear would be required to obtain Agency head approval prior to 
compelling the personnel specialist to testify, because the testimony 
sought involves ``information acquired in the course of performing 
official duties or because of the person's official capacity,'' within 
the meaning of Sec. 2.1(a).
    Example (5): A National Institutes of Health physician is subpoenaed 
in a private medical malpractice action to provide expert testimony in 
her specialty. The party requesting her testimony would be required to 
obtain Agency head approval prior to her testifying in response to the 
subpoena, because the expert testimony sought involves

[[Page 9]]

``information acquired in the course of performing official duties or 
because of the person's official capacity,'' within the meaning of Sec. 
2.1(a).

1816 and 1842 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395h, 1395u; and
    (3) Current and former employees and contractors of entities covered 
under the Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act of 1992, as 
amended, 42 U.S.C Sec. 233 (FSHCAA), provided that the requested

    No employee or former employee of the DHHS may provide testimony or 
produce documents in any proceedings to which this part applies 
concerning information acquired in the course of performing official 
duties or because of the person's official relationship with the 
Department unless authorized by the Agency head pursuant to this part 
based on a determination by the Agency head, after consultation with the 
Office of the General Counsel, that compliance with the request would 
promote the objectives of the Department.

[68 FR 25839, May 14, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 2.4  Procedures when voluntary testimony is requested or when an employee 
is subpoenaed.

    (a) All requests for testimony by an employee or former employee of 
the DHHS in his or her official capacity and not subject to the 
exceptions set forth in Sec. 2.1(d) of this part must be addressed to 
the Agency head in writing and must state the nature of the requested 
testimony, why the information sought is unavailable by any other means, 
and the reasons why the testimony would be in the interest of the DHHS 
or the federal government.
    (b) If the Agency head denies approval to comply with a subpoena for 
testimony, or if the Agency head has

[[Page 10]]

not acted by the return date, the employee will be directed to appear at 
the stated time and place, unless advised by the Office of the General 
Counsel that responding to the subpoena would be inappropriate (in such 
circumstances as, for example, an instance where the subpoena was not 
validly issued or served, where the subpoena has been withdrawn, or 
where discovery has been stayed), produce a copy of these regulations, 
and respectfully decline to testify or produce any documents on the 
basis of these regulations.

[68 FR 25840, May 14, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 2.5  Subpoenas duces tecum.

    (a) Whenever a subpoena duces tecum has been served upon a DHHS 
employee or former employee commanding the production of any record, 
such person shall refer the subpoena to the Office of the General 
Counsel (including regional chief counsels) for a determination of the 
legal sufficiency of the subpoena, whether the subpoena was properly 
served, and whether the issuing court or other tribunal has jurisdiction 
over the Department.) If the General Counsel or his designee determines 
that the subpoena is legally sufficient, the subpoena was properly 
served, and the tribunal has jurisdiction, the terms of the subpoena 
shall be complied with unless affirmative action is taken by the 
Department to modify or quash the subpoena in accordance with Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 45 (c).
    (b) If a subpoena duces tecum served upon a DHHS employee or former 
employee commanding the production of any record is determined by the 
Office of the General Counsel to be legally insufficient, improperly 
served, or from a tribunal not having jurisdiction, such subpoena shall 
be deemed a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act and 
shall be handled pursuant to the rules governing public disclosure 
established in 45 CFR part 5.

[68 FR 25840, May 14, 2003]


<R05>

only in designated areas or as approved by the Director.
    (b) Pets and other animals. A person may not bring on the enclave 
any cat, dog, or other animal except for authorized purposes. This

appropriate signs. Photographs and similar activities for advertising or 
commercial purposes may be taken only with the advance written approval 
of the Director. A person may take photographs of a patient only with 
the informed consent of the patient (or the natural or legal guardian) 
and of the Director of the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center or 
delegate.
    (d) Intoxicating beverages, narcotics, and other controlled 
substances. A person may not possess, sell, consume, or use alcohol or 
other intoxicating beverages, except in connection with official duties, 
as part of authorized research, or as otherwise authorized by the 
Director, or, in the case of possession, consumption or use only, in 
living quarters. (The sale, consumption, use, or possession of narcotics 
and other controlled substances is prohibited and shall be governed by 
the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841-845); driving under the

specifically authorized police officer shall possess firearms, 
explosives, or other dangerous or deadly weapons or dangerous materials 
intended to be used as weapons either openly or concealed. Upon written 
request, the Director may permit possession in living quarters of 
antique firearms held for collection purposes, if the Director finds 
that the collection does not present any risk of harm.

<R05>
Sec. 3.43  Removal of property.

    A person may not remove Federal property from the enclave or any 
building on the enclave without a property pass, signed by an authorized 
property custodian, which specifically describes the items to be 
removed. In an emergency, or when the property custodian is not 
available, a police officer may approve removal of Federal property if, 
after consulting with the administrative officer or other appropriate 
official, the police officer is authorized by the official to do so. 
Privately-owned property, other than that ordinarily carried on one's 
person, may be removed only under this property pass procedure, or upon 
properly establishing ownership of the property to a police officer.
    Packages, briefcases, or other containers brought within the enclave

Director, to offer or display any article or service for sale within the 
enclave buildings or grounds; or to display any sign, placard, or other 
form of advertisement; or to collect private debts; or to solicit 
business, alms, subscriptions or contributions, except in connection 
with approved national or local campaigns for funds for welfare, health 
and other public interest purposes, or solicitation of labor 
organization membership or dues as authorized under the Civil Service 
Reform Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-454).
    This provision shall not apply to authorized lessees and their 
agents and employees with regard to space leased for commercial, 
cultural, educational, or recreational purposes, under the Public 
Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (40 U.S.C. 490(A)(16)).

<R04>
                         Subpart A--Basic Policy


<R05>
Sec. 5.1  Purpose.

    This part contains the rules that the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) follows in handling requests for records under the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It describes how to make a FOIA 
request; who can release records and who can decide not to release; how 
much time it should take to make a determination regarding release; what 
fees may be charged;

[[Page 18]]

what records are available for public inspection; why some records are 
not released; and your right to appeal and then go to court if we refuse 
to release records.


<R05>
Sec. 5.2  Policy.

    As a general policy, HHS follows a balanced approach in 
administering FOIA. We not only recognize the right of public access to 
information in the possession of the Department, but also protect the 
integrity of internal processes. In addition, we recognize the 
legitimate interests of organizations or persons who have submitted 
records to the Department or who would otherwise be affected by release 
of records. For example, we have no discretion to release certain 
records, such as trade secrets and confidential commercial information, 
prohibited from release by law. This policy calls for the fullest 
responsible disclosure consistent with those requirements of 
administrative necessity and confidentiality which are recognized in the 
Freedom of Information Act.


<R05>
Sec. 5.3  Scope.

    These rules apply to all components of the Department. Some units 
may establish additional rules because of unique program requirements, 
but such rules must be consistent with these rules and must have the 
concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Existing 
implementing rules remain in effect to the extent that they are 
consistent with the new Departmental regulation. If additional rules are 
issued, they will be published in the Federal Register, and you may get 
copies from our Freedom of information Officers.


<R05>
Sec. 5.4  Relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974.

    (a) Coverage. The FOIA and this rule apply to all HHS records. The 
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about 
individuals, but only if the records are in a system of records. 
``Individuals'' and ``system of records'' are defined in the Privacy Act 
and in our Privacy Act regulation, part 5b of this title.
    (b) Requesting your own records. If you are an individual and 
request records, then to the extent you are requesting your own records 
in a system of records, we will handle your request under the Privacy 
Act and part 5b. If there is any record that we need not release to you 
under those provisions, we will also consider your request under the 
FOIA and this rule, and we will release the record to you if the FOIA 
requires it.
    (c) Requesting another individual's record. Whether or not you are 
an individual, if you request records that are about an individual 
(other than yourself) and that are in a system of records, we will 
handle your request under the FOIA and this rule. (However, if our 
disclosure in response to your request would be permitted by the Privacy 
Act's disclosure provision, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), for reasons other than the 
requirements of the FOIA, and if we decide to make the disclosure, then 
we will not handle your request under the FOIA and this rule. For 
example, when we make routine use disclosures pursuant to requests, we 
do not handle them under the FOIA and this rule. ``Routine use'' is 
defined in the Privacy Act and in Part 5b). If we handle your request 
under the FOIA and this rule and the FOIA does not require releasing the 
record to you, then the Privacy Act may prohibit the release and remove 
our discretion to release.


<R05>
Sec. 5.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part,
    Agency means any executive department, military department, 
government corporation, government controlled corporation, or other 
establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government, or any 
independent regulatory agency. Thus, HHS is an agency. A private 
organization is not an agency even if it is performing work under 
contract with the Government or is receiving Federal financial 
assistance. Grantee and contractor records are not subject to the FOIA 
unless they are in the possession or under the control of HHS or its 
agents, such as Medicare health insurance carriers and intermediaries.
    Commercial use means, when referring to a request, that the request 
is from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose 
that furthers

[[Page 19]]

the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a 
person on whose behalf the request is made. Whether a request is for a 
commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the use to 
which the records will be put; the identity of the requester 
(individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), on the 
nature of the records, while in some cases indicative of that purpose or 
use, is not necessarily determinative. When a request is from a 
representative of the news media, a purpose or use supporting the 
requester's news dissemination function is not a commercial use.
    Department or HHS means the Department of Health and Human Services. 
It includes Medicare health insurance carriers and intermediaries to the 
extent they are performing functions under agreements entered into under 
sections 1816 and 1842 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395h, 
1395u.
    Duplication means the process of making a copy of a record and 
sending it to the requester, to the extent necessary to respond to the 
request. Such copies include paper copy, microform, audio-visual 
materials, and magnetic tapes, cards, and discs.
    Educational institution means a preschool, elementary or secondary 
school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or 
institution of professional or vocational education, which operates a 
program of scholarly research.
    Freedom of Information Act or FOIA means section 552 of Title 5, 
United States Code, as amended.
    Freedom of Information Officer means an HHS official who has been 
delegated the authority to release or withhold records and assess, 
waive, or reduce fees in response to FOIA requests.
    Non-commercial scientific institution means an institution that is 
not operated substantially for purposes of furthering its own or someone 
else's business, trade, or profit interests, and that is operated for 
purposes of conducting scientific research whose results are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    Records means any handwritten, typed, or printed documents (such as 
memoranda, books, brochures, studies, writings, drafts, letters, 
transcripts, and minutes) and documentary material in other forms (such 
as punchcards; magnetic tapes, cards, or discs; paper tapes; audio or 
video recordings; maps; photographs; slides; microfilm; and motion 
pictures). It does not include objects or articles such as exhibits, 
models, equipment, and duplication machines or audiovisual processing 
materials. Nor does it include books, magazines, pamphlets, or other 
reference material in formally organized and officially designated HHS 
libraries, where such materials are available under the rules of the 
particular library.
    Representative of the news media means a person actively gathering 
information for an entity organized and operated to publish or broadcast 
news to the public. News media entities include television and radio 
broadcasters, publishers of periodicals who distribute their products to 
the general public or who make their products available for purchase or 
subscription by the general public, and entities that may disseminate 
news through other media (e.g., electronic dissemination of text). We 
will treat freelance journalists as representatives of a new media 
entity if they can show a likelihood of publication through such an 
entity. A publication contract is such a basis, and the requester's past 
publication record may show such a basis.
    Request means asking for records, whether or not you refer 
specifically to the Freedom of Information Act. Requests from Federal 
agencies and court orders for documents are not included within this 
definition. Subpoenas are requests only to the extent provided by Part 2 
of this title.
    Review means, when used in connection with processing records for a 
commercial use request, examining the records to determine what 
portions, if any, may be withheld, and any other processing that is 
necessary to prepare the records for release. It includes only the 
examining and processing that are done the first time we analyze whether 
a specific exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a 
record. It does not include examination done in the appeal stage with 
respect to an exemption that was applied at the initial request stage. 
However, if we initially

[[Page 20]]

withhold a record under one exemption, and on appeal we determine that 
that exemption does not apply, then examining the record in the appeal 
stage for the purpose of determining whether a different exemption 
applies is included in review. It does not include the process of 
researching or resolving general legal or policy issues regarding 
exemptions.
    Search means looking for records or portions of records responsive 
to a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request, and also 
page-by-page and line-by-line examination to identify responsive 
portions of a document. However, it does not include line-by-line 
examination where merely duplicating the entire page would be a less 
expensive and quicker way to comply with the request.


<R04>
                      Subpart B--Obtaining a Record


<R05>
Sec. 5.21  How to request records.

    (a) General. Our policy is to answer all requests, both oral and 
written, for records. However, in order to have the rights given you by 
the FOIA and by this regulation (for example, the right to appeal if we 
deny your request and the right to have our decisions reviewed in 
court), you must either make your request in writing or make it orally 
to a Freedom of Information Officer. Freedom of Information Officers and 
their staffs may put in writing any oral requests they receive directly.
    (b) Addressing requests. It will help us to handle your request 
sooner if you address it to the Freedom of Information Officer in the 
HHS unit that is most likely to have the records you want. (See Sec. 
5.31 of this Part for a list of Freedom of Information Officers.) If you 
cannot determine this, send the request to: HHS Freedom of Information 
Officer, 645-F, Hubert H. Humphrey Building, Department of Health and 
Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20201. Write 
the words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' on the envelope and 
letter.
    (c) Details in the letter. You should provide details that will help 
us identify and find the records you are requesting. If there is 
insufficient information, we will ask you for more. Include your 
telephone number(s) to help us reach you if we have questions. If you 
are not sure how to write your request or what details to include, 
communicate with a Freedom of Information Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 5.22  Requests not handled under the FOIA.

    (a) We will not handle your request under the FOIA and this 
regulation to the extent it asks for records that are currently 
available, either from HHS or from another part of the Federal 
Government, under a statute that provides for charging fees for those 
records. For example, we will not handle your request under the FOIA and 
this regulation to the extent it asks for detailed earnings statements 
under the Social Security program, or records currently available from 
the Government Printing Office of the National Technical Information 
Service.
    (b) We will not handle your request under the FOIA and this 
regulation to the extent it asks for records that are distributed by an 
HHS program office as part of its regular program activity, for example, 
health education brochures distributed by the Public Health Service or 
public information leaflets distributed by the Social Security 
Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 5.23  Referral of requests outside the Department.

    If you request records that were created by, or provided to us by, 
another Federal agency, and if that agency asserts control over the 
records, we may refer the records and your request to that agency. We 
may likewise refer requests for classified records to the agency that 
classified them. In these cases, the other agency will process and 
respond to your request, to the extent it concerns those records, under 
that agency's regulation, and you need not make a separate request to 
that agency. We will notify you when we refer your request to another 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 5.24  Responding to your request.

    (a) Retrieving records. The Department is required to furnish copies 
of records only when they are in our possession or we can retrieve them 
from storage. If we have stored the records

[[Page 21]]

you want in the National Archives or another storage center, we will 
retrieve and review them for possible disclosure. However, the Federal 
Government destroys many old records, so sometimes it is impossible to 
fill requests. Various laws, regulations, and manuals give the time 
periods for keeping records before they may be destroyed. For example, 
there is information about retention of records in the Records Disposal 
Act of 1944, 44 U.S.C. 3301 through 3314; the Federal Property 
Management Regulations, 41 CFR 101-11.4; the General Records Schedules 
of the National Archives and Records Administration; and in the HHS 
Handbook: Files Maintenance and Records Disposition.
    (b) Furnishing records. The requirement is that we furnish copies 
only of records that we have or can retrieve. We are not compelled to 
create new records. For example, we are not required to write a new 
program so that a computer will print information in the format you 
prefer. However, if the requested information is maintained in 
computerized form, but we can, with minimal computer instructions, 
produce the information on paper, we will do this if it is the only way 
to respond to a request. Nor are we required to perform research for 
you. On the other hand, we may decide to conserve government resources 
and at the same time supply the records you need by consolidating 
information from various records rather than copying them all. Moreover, 
we are required to furnish only one copy of a record and usually impose 
that limit. If information exists in different forms, we will provide 
the record in the form that best conserves government resources. For 
example, if it requires less time and expense to provide a computer 
record as a paper printout rather than in an electronic medium, we will 
provide the printout.


<R04>
                Subpart C--Release and Denial of Records


<R05>
Sec. 5.31  Designation of authorized officials.

    (a) Freedom of Information Officers. To provide coordination and 
consistency in responding to FOIA requests, only Freedom of Information 
Officers have the authority to release or deny records. These same 
officials determine fees.
    (1) HHS Freedom of Information Officer. Only the HHS Freedom of 
Information Officer may determine whether to release or deny records in 
any of the following situations:
    (i) The records you seek include records addressed to or sent from

    (iii) The records include records of more than one of the major 
units identified below (PHS, CMS, and SSA) either at headquarters or in 
a Regional Office.
    (2) PHS Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you seek are 
exclusively records of the Public Health Service or if the records you 
seek involve more than one health agency of the Public Health Service, 
including its records in the regions, only the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Health (Communications), who also is the PHS Freedom of 
Information Officer, may determine whether to release or deny the 
records, except as follows:
    (i) CDC and ATSDR Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you 
seek are exclusively records of the Centers for Disease Control and/or 
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, only the Director, 
Office of Public Affairs, CDC, who also is the CDC and ATSDR Freedom of 
Information Officer, may determine whether to release or deny the 
records.
    (ii) FDA Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you seek are 
exclusively records of the Food and Drug Administration, only the 
Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs, FDA, who also is the FDA 
Freedom of Information Officer, may determine whether to release or deny 
the records.
    (iii) NIH Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you seek 
are exclusively records of the National Institutes of Health, only the 
Associate Director of Communications, HIH, who

[[Page 22]]

also is the NIH Freedom of Information Officer, may determine whether to 
release or deny the records.
    (iv) HRSA Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you seek

Officer, may determine whether to release or deny the records.
    (vi) IHS Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you seek are 
exclusively records of the Indian Health Service, only the Director of 
Communications, IHS, who also is the IHS Freedom of Information Officer, 
may determine whether to release or deny the records.
    (3) SSA Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you seek are 
exclusively records of the Social Security Administration, including its 
records in the regions, only the Director, Office of Public Inquiries, 
SSA, who also is the SSA Freedom of Information Officer, may determine 
whether to release or deny the records.
    (4) CMS Freedom of Information Officer. If the records you seek are 
exclusively records of theCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 
including its records in the regions, only the Director, Office of 
Public Affairs, CMS, who also is the CMS Freedom of Information Officer, 
may determine whether to release or deny the records.
    (b) Delegations. Any of the above Freedom of Information Officers 
may delegate his or her authority to release or deny records and to 
determine fees. Any such delegation requires the concurrence of the 
Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.
    (c) Addresses and telephone numbers. The addresses and telephone

<R05>
Sec. 5.32  Release of records.

    (a) Records previously released. If we have released a record, or a 
part of a record, to others in the past, we will ordinarily release it 
to you also. However, we will not release it to you if a statute forbids 
this disclosure, and we will not necessarily release it to you if an 
exemption applies in your situation and did not apply, or applied 
differently, in the previous situations.
    (b) Unauthorized disclosure. The principle stated in paragraph (a) 
of this section, does not apply if the previous release was 
unauthorized.
    (c) Poor copy. If we cannot make a legible copy of a record to be 
released, we do not attempt to reconstruct it. Instead, we furnish the 
best copy possible and note its poor quality in our reply.

[[Page 23]]


<R05>
Sec. 5.33  Denial of requests.

    (a) Information furnished. All denials are in writing and describe 
in general terms the material withheld; state the reasons for the 
denial, including, as applicable, a reference to the specific exemption 
of the FOIA authorizing the withholding or deletion; explain your right 
to appeal the decision and identify the official to whom you should send 
the appeal; and are signed by the person who made the decision to deny 
all or part of the request.
    (b) Unproductive searches. We make a diligent search for records to 
satisfy your request. Nevertheless, we may not be able always to find 
the records you want using the information you provided, or they may not 
exist. If we advise you that we have been unable to find the records 
despite a diligent search, this does not constitute a denial of your 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 5.34  Appeal of denials.

    (a) Right of appeal. You have the right to appeal a partial or full 
denial of your FOIA request. To do so, you must put your appeal in 
writing and send it to the review official identified in the denial 
letter. You must send your appeal within 30 days from the date you 
receive that letter or from the date you receive the records released as 
a partial grant of your request, whichever is later.
    (b) Letter of appeal. The appeal letter should state reasons why you 
believe that the FOIA exemption(s) we cited do not apply to the records 
that you requested, or give reasons why they should be released 
regardless of whether the exemption(s) apply. Because we have some 
discretionary authority in deciding whether to release or withhold 
records, you may strengthen your request by explaining your reasons for 
wanting the records. However, you are not required to give any 
explanation.
    (c) Review process. Before making a decision on an appeal of a 
denial, the designated review official will consult with the General 
Counsel to ensure that the rights and interests of all parties affected 
by the request are protected. Also, the concurrence of the Assistant 
Secretary for Public Affairs is required in all appeal decisions, 
including those on fees. When the review official responds to an appeal, 
that constitutes the Department's final action on the request. If the 
review official grants your appeal, we will send the records to you 
promptly or let you inspect them, or else we will explain the reason for 
any delay and the approximate date you will receive copies or be allowed 
to inspect the records. If the decision is to deny your appeal, the 
official will state the reasons for the decision in writing and inform 
you of the FOIA provision for judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 5.35  Time limits.

    (a) General. FOIA sets certain time limits for us to decide whether 
to disclose the records you requested, and to decide appeals. If we fail 
to meet the deadlines, you may proceed as if we had denied your request 
or your appeal. We will try diligently to comply with the time limits, 
but if it appears that processing your request may take longer than we 
would wish, we will acknowledge your request and tell you its status. 
Since requests may be misaddressed or misrouted, you should call or 
write to confirm that we have the request and to learn its status if you 
have not heard from us in a reasonable time.
    (b) Time allowed. (1) We will decide whether to release records 
within 10 working days after your request reaches the appropriate FOI 
office, as identified in Sec. 5.31 of this part. When we decide to 
release records, we will actually provide the records, or let you 
inspect them, as soon as possible after that decision.
    (2) We will decide an appeal within 20 working days after the appeal 
reaches the appropriate review official
    (c) Extension of time limits. FOI Officers of review officials may 
extend the time limits in unusual circumstances. Extension at the 
request stage and at the appeal stage may total up to 10 working days. 
We will notify you in writing of any extension. ``Unusual 
circumstances'' include situations when we:
    (1) Search for and collect records from field facilites, archives, 
or locations other than the office processing the request.

[[Page 24]]

    (2) Search for, collect, or examine a great many records in response 
to a single request.
    (3) Consult with another office or agency that has substantial 
interest in the determination of the request.
    (4) Conduct negotiations with submitters and requesters of 
information to determine the nature and extent of non-disclosable 
proprietary materials.


<R04>
                             Subpart D--Fees


<R05>
Sec. 5.41  Fees to be charged--categories of requests.

    The paragraphs below state, for each category of request, the type 
of fees that we will generally charge. However, for each of these 
categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons 
given in Sec.Sec. 5.42 through 5.45 or for other reasons.
    (a) Commercial use request. If your request is for a commercial use, 
HHS will charge you the costs of search, review, and duplication.
    (b) Educational and scientific institutions and news media. If you 
are an educational institution or a non-commercial scientific 
institution, operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or 
a representative of the news media, and your request is not for a 
commercial use, HHS will charge you only for the duplication of 
documents. Also, HHS will not charge you the copying costs for the first 
100 pages of duplication.
    (c) Other requesters. If your request is not the kind described by 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, then HHS will charge you only for 
the search and the duplication. Also, we will not charge you for the 
first two hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 
pages of duplication.


<R05>
Sec. 5.42  Fees to be charged--general provisions.

    (a) We may charge search fees even if the records we find are exempt 
from disclosure, or even if we do not find any records at all.
    (b) If we are not charging you for the first two hours of search 
time, under Sec. 5.41(c), and those two hours are spent on a computer 
search, then the two free hours are the first two hours of the 
operator's own operation. If the operator spends less than two hours on 
the search, we well reduce the total search fees by the average hourly 
rate for the operator's time, multipled by two.
    (c) If we are not charging you for the first 100 pages of 
duplication, under Sec. 5.41 (b) or (c), then those 100 pages are the 
first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 
pages of computer printout. If we cannot use this method to calculate 
the fee reduction, then we will reduce your total duplication fee by the 
normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100.
    (d) We will not charge you any fee at all if the costs of routine 
collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the 
amount of the fee. As of May 1987, such costs among the units HHS ranged 
between $6.00 and $12.50.
    (e) If we determine that you (acting either alone or together with 
others) are breaking down a single request into a series of requests in 
order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, we may aggregate all these 
requests for purposes of calculating the fees charged.
    (f) We will charge interest on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st 
day following the day the bill was sent. We will use the provisions of 
Part 30 of this Title in assessing interest, administrative costs, and 
penalties and in taking actions to encourage payment.
    (g) This subpart does not apply to requests for Social Security 
program records on Social Security number holders, wage earners, 
employers, and claimants, where the requests are governed by section 
1106 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306(c), and by 20 CFR 
442.441.


<R05>
Sec. 5.43  Fee schedule.

    HHS charges the following fees:
    (a) Manual searching for or reviewing of records--when the search or 
review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8, an hourly 
rate based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-
9 through GS-14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4, 
employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above, an hourly rate based on the 
salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will 
be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the

[[Page 25]]

specified grade and step, adding 16% of that rate to cover benefits, and 
rounding to the nearest whole dollar. As of November 25, 1988, these 
rates were $10, $20, and $37 respectively. When a search involves 
employees at more than one of these levels, we will charge the rate 
appropriate for each.
    (b) Computer searching and printing--the actual cost of operating 
the computer plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the 
rates given in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Photocopying standard size pages--$0.10 per page. FOI Officers 
may charge lower fees for particular documents where--
    (1) The document has already been printed in large numbers,
    (2) The program office determines that using existing stock to 
answer this request, and any other anticipated FOI requests, will not 
interfere with program requirements, and
    (3) The FOI Officer determines that the lower fee is adequate to 
recover the prorated share of the original printing costs.
    (d) Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or 
blueprints), or reproducing other records (such as tapes)--the actual 
costs of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the materials 
used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates 
given in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) Certifying that records are true copies. This service is not 
required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge $10 per 
certification.
    (f) Sending records by express mail, certified mail, or other 
special methods. This service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree 
to provide it, we will charge our actual costs.
    (g) Performing any other special service that you request and we 
agree to--actual costs of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of 
any materials used, plus charges for the time of our employees, at the 
rates given in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 5.44  Procedures for assessing and collecting fees.

    (a) Agreement to pay. We generally assume that when you request 
records you are willing to pay the fees we charge for services 
associated with your request. You may specify a limit on the amount you 
are willing to spend. We will notify you if it appears that the fees 
will exceed the limit and ask whether you nevertheless want us to 
proceed with the search.
    (b) Advance payment. If you have failed to pay previous bills in a 
timely fashion, or if our initial review of your request indicates that 
we will charge you fees exceeding $250, we will require you to pay your 
past due fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before we start 
searching for the records you want. If so, we will let you know promptly 
upon receiving your request. In such cases, the administrative time 
limits prescribed in Sec. 5.35 of the part (i.e., ten working days from 
receipt of initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appeals 
from initial denials, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) 
will begin only after we come to an agreement with you over payment of 
fees, or decide that fee waiver or reduction is appropriate.
    (c) Billing and payment. We will normally require you to pay all 
fees before we furnish the records to you. We may, at our discretion, 
send you a bill along with or following the furnishing of the records. 
For example, we may do this if you have a history of prompt payment. We 
may also, at our discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time 
periods in order to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent 
requesters, or to businesses or agents representing requesters. For 
example, we might send a bill to such a requester once a month. Fees 
should be paid in accordance with the instructions furnished by the 
person who responds to your requests.


<R05>
Sec. 5.45  Waiver or reduction of fees.

    (a) Standard. We will waive or reduce the fees we would otherwise 
charge if disclosure of the information meets both of the following 
tests:
    (1) It is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
the government, and
    (2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section.

[[Page 26]]

    (b) Public interest. The disclosure passes the first test only if it 
furthers the specific public interest of being likely to contribute 
significantly to public understanding of government operations or 
activities, regardless of any other public interest it may further. In 
analyzing this question, we will consider the following factors.
    (1) How, if at all, do the records to be disclosed pertain to the 
operations or activities of the Federal Government?
    (2) Would disclosure of the records reveal any meaningful 
information about government operations or activities? Can one learn 
from these records anything about such operations that is not already 
public knowledge?
    (3) Will the disclosure advance the understanding of the general 
public as distinguished from a narrow segment of interested persons? 
Under this factor we may consider whether the requester is in a position 
to contribute to public understanding. For example, we may consider 
whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be 
necessary to understand the information, and whether the requester's 
intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the 
information among the public. An unsupported claim to be doing research 
for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a 
claim by a representative of the news media is better evidence.
    (4) Will the contribution to public understanding be a significant 
one? Will the public's understanding of the government's operations be 
substantially greater as a result of the disclosure?
    (c) Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest. If the 
disclosure passes the test of furthering the specific public interest 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, we will determine whether it 
also furthers the requester's commercial interest and, if so, whether 
this effect outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In 
applying this second test, we will consider the following factors:
    (1) Would the disclosure further a commercial interest of the 
requester, or of someone on whose behalf the requester is acting? 
``Commercial interests'' include interests relating to business, trade, 
and profit. Not only profit-making corporations have commercial 
interests--so do nonprofit corporations, individuals, unions, and other 
associations. The interest of a representative of the news media in 
using the information for news dissemination purposes will not be 
considered a commercial interest.
    (2) If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the 
requester, would that effect outweigh the advancement of the public 
interest defined in paragraph (b) of this section? Which effect is 
primary?
    (d) Deciding between waiver and reduction. If the disclosure passes 
both tests, we will normally waive fees. However, in some cases we may 
decide only to reduce the fees. For example, we may do this when 
disclosure of some but not all of the requested records passes the 
tests.
    (e) Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction. You must make 
your request for a waiver or reduction at the same time you make your 
request for records. You should explain why you believe a waiver or 
reduction is proper under the analysis in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section. Only FOI Officers may make the decision whether to waive, 
or reduce, the fees. If we do not completely grant your request for a 
waiver or reduction, the denial letter will designate a review official. 
You may appeal the denial to that official. In your appeal letter, you 
should discuss whatever reasons are given in our denial letter. The 
process prescribed in Sec. 5.34(c) of this part will also apply to these 
appeals.


<R04>
           Subpart E--Records Available for Public Inspection


<R05>
Sec. 5.51  Records available.

    (a) Records of general interest. We will make the following records 
of general interest available for your inspection and copying. Before 
releasing them, however, we may delete the names of people, or 
information that would identify them, if release would invade their 
personal privacy to a clearly unwarranted degree. (See Sec. 5.67 of this 
part.)
    (1) Orders and final opinions, including concurring and dissenting 
opinions in adjudications, such as Letters of Finding issued by the 
Office for Civil

[[Page 27]]

Rights in civil rights complaints, and Social Security Rulings. (See 
Sec. 5.66 of this part for availability of internal memoranda, including 
attorney opinions and advice.)
    (2) Statements of policy and interpretations that we have adopted 
but have not published in the Federal Register.
    (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that 
affect the public. (We will not make available, however, manuals or 
instructions that reveal investigative or audit procedures as described 
in Sec.Sec. 5.63 and 5.68 of this part.)
    (b) Other records. In addition to such records as those described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, we will make available to any person a 
copy of all other agency records, unless we determine that such records 
should be withheld from disclosure under subsection (b) of the Act and 
Subpart F of this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 5.52  Indexes of records.

    (a) Inspection and copying. We will maintain and provide for your 
inspection and copying current indexes of the records described in Sec. 
5.51(a). We will also publish and distribute copies of the indexes 
unless we announce in the Federal Register that it is unnecessary or 
impracticable to do so. For assistance in locating indexes maintained in 
the Department, you may contact the HHS Freedom of Information Officer 
at the address and telephone number in Sec. 5.31(c).
    (b) Record citation as precedent. We will not use or cite any record 
described in Sec. 5.51(a) as a precedent for an action against a person 
unless we have indexed the record and published it or made it available, 
or unless the person has timely notice of the record.


<R04>
             Subpart F--Reasons for Withholding Some Records


<R05>
Sec. 5.61  General.

    Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine 
exemptions to the mandatory disclosure of records. We describe these 
exemptions below and explain how this Department applies them to 
disclosure determinations. (In some cases more than one exemption may 
apply to the same document.) Information obtained by the Department from 
any individual or organization, furnished in reliance on a provision for 
confidentiality authorized by applicable statute or regulation, will not 
be disclosed, to the extent it can be withheld under one of these 
exemptions. This section does not itself authorize the giving of any 
pledge of confidentiality by any officer or employee of the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 5.62  Exemption one: National defense and foreign policy.

    We are not required to release records that, as provided by FOIA, 
are ``(a) specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and (b) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
Executive Order.'' Executive Order No. 12356 (1982) provides for such 
classification. When the release of certain records may adversely affect 
U.S. relations with foreign countries, we usually consult with officials 
of those countries or officials of the Department of State. Also, we may 
on occasion have in our possession records classified by some other 
agency. We may refer your request for such records to the agency that 
classified them and notify you that we have done so, as explained in 
Sec. 5.23.


<R05>
Sec. 5.63  Exemption two: Internal personnel rules and practices.

    We are not required to release records that are ``related solely to 
the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.'' Under this 
exemption, we may withhold routine internal agency practices and 
procedures. For example, we may withhold guard schedules and rules 
governing parking facilities or lunch periods. Also under this 
exemption, we may withhold internal records whose release would help 
some persons circumvent the law or agency regulations. For example, we 
ordinarily do not disclose manuals that instruct our investigators or 
auditors how to investigate possible violations of law, to the extent 
that this release would help some persons circumvent the law.

[[Page 28]]


<R05>
Sec. 5.64  Exemption three: Records exempted by other statutes.

    We are not required to release records if another statute 
specifically allows us to withhold them. We may use another statute to 
justify withholding only if it absolutely prohibits disclosure or if it 
sets forth criteria to guide our decision on releasing or identifies 
particular types of material to be withheld.


<R05>
Sec. 5.65  Exemption four: Trade secrets and confidential commercial or 
financial information.

    We will withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information that is obtained from a person and is privileged or 
confidential.
    (a) Trade secrets. A trade secret is a secret, commercially valuable 
plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, 
preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can 
be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial 
effort. There must be a direct relationship between the trade secret and 
the productive process.
    (b) Commercial or financial information. We will not disclose 
records whose information is ``commercial or financial,'' is obtained 
from a person, and is ``privileged or confidential.''
    (1) Information is ``commercial or financial'' if it relates to 
businesses, commerce, trade, employment, profits, or finances (including 
personal finances). We interpret this category broadly.
    (2) Information is ``obtained from a person'' if HHS or another 
agency has obtained it from someone outside the Federal Government or 
from someone within the Government who has a commercial or financial 
interest in the information. ``Person'' includes an individual, 
partnership, corporation, association, state or foreign government, or 
other organization. Information is not ``obtained from a person'' if it 
is generated by HHS or another federal agency. However, information is 
``obtained from a person'' if it is provided by someone, including but 
not limited to an agency employee, who retains a commercial or financial 
interest in the information.
    (3) Information is ``privileged'' if it would ordinarily be 
protected from disclosure in civil discovery by a recognized evidentiary 
privilege, such as the attorney-client privilege or the work product 
privilege. Information may be privileged for this purpose under a 
privilege belonging to a person outside the government, unless the 
providing of the information to the government rendered the information 
no longer protectable in civil discovery.
    (4) Information is ``confidential'' if it meets one of the following 
tests:
    (i) Disclosure may impair the government's ability to obtain 
necessary information in the future;
    (ii) Disclosure would substantially harm the competitive position of 
the person who submitted the information;
    (iii) Disclosure would impair other government interests, such as 
program effectiveness and compliance; or
    (iv) Disclosure would impair other private interests, such as an 
interest in controlling availability of intrinsically valuable records, 
which are sold in the market by their owner.

The following questions may be relevant in analyzing whether a record 
meets one or more of the above tests: Is the information of a type 
customarily held in strict confidence and not disclosed to the public by 
the person to whom it belongs? What is the general custom or usage with 
respect to such information in the relevant occupation or business? How 
many, and what types of, individuals have access to the information? 
What kind and degree of financial injury can be expected if the 
information is disclosed?
    (c) Designation of certain confidential information. A person who 
submits records to the government may designate part or all of the 
information in such records as exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 
of the FOIA. The person may make this designation either at the time the 
records are submitted to the government or within a reasonable time 
thereafter. The designation must be in writing. Where a legend is 
required by a request for proposals or request for quotations, pursuant 
to 48 CFR 352.215-12, then that legend is necessary for this purpose. 
Any such designation will expire ten years

[[Page 29]]

after the records were submitted to the government.
    (d) Predisclosure notification. The procedures in this paragraph 
apply to records on which the submitter has designated information as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section. They also apply to records 
that were submitted to the government where we have substantial reason 
to believe that information in the records could reasonably be 
considered exempt under Exemption 4. Certain exceptions to these 
procedures are stated in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (1) When we receive a request for such records, and we determine 
that we may be required to disclose them, we will make reasonable 
efforts to notify the submitter about these facts. The notice will 
include a copy of the request, and it will inform the submitter about 
the procedures and time limits for submission and consideration of 
objections to disclosure. If we must notify a large number of 
submitters, we may do this by posting or publishing a notice in a place 
where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of it.
    (2) The submitter has five working days from receipt of the notice 
to object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all 
bases for its objections.
    (3) We will give consideration to all bases that have been timely 
stated by the submitter. If we decide to disclose the records, we will 
notify the submitter in writing. This notice will briefly explain why we 
did not sustain its objections. We will include with the notice a copy 
of the records about which the submitter objected, as we propose to 
disclose them. The notice will state that we intend to disclose the 
records five working days after the submitter receives the notice unless 
we are ordered by a United States District Court not to release them.
    (4) When a requester files suit under the FOIA to obtain records 
covered by this paragraph, we will promptly notify the submitter.
    (5) Whenever we send a notice to a submitter under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section, we will notify the requester that we are giving the 
submitter a notice and an opportunity to object. Whenever we send a 
notice to a submitter under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, we will 
notify the requester of this fact.
    (e) Exceptions to predisclosure notification. The notice 
requirements in paragraph (d) of this section do not apply in the 
following situations:
    (1) We decided not to disclose the records;
    (2) The information has previously been published or made generally 
available;
    (3) Disclosure is required by a regulation, issued after notice and 
opportunity for public comment, that specifies narrow categories of 
records that are to be disclosed under the FOIA, but in this case a 
submitter may still designate records as described in paragraph (c) of 
this section, and in exceptional cases, we may, at our discretion, 
follow the notice procedures in paragraph (d) of this section; or
    (4) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this 
case we will still give the submitter the written notice required by 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section (although this notice need not explain 
our decision or include a copy of the records), and we will notify the 
requester as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 5.66  Exemption five: Internal memoranda.

    This exemption covers internal government communications and notes 
that fall within a generally recognized evidentiary privilege. Internal 
government communications include an agency's communications with an 
outside consultant or other outside person, with a court, or with 
Congress, when those communications are for a purpose similar to the 
purpose of privileged intra-agency communications. Some of the most-
commonly applicable privileges are described in the following 
paragraphs.
    (a) Deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects 
predecisional deliberative communications. A communication is protected 
under this privilege if it was made before a final decision was reached 
on some question of policy and if it expressed recommendations or 
opinions on that question. The purpose of the privilege is to prevent

[[Page 30]]

injury to the quality of the agency decisionmaking process by 
encouraging open and frank internal policy discussions, by avoiding 
premature disclosure of policies not yet adopted, and by avoiding the 
public confusion that might result from disclosing reasons that were not 
in fact the ultimate grounds for an agency's decision. Purely factual 
material in a deliberative document is within this privilege only if it 
is inextricably intertwined with the deliberative portions so that it 
cannot reasonably be segregated, if it would reveal the nature of the 
deliberative portions, or if its disclosure would in some other way make 
possible an intrusion into the decisionmaking process. We will release 
purely factual material in a deliberative document unless that material 
is otherwise exempt. The privilege continues to protect predecisional 
documents even after a decision is made.
    (b) Attorney work product privilege. This privilege protects 
documents prepared by or for an agency, or by or for its representative 
(typically, HHS attorneys) in anticipation of litigation or for trial. 
It includes documents prepared for purposes of administrative 
adjudications as well as court litigation. It includes documents 
prepared by program offices as well as by attorneys. It includes factual 
material in such documents as well as material revealing opinions and 
tactics. Finally, the privilege continues to protect the documents even 
after the litigation is closed.
    (c) Attorney-client communication privilege. This privilege protects 
confidential communications between a lawyer and an employee or agent of 
the government where there is an attorney-client relationship between 
them (typically, where the lawyer is acting as attorney for the agency 
and the employee is communicating on behalf of the agency) and where the 
employee has communicated information to the attorney in confidence in 
order to obtain legal advice or assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 5.67  Exemption six: Clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

    (a) Documents affected. We may withhold records about individuals if 
disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of their 
personal privacy.
    (b) Balancing test. In deciding whether to release records to you 
that contain personal or private information about someone else, we 
weigh the foreseeable harm of invading that person's privacy against the 
public benefit that would result from the release. If you were seeking 
information for a purely commercial venture, for example, we might not 
think that disclosure would primarily benefit the public and we would 
deny your request. On the other hand, we would be more inclined to 
release information if you were working on a research project that gave 
promise of providing valuable information to a wide audience. However, 
in our evaluation of requests for records we attempt to guard against 
the release of information that might involve a violation of personal 
privacy because of a requester being able to ``read between the lines'' 
or piece together items that would constitute information that normally 
would be exempt from mandatory disclosure under Exemption Six.
    (c) Examples. Some of the information that we frequently withhold 
under Exemption Six is: Home addresses, ages, and minority group status 
of our employees or former employees; social security numbers; medical 
information about individuals participating in clinical research 
studies; names and addresses of individual beneficiaries of our 
programs, or benefits such individuals receive; earning records, claim 
files, and other personal information maintained by the Social Security 
Administration, the Public Health Service, and theCenters for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services.


<R05>
Sec. 5.68  Exemption seven: Law enforcement.

    We are not required to disclose information or records that the 
government has compiled for law enforcement purposes. The records may 
apply to actual or potential violations of either criminal or civil laws 
or regulations. We can withhold these records only to the extent that 
releasing them would cause harm in at least one of the following 
situations:
    (a) Enforcement proceedings. We may withhold information whose 
release

[[Page 31]]

could reasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing 
law enforcement proceedings. Investigations of fraud and mismanagement, 
employee misconduct, and civil rights violations may fall into this 
category. In certain cases--such as when a fraud investigation is 
likely--we may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records that 
relate to the violations in order not to disclose that an investigation 
is in progress, or may be conducted.
    (b) Fair trial or impartial adjudication. We may withhold records 
whose release would deprive a person of a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication because of prejudicial publicity.
    (c) Personal privacy. We are careful not to disclose information 
that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion 
of personal privacy. When a name surfaces in an investigation, that 
person is likely to be vulnerable to innuendo, rumor, harassment, and 
retaliation.
    (d) Confidential sources and information. We may withhold records 
whose release could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source of information. A confidential source may be an 
individual; a state, local, or foreign government agency; or any private 
organization. The exemption applies whether the source provides 
information under an express promise of confidentiality or under 
circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred. 
Also, where the record, or information in it, has been compiled by a 
criminal law enforcement authority conducting a criminal investigation, 
or by an agency conducting a lawful national security investigation, the 
exemption also protects all information supplied by a confidential 
source. Also protected from mandatory disclosure is any information 
which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the 
system of confidentiality that assures a flow of information from 
sources to investigatory agencies.
    (e) Techniques and procedures. We may withhold records reflecting 
special techniques or procedures of investigation or prosecution, not 
otherwise generally known to the public. In some cases, it is not 
possible to describe even in general terms those techniques without 
disclosing the very material to be withheld. We may also withhold 
records whose release would disclose guidelines for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions if this disclosure could reasonably be 
expected to create a risk that someone could circumvent requirements of 
law or of regulation.
    (f) Life and physical safety. We may withhold records whose 
disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual. This protection extends to threats and 
harassment as well as to physical violence.


<R05>
Sec. 5.69  Exemptions 8 and 9: Records on financial institutions; records 
on wells.

    Exemption eight permits us to withhold records about regulation or 
supervision of financial institutions. Exemption nine permits the 
withholding of geological and geophysical information and data, 
including maps, concerning wells.

anyone other than the subject individual.
    (e) Individual means a living person who is a citizen of the United 
States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. It does 
not include persons such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or 
corporations. A business firm which is identified by the name of one or 
more persons is not an individual within the meaning of this part.

a subject individual.
    (h) Record means any item, collection, or grouping of information 
about an individual that is maintained by the Department, including but 
not limited to the individual's education, financial transactions, 
medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains 
his name, or an identifying number, symbol, or other identifying 
particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print 
or a photograph. When used in this part, record means only a record 
which is in a system of records.
    (i) Responsible Department official means that officer who is listed 
in a notice of a system of records as the system manager for a given 
system of records or another individual listed in the notice of a system 
of records to whom requests may be made, or the designee of either such 
officer or individual.
    (j) Routine use means the disclosure of a record outside the 
Department, without the consent of the subject individual, for a purpose 
which is compatible with the purpose for which the record was collected. 
It includes disclosures required to be made by statute other than the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. It does not include

his designee.
    (l) Statistical record means a record maintained for statistical

of the Department from which a record is retrieved by personal 
identifier such as the name of the individual, number, symbol or other 
unique retriever assigned to the individual. Single records or groups of 
records which are not retrieved by a personal identifier are not part of 
a system of records. Papers maintained by individual employees of the 
Department which are prepared, maintained, or discarded at the 
discretion of the employee and which are not subject to the Federal 
Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2901, are not part of a system of records; 
Provided, That such personal papers are not used by the employee or the 
Department to determine any rights, benefits, or privileges of 
individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 5b.2  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part implements section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 
U.S.C. 552a (hereinafter referred to as the Act), by establishing agency

U.S.C. 552, and Part 5 of this title.
    (3) Govern the maintenance or disclosure of, notification of or 
access to, records in the possession of the Department which are subject

individual or party to such litigation or proceedings shall be governed 
by applicable constitutional principles, rules of discovery, and 
applicable regulations of the Department and any of its components.


<R05>
Sec. 5b.3  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Department to protect the privacy of 
individuals to the fullest extent possible while nonetheless permitting 
the exchange of records required to fulfill the administrative and 
program responsibilities of the Department, and responsibilities of the 
Department for disclosing records which the general public is entitled 
to have under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and Part 5 
of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 5b.4  Maintenance of records.

    (a) No record will be maintained by the Department unless:
    (1) It is relevant and necessary to accomplish a Department function 
required to be accomplished by statute or Executive Order;
    (2) It is acquired to the greatest extent practicable from the 
subject individual when maintenance of the record may result in a 
determination about the subject individual's rights, benefits or 
privileges under Federal programs;
    (3) The individual providing the record is informed of the authority 
for

[[Page 34]]

providing the record (including whether the providing of the record is 
mandatory or voluntary, the principal purpose for maintaining the 
record, the routine uses for the record, what effect his refusal to 
provide the record may have on him), and if the record is not required 
by statute or Executive Order to be provided by the individual, he 
agrees to provide the record.
    (b) No record will be maintained by the Department which describes 
how an individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment 
unless expressly authorized (1) by statute, or (2) by the subject 
individual, or (3) unless pertinent to and within the scope of an 
authorized law enforcement activity.


<R05>
Sec. 5b.5  Notification of or access to records.

    (a) Times, places, and manner of requesting notification of or 
access to a record. (1) Subject to the provisions governing medical 
records in Sec. 5b.6 of this part, any individual may request 
notification of a record. He may at the same time request access to any 
record pertaining to him. An individual may be accompanied by another 
individual of his choice when he requests access to a record in person; 
Provided, That he affirmatively authorizes the presence of such other 
individual during any discussion of a record to which access is 
requested.
    (2) An individual making a request for notification of or access to 
a record shall address his request to the responsible Department 
official and shall verify his identity when required in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the time the request is made, the 
individual shall specify which systems of records he wishes to have 
searched and the records to which he wishes to have access. He may also 
request that copies be made of all or any such records. An individual 
shall also provide the responsible Department official with sufficient 
particulars to enable such official to distinguish between records on 
subject individuals with the same name. The necessary particulars are 
set forth in the notices of systems of records.
    (3) An individual who makes a request in person may leave with any 
responsible Department official a request for notification of or access 
to a record under the control of another responsible Department 
official; Provided, That the request is addressed in writing to the 
appropriate responsible Department official.
    (b) Verification of identity--(1) When required. Unless an 
individual, who is making a request for notification of or access to a 
record in person, is personally known to the responsible Department 
official, he shall be required to verify his identity in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section if:
    (i) He makes a request for notification of a record and the 
responsible Department official determines that the mere disclosure of 
the existence of the record would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
privacy if disclosed to someone other than the subject individual; or,
    (ii) He makes a request for access to a record which is not required 
to be disclosed to the general public under the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and Part 5 of this title.
    (2) Manner of verifying identity. (i) An individual who makes a 
request in person shall provide to the responsible Department official 
at least one piece of tangible identification such as a driver's 
license, passport, alien or voter registration card, or union card to 
verify his identity. If an individual does not have identification 
papers to verify his identity, he shall certify in writing that he is 
the individual who he claims to be and that he understands that the 
knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to 
an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act 
subject to a $5,000 fine.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, an 
individual who does not make a request in person shall submit a 
notarized request to the responsible Department official to verify his 
identity or shall certify in his request that he is the individual who 
he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful 
request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under 
false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act subject to a $5,000 
fine.

[[Page 35]]

    (iii) An individual who makes a request on behalf of a minor or 
legal incompetent as authorized under Sec. 5b.10 of this part shall 
verify his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent, in addition 
to verifying his own identity, by providing a copy of the minor's birth 
certificate, a court order, or other competent evidence of guardianship 
to the responsible Department official; except that, an individual is 
not required to verify his relationship to the minor or legal 
incompetent when he is not required to verify his own identity or when 
evidence of his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent has been 
previously given to the responsible Department official.
    (iv) An individual shall further verify his identity if he is 
requesting notification of or access to sensitive records such as 
medical records. Any further verification shall parallel the record to 
which notification or access is being sought. Such further verification 
may include such particulars as the individual's years of attendance at 
a particular educational institution, rank attained in the uniformed 
services, date or place of birth, names of parents, an occupation or the 
specific times the individual received medical treatment.
    (v) An individual who makes a request by telephone shall verify his 
identity by providing to the responsible Department official identifying 
particulars which parallel the record to which notification or access is 
being sought. If the responsible Department official determines that the 
particulars provided by telephone are insufficient, the requester will 
be required to submit the request in writing or in person. Telephone 
requests will not be accepted where an individual is requesting 
notification of or access to sensitive records such as medical records.
    (c) Granting notification of or access to a record. (1) Subject to 
the provisions governing medical records in Sec. 5b.6 of this part and 
the provisions governing exempt systems in Sec. 5b.11 of this part, a 
responsible Department official, who receives a request for notification 
of or access to a record and, if required, verification of an 
individual's identity, will review the request and grant notification or 
access to a record, if the individual requesting access to the record is 
the subject individual.
    (2) If the responsible Department official determines that there 
will be a delay in responding to a request because of the number of 
requests being processed, a breakdown of equipment, shortage of 
personnel, storage of records in other locations, etc., he will so 
inform the individual and indicate when notification or access will be 
granted.
    (3) Prior to granting notification of or access to a record, the 
responsible Department official may at his discretion require an 
individual making a request in person to reduce his request to writing 
if the individual has not already done so at the time the request is 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 5b.6  Special procedures for notification of or access to medical 
records.

    (a) General. An individual in general has a right to notification of 
or access to his medical records, including psychological records, as 
well as to other records pertaining to him maintained by the Department. 
This section sets forth special procedures as permitted by the Act for 
notification of or access to medical records, including a special 
procedure for notification of or access to medical records of minors. 
The special procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section may 
not be suitable for use by every component of the Department. Therefore, 
components may follow the paragraph (b) procedure for notification of or 
access to medical records, or may issue regulations establishing special 
procedures for such purposes. The special procedure set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section relating to medical records of minors is 
mandatory.
    (b) Medical records procedures--(1) Notification of or access to 
medical records. (i) Any individual may request notification of or 
access to a medical record pertaining to him. Unless the individual is a 
parent or guardian requesting notification of or access to a minor's 
medical record, an individual shall make a request for a medical record 
in accordance with this section and the procedures in Sec. 5b.5 of this 
part.
    (ii) An individual who requests notification of or access to a 
medical record

[[Page 36]]

shall, at the time the request is made, designate a representative in 
writing. The representative may be a physician, other health 
professional, or other responsible individual, who would be willing to 
review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at 
the representative's discretion.
    (2) Utilization of the designated representative. A subject 
individual will be granted direct access to a medical record if the 
responsible official determines that direct access is not likely to have 
an adverse effect on the subject individual. If the responsible 
Department official believes that he is not qualified to determine, or 
if he does determine, that direct access to the subject individual is 
likely to have an adverse effect on the subject individual, the record 
will be sent to the designated representative. The subject individual 
will be informed in writing that the record has been sent.
    (c) Medical records of minors--(1) Requests by minors; notification 
of or access to medical records to minors. A minor may request 
notification of or access to a medical record pertaining to him in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Requests on a minor's behalf; notification of or access to 
medical records to an individual on a minor's behalf. (i) In order to 
protect the privacy of a minor, a parent or guardian, authorized to act 
on a minor's behalf as provided in Sec. 5b.10 of this part, who makes a 
request for notification of or access to a minor's medical record will 
not be given direct notification of or access to such record.
    (ii) A parent or guardian shall make all requests for notification 
of or access to a minor's medical record in accordance with this 
paragraph and the procedures in Sec. 5b.5 of this part. A parent or 
guardian shall at the time he makes a request designate a family 
physician or other health professional (other than a family member) to 
whom the record, if any, will be sent.
    (iii) Where a medical record on the minor exists, it will be sent to 
the physician or health professional designated by the parent or 
guardian in all cases. If disclosure of the record would constitute an 
invasion of the minor's privacy, that fact will be brought to the 
attention of the physician or health professional to whom the record is 
sent. The physician or health professional will be asked to consider the 
effect that disclosure of the record to the parent or guardian would 
have on the minor in determining whether the minor's medical record 
should be made available to the parent or guardian. Response to the 
parent or guardian making the request will be made in substantially the 
following form:

We have completed processing your request for notification of or access 
to______________________________________________________________________

----------------------------------------------'s

 (Name of minor)

medical records. Please be informed that if any medical record were 
found pertaining to that individual, they have not been sent to your 
designated physician or health professional.


In each case where a minor's medical record is sent to a physician or 
health professional, reasonable efforts will be made to so inform the 
minor.


<R05>
Sec. 5b.7  Procedures for correction or amendment of records.

    (a) Any subject individual may request that his record be corrected 
or amended if he believes that the record is not accurate, timely, 
complete, or relevant or necessary to accomplish a Department function. 
A subject individual making a request to amend or correct his record 
shall address his request to the responsible Department official in 
writing; except that, the request need not be in writing if the subject 
individual makes his request in person and the responsible Department 
official corrects or amends the record at that time. The subject 
individual shall specify in each request:
    (1) The system of records from which the record is retrieved;
    (2) The particular record which he is seeking to correct or amend;
    (3) Whether he is seeking an addition to or a deletion or 
substitution of the record; and,
    (4) His reasons for requesting correction or amendment of the 
record.
    (b) A request for correction or amendment of a record will be 
acknowledged within 10 working days of its receipt unless the request 
can be

[[Page 37]]

processed and the subject individual informed of the responsible 
Department official's decision on the request within that 10 day period.
    (c) If the responsible Department official agrees that the record is 
not accurate, timely, or complete based on a preponderance of the 
evidence, the record will be corrected or amended. The record will be 
deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is not relevant or 
necessary to accomplish the Department function for which the record was 
provided or is maintained. In either case, the subject individual will 
be informed in writing of the correction, amendment, or deletion and, if 
accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous 
recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action 
taken.

to correct or amend the record will be informed in writing of the 
extension and the circumstances of the delay. The subject individual's 
request to amend or correct the record, the responsible Department 
official's refusal to correct or amend, and any other pertinent material 
relating to the appeal will be reviewed. No hearing will be held.
    (3) If the appeal authority agrees that the record subject to the

Department official in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section, the record will be noted to indicate that it is disputed. In 
any subsequent disclosure, a copy of the subject individual's statement 
of disagreement will be disclosed with the record. If the responsible 
Department official deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the 
appeal authority's reasons for denying the subject individual's appeal 
may also be disclosed with the record. While the subject individual will 
have access to this statement of reasons, such statement will not be 
subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of 
prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record 
will be provided a copy of the subject individual's statement of 
disagreement, as well as the statement, if any, of the appeal 
authority's reasons for denying the subject individual's appeal.

Discretionary notification of or access to a record in accordance with 
this paragraph will not be a precedent for discretionary notification of 
or access to a similar or related record and will not obligate the 
responsible Department official to exercise his discretion to grant 
notification of or access to any other record in a system of records 
which is exempt under paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 5b.13  Fees.

    (a) Policy. Where applicable, fees for copying records will be 
charged in accordance with the schedule set forth in this section. Fees 
may only be charged where an individual requests that a copy be made of

making a search of the system of records whether the search is manual, 
mechanical, or electronic. Where a copy of the record must be made in 
order to provide access to the record (e.g., computer printout where no 
screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to the 
individual without cost. Where a medical record is made available to a 
representative designated by the individual or to a physician or health 
professional designated by a parent or guardian under Sec. 5b.6 of this

          Appendix A to Part 5b--Employee Standards of Conduct

    (a) General. All employees are required to be aware of their 
responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. 
Regulations implementing the Act are set forth in 45 CFR 5b. Instruction 
on the requirements of the Act and regulation shall be provided to all 
new employees of the Department. In addition, supervisors shall be 
responsible for assuring that employees who are working with systems of 
records or who undertake new duties which require the use of systems of 
records are informed of their responsibilities. Supervisors shall also 
be responsible for assuring that all employees who work with such 
systems of records are periodically reminded of the requirements of the 
Act and are advised of any new provisions or interpretations of the Act.
    (b) Penalties. (1) All employees must guard against improper 
disclosure f records which are governed by the Act. Because of the 
serious consequences of improper invasions of personal privacy, 
employees may be subject to disciplinary action and criminal prosecution 
for knowing and willful violations of the Act and regulation. In 
addition, employees may also be subject to disciplinary action for 
unknowing or unwillful violations, where the employee had notice of the 
provisions of the Act and regulations and failed to inform himself 
sufficiently or to conduct himself in accordance with the requirements 
to avoid violations.
    (2) The Department may be subjected to civil liability for the 
following actions undertaken by its employees:
    (a) Making a determination under the Act and Sec.Sec. 5b.7 and 5b.8 
of the regulation not to amend an individual's record in accordance with 
his request, or failing to make such review in conformity with those 
provisions;
    (b) Refusing to comply with an individual's request for notification 
of or access to a record pertaining to hiem;
    (c) Failing to maintain any record pertaining to any individual with 
such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary 
to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications, 
character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual 
that may be made on the basis of such a record, and consequently a 
determination is made which is adverse to the individual; or
    (d) Failing to comply with any other provision of the Act or any 
rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect 
on an individual.
    (3) An employee may be personally subject to criminal liability as 
set forth below and in 5 U.S.C. 552a (i):
    (a) Any officer or employee of an agency, who by virtue of his 
employment or official position, has possession of, or access to, agency 
records which contain individually identifiable information the 
disclosure of which is prohibited by the Act or by rules or regulations 
established thereunder, and who, knowing that disclosure of the specific 
material is so prohibited, willfully discloses the material in any 
manner to any person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be 
guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.
    (b) Any officer or employee of any agency who willfully maintains a 
system of records without meeting the notice requirements [of the Act] 
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.
    (c) Rules Governing Employees Not Working With Systems of Records. 
Employees whose duties do not involve working with systems of records 
will not generally disclose to any one, without specific authorization 
from their supervisors, records pertaining to employees or other 
individuals which by reason of their official duties are available to 
them. Notwithstanding the above, the following records concerning 
Federal employees are a matter of public record and no further 
authorization is necessary for disclosure:
    (1) Name and title of individual.
    (2) Grade classification or equivalent and annual rate of salary.
    (3) Position description.
    (4) Location of duty station, including room number and telephone 
number.
    In addition, employees shall disclose records which are listed in 
the Department's Freedom of Information Regulation as being available to 
the public. Requests for other records will be referred to the 
responsible Department official. This does not preclude employees from 
discussing matters which are known to them personally, and without 
resort to a record, to official investigators of Federal agencies for 
official purposes such as suitability checks, Equal Employment 
Opportunity investigations, adverse action proceedings, grievance 
proceedings, etc.
    (d) Rules governing employees whose duties require use or reference 
to systems of records. Employees whose official duties require that they 
refer to, maintain, service, or otherwise deal with systems of records 
(hereinafter referred to as ``Systems Employees'') are governed by the 
general provisions. In addition, extra precautions are required and 
systems

[[Page 43]]

employees are held to higher standards of conduct.
    (1) Systems Employees shall:
    (a) Be informed with respect to their responsibilities under the 
Act;
    (b) Be alert to possible misuses of the system and report to their 
supervisors any potential or actual use of the system which they believe 
is not in compliance with the Act and regulation;
    (c) Make a disclosure of records within the Department only to an 
employee who has a legitimate need to know the record in the course of 
his official duties;
    (d) Maintain records as accurately as practicable.
    (e) Consult with a supervisor prior to taking any action where they 
are in doubt whether such action is in conformance with the Act and 
regulation.
    (2) Systems Employees shall not:
    (a) Disclose in any form records from a system of records except (1) 
with the consent or at the request of the subject individual; or (2) 
where its disclosure is permitted under Sec. 5b.9 of the regulation.
    (b) Permit unauthorized individuals to be present in controlled 
areas. Any unauthorized individuals observed in controlled areas shall 
be reported to a supervisor or to the guard force.
    (c) Knowingly or willfully take action which might subject the 
Department to civil liability.
    (d) Make any arrangements for the design development, or operation 
of any system of records without making reasonable effort to provide 
that the system can be maintained in accordance with the Act and 
regulation.
    (e) Contracting officers. In addition to any applicable provisions 
set forth above, those employees whose official duties involve entering 
into contracts on behalf of the Department shall also be governed by the 
following provisions:
    (1) Contracts for design, or development of systems and equipment. 
No contract for the design or development of a system of records, or for 
equipment to store, service or maintain a system of records shall be 
entered into unless the contracting officer has made reasonable effort 
to ensure that the product to be purchased is capable of being used 
without violation of the Act or regulation. Special attention shall be 
given to provision of physical safeguards.
    (2) Contracts for the operation of systems of records. A review by 
the Contracting Officer, in conjunction with other officials whom he 
feels appropriate, of all proposed contracts providing for the operation 
of systems of records shall be made prior to execution of the contracts 
to determine whether operation of the system of records is for the 
purpose of accomplishing a Department function. If a determination is 
made that the operation of the system is to accomplish a Department 
function, the contracting officer shall be responsible for including in 
the contract appropriate provisions to apply the provisions of the Act 
and regulation to the system, including prohibitions against improper 
release by the contractor, his employees, agents, or subcontractors.
    (3) Other service contracts. Contracting officers entering into 
general service contracts shall be responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of including provisions in the contract to prevent 
potential misuse (inadvertent or otherwise) by employees, agents, or 
subcontractors of the contractor.
    (f) Rules Governing Responsible Department Officials. In addition to 
the requirements for Systems Employees, responsible Department officials 
shall:
    (1) Respond to all requests for notification of or access, 
disclosure, or amendment of records in a timely fashion in accordance 
with the Act and regulation;
    (2) Make any amendment of records accurately and in a timely 
fashion;
    (3) Inform all persons whom the accounting records show have 
received copies of the record prior to the amendments of the correction; 
and
    (4) Associate any statement of disagreement with the disputed 
record, and
    (a) Transmit a copy of the statement to all persons whom the 
accounting records show have received a copy of the disputed record, and
    (b) Transmit that statement with any future disclosure.

regulation, rule or order issued pursuant thereto, the relevant records 
in the system of records may be referred, as a routine use, to the 
appropriate agency, whether federal, or foreign, charged with the 
responsibility of investigating or prosecuting such violation or charged 
with enforcing or implementing the statute, or rule, regulation or order 
issued pursuant thereto.

Sec. 7.0  Who are employees.

    As used in this part, the term Government employee means any officer 
or employee, civilian or military, except such part-time employees or 
part-time consultants as may be excluded therefrom by a determination 
made in writing by the head of the employee's office or constituent 
organization, pursuant to an exemption approved by the Commissioner of 
Patents that to include him or them would be impracticable or 
inequitable, given the reasons therefor. A person shall not be 
considered to be a part-time employee or part-time consultant for this 
purpose unless the terms of his employment contemplate that he shall 
work for less than the minimum number of hours per day, or less than a 
minimum number of days per week, or less than the minimum

[[Page 45]]

number of weeks per year, regularly required of full-time employees of 
his class.

[27 FR 7986, Aug. 10, 1962]


<R05>
Sec. 7.1  Duty of employee to report inventions.

    Every Department employee is required to report to the Assistant 
Secretary (Health and Scientific Affairs) in accordance with the 
procedures established therefor, every invention made by him (whether or 
not jointly with others) which bears any relation to his official duties 
or which was made in whole or in any part during working hours, or with 
any contribution of Government facilities, equipment, material, funds, 
or information, or of time or services of other Government employees on 
official duty.

[31 FR 12842, Oct. 1, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 7.3  Determination as to domestic rights.

    The determination of the ownership of the domestic right, title, and 
interest in and to an invention which is or may be patentable, made by a 
Government employee while under the administrative jurisdiction of the 
Department, shall be made in writing by the Assistant Secretary (Health 
and Scientific Affairs), in accordance with the provisions of Executive 
Order 10096 and Government-wide regulations issued thereunder by the 
Commissioner of Patents as follows:
    (a) The Government as represented by the Assistant Secretary (Health 
and Scientific Affairs) shall obtain the entire domestic right, title 
and interest in and to all inventions made by any Government employee 
(1) during working hours, or (2) with a contribution by the Government 
of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information, or of time 
or services of other Government employees on official duty, or (3) which 
bear a direct relation to or are made in consequence of the official 
duties of the inventor.
    (b) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as 
measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) 
of this section, to the invention is insufficient equitably to justify a 
requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire domestic 
right, title and interest in and to such invention, or in any case where 
the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain the 
entire domestic right, title, and interest therein (although the 
Government could obtain same under paragraph (a) of this section), the 
Department, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, shall leave 
title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the 
reservation to the Government of a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-
free license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all 
governmental purposes, such reservation to appear, where practicable, in 
any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.
    (c) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any 
particular invention, it shall be presumed that an invention made by an 
employee who is employed or assigned (1) to invent or improve or perfect 
any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, (2) to conduct 
or perform research, development work, or both, (3) to supervise, 
direct, coordinate, or review Government financed or conducted research, 
development work, or both, or (4) to act in a liaison capacity among 
governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged in such 
work, falls within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, and 
it shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls 
within the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. Either 
presumption may be rebutted by a showing of the facts and circumstances 
and shall not preclude a determination that these facts and 
circumstances justify leaving the entire right, title and interest in 
and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.
    (d) In any case wherein the Government neither (1) obtains the 
entire domestic right, title and interest in and to an invention 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, nor (2) 
reserves a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the 
invention, with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)

[[Page 46]]

of this section, the Government shall leave the entire right, title and 
interest in and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to 
law.

<R05>
Sec. 7.4  Option to acquire foreign rights.

    In any case where it is determined that all domestic rights should 
be assigned to the Government, it shall further be determined, pursuant 
to Executive Order 9865 and Government-wide regulations issued 
thereunder, that the Government shall reserve an option to require the 
assignment of such rights in all or in any specified foreign countries. 
In case where the inventor is not required to assign the patent rights 
in any foreign country or countries to the Government or the Government 
fails to exercise its option within such period of time as may be 
provided by regulations issued by the Commissioner of Patents, any 
application for a patent which may be filed in such country or countries 
by the inventor or his assignee shall nevertheless be subject to a 
nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to the Government for 
all governmental purposes, including the power to issue sublicenses for 
use in behalf of the Government and/or in furtherance of the foreign 
policies of the Government.

[27 FR 7987, Aug. 10, 1962]


<R05>
Sec. 7.7  Notice to employee of determination.

    The employee-inventor shall be notified in writing of the 
Department's determination of the rights to his invention and of his 
right of appeal, if any. Notice need not be given if the employee stated 
in writing that he would agree to the determination of ownership which 
was in fact made.

[31 FR 12842, Oct. 1, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 7.8  Employee's right of appeal.

    An employee who is aggrieved by a determination of the Department 
may appeal to the Commissioner of Patents, pursuant to section 4(d) of 
Executive Order 10096, as amended by Executive Order 10930, and 
regulations issued thereunder, by filing a written appeal with the 
Commissioner, in duplicate, and a copy of the appeal with the Assistant 
Secretary (Health and Scientific Affairs), within 30 days (or such 
longer period as the Commissioner may, for good cause, fix in any case) 
after receiving written notice of such determination.

Sec. 9.1  Purpose.

    To enhance the availability of DHHS scientific research and study 
facilities to academic scientists, engineers, and qualified students.


<R05>
Sec. 9.2  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services in 
accordance with the policy of the President announced on February 21, 
1969, to make research and study facilities of the Department readily 
available to the scientific community, especially qualified academic 
scientists and engineers. Unique, unusual, and expensive-to-duplicate 
facilities at laboratories and other study and research facilities of 
the Department will be made available to the national scientific 
community, to the maximum extent practical without serious detriment to 
the missions of those facilities. It is also the policy of the 
Department to permit qualified students and graduates of institutions of 
learning in the several States, and territories, as well as the District 
of Columbia, to use study and research facilities of the Department.

[[Page 47]]

When such facilities are used by academic scientists, engineers, and 
students, the costs incurred for the operation of the unique or unusual 
research facilities, as well as of the other facilities, should be 
funded by the operating agency responsible for the operation of that 
facility, except for any significant incremental costs incurred in 
support of research not directly related to an HHS mission.


<R05>
Sec. 9.3  Delegations of authority.

    (a) The heads of operating agencies are delegated authority for 
negotiations and decisions as to the use of Department facilities by 
qualified academic scientists, engineers, and students.
    (b) The heads of operating agencies may (and are encouraged to) 
redelegate to the heads of their respective component organizations, 
with the power to further redelegate to laboratory directors, the 
authority for negotiations and decisions as to the use of departmental 
facilities. Appropriate use shall be made of advisory groups in 
formulating their decisions.


<R05>
Sec. 9.4  Criteria.

    (a) The official permitting use of Department facilities must 
determine that it would be consistent with the programs of his activity 
to participate. Facilities may be made available provided the use of 
such facilities will be of direct benefit to the objectives of the 
academic scientist, or engineer, or student, with the prospect of 
fruitful interchange of ideas and information between Department 
personnel and the academic scientist, or engineer, or student, and such 
use will not interfere with the Department program.
    (b) The official permitting use of Department facilities will 
furnish the non-Government user with safety requirements or operating 
procedures to be followed. Such requirements or procedures are to 
include the requirement to report to the permitting official any 
accident involving the non-Government user.
    (c) The official delegated authority for approving the use of 
Department facilities will not permit the use of laboratory facilities 
unless he determines:
    (1) That facilities are available for the period desired; and
    (2) That the proposed research will not interfere with regular 
Department functions or needs, nor require the subsequent acquisition of 
additional equipment by the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 9.5  Restrictions.

    (a) Each individual authorized to use Department facilities will be 
expected to use the facilities and equipment with customary care and 
otherwise conduct himself in such manner as to complete his research or 
study within any time limits prescribed.
    (b) Each individual authorized to use HHS facilities may not be 
authorized to sign requisitions for supplies and equipment.
    (c) Any official approving the use of HHS facilities should seek an 
agreement, executed by non-Government users, absolving the Federal 
agency of liability in case of personal injury, death, and failure or 
damage to the non-Government user's experiments or equipment. The 
agreement must also contain a statement that the non-Government user 
will comply with all safety regulations and procedures while using such 
facilities.

including research.

[[Page 49]]

    (b) Transfers may be made only to States, their political 
subdivisions and instrumentalities, tax-supported public health 
institutions, and nonprofit public health institutions which (except for 
institutions which lease property to assist the homeless under Title V 
of Pub. L. 100-77) have been held tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of

    (c) Real property will be requested for assignment only when the 
Department has determined that the property is suitable and needed for 
public health purposes. The amount of real and related personal property

not met, the transferee shall either commence payments in cash to the 
Department for each month thereafter during which the proposed use has 
not been implemented or take such other action as set forth in Sec. 
12.12 as is deemed appropriate by the Department. Such monthly payments

property at the time of the first payment by subtracting therefrom any 
portion of the purchase price paid in cash at the time of transfer, and 
by dividing the balance by the total number of months in the period of 
restriction. If the facility has not been placed into use within eight

Sec. 12.6  Notice of available property.

    Reasonable publicity will be given to the availability of surplus 
real property which is suitable for assignment to the Department for 
transfer for public health uses. The Department will establish 
procedures reasonably calculated to afford all eligible users having a 
legitimate interest in acquiring the property for such uses an 
opportunity to make an application therefor. However, publicity need not 
be given to the availability of surplus real property which is occupied 
and being used for eligible public health purposes at the time the 
property is declared surplus, the occupant expresses interest in the 
property, and the Department determines that it has a continuing need 
therefor.

Sec. 12.7  Applications for surplus real property.

    Applications for surplus real property for public health purposes

    (b) Requests to the Administrator for assignment of surplus real 
property to the Department for transfer for public health purposes will 
be based on the following conditions:

    (2) The applicant is willing, authorized, and in a position to 
assume immediate care, custody, and maintenance of the property.
    (3) The applicant is able, willing and authorized to pay the 
administrative expenses incident to the transfer.
    (4) The applicant has the necessary funds, or the ability to obtain 
such funds, to carry out the approved program of use of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 12.9  General disposal terms and conditions.

    (a) Surplus real property transfers under this part will be limited 
to public health purposes. Transferees shall be entitled to a public 
benefit allowance in terms of a percentage which will be applied against 
the value of the property to be conveyed. Such an allowance will be 
computed on the basis of benefits to the United States from the use of 
such property for public health purposes. The computation of such public 
benefit allowances will be in accordance with Exhibit A attached hereto 
and made a part hereof.
    (b) A transfer of surplus real property for public health purposes 
is subject to the disapproval of the Administrator within 30 days after 
notice is given to him of the proposed transfer.
    (c) Transfers will be on the following terms and conditions:
    (1) The transferee will be obligated to utilize the property 
continuously in accordance with an approved plan of operation.
    (2) The transferee will not be permitted to sell, lease or sublease, 
rent, mortgage, encumber, or otherwise dispose of the property, or any 
part thereof, without the prior written authorization of the Department.
    (3) The transferee will file with the Department such reports 
covering the utilization of the property as may be required.
    (4) In the event the property is sold, leased or subleased, 
encumbered, disposed of, or is used for purposes other than those set 
forth in the approved plan without the consent of the Department, all 
revenues or the reasonable value of other benefits received by the 
transferee directly or indirectly from such use, as determined by the 
Department, will be considered to have been received and held in trust 
by the transferee for the account of the United States and will be 
subject to the direction and control of the Department. The provisions 
of this paragraph shall not impair or affect the rights reserved to the 
United States in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, or the right of the 
Department to impose conditions to its consent.
    (5) Lessees will be required to carry all perils and liability 
insurance to

[[Page 51]]

protect the Government and the Government's residual interest in the 
property. Transferees will be required to carry such flood insurance as 
may be required by the Department pursuant to Pub. L. 93-234. Where the 
transferee elects to carry insurance against damages to or loss of on-
site property due to fire or other hazards, and where loss or damage to 
transferred Federal surplus real property occurs, all proceeds from 
insurance shall be promptly used by the transferee for the purpose of 
repairing and restoring the property to its former condition, or 
replacing it with equivalent or more suitable facilities. If not so 
used, there shall be paid to the United States that part of the 
insurance proceeds that is attributable to the Government's residual 
interest in the property lost, damaged, or destroyed in the case of 
leases, attributable to the fair market value of the leased facilities.
    (6) With respect to on-site property, in the event of noncompliance 
with any of the conditions of the transfer as determined by the 
Department, title to the property transferred and the right to immediate 
possession shall, at the option of the Department, revert to the 
Government. In the event title is reverted to the United States for 
noncompliance or voluntarily reconveyed, the transferee shall, at the 
option of the Department, be required to reimburse the Government for 
the decrease in value of the property not due to reasonable wear and 
tear or acts of God or attributable to alterations completed by the 
transferee to adapt the property to the public health use for which the 
property was transferred. With respect to leased property, in the event 
of noncompliance with any of the conditions of the lease, as determined 
by the Department, the right of occupancy and possession shall, at the 
option of the Department, be terminated. In the event a leasehold is 
terminated by the United States for noncompliance or is voluntarily 
surrendered, the lessee shall be required at the option of the 
Department to reimburse the Government for the decrease in value of the 
property not due to reasonable wear and tear or acts of God or 
attributable to alterations completed by the lessee to adapt the 
property to the public health use for which the property was leased.

With respect to any reverter of title or termination of leasehold 
resulting from noncompliance, the Government shall, in addition thereto, 
be reimbursed for such costs as may be incurred in recovering title to 
or possession of the property.


Any payments of cash made by the transferee against the purchase price 
of property transferred shall, upon a forfeiture of title to the 
property for breach of condition, be forfeited.
    (7) With respect to off-site property, in the event of noncompliance 
with any of the terms and conditions of the transfer, the unearned 
public benefit allowance shall, at the option of the Department, become 
immediately due and payable or, if the property or any portion thereof 
is sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of without authorization from the 
Department, such sale, lease or sublease, or other disposal shall be for 
the benefit and account of the United States and the United States shall 
be entitled to the proceeds. In the event the transferee fails to remove 
the property or any portion thereof within the time specified, then in 
addition to the rights reserved above, at the option of the Department, 
all right, title, and interest in and to such unremoved property shall 
be retransferred to other eligible applicants or shall be forfeited to 
the United States.
    (8) With respect only to on-site property which has been declared 
excess by the Department of Defense, such declaration having included a 
statement indicating the property has a known potential for use during a 
national emergency, the Department shall reserve the right during any 
period of emergency declared by the President of the United States or by 
the Congress of the United States to the full and unrestricted use by 
the Government of the surplus real property, or of any portion thereof, 
disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this part. Such use may 
be either exclusive or nonexclusive. Prior to the expiration or 
termination of the period of restricted use by the transferee, the 
Government will not be obligated to pay rent or any other fees or 
charges during the period

[[Page 52]]

of emergency, except that the Government will:
    (i) Bear the entire cost of maintenance of such portion of the 
property used by it exclusively or over which it may have exclusive 
possession or control;
    (ii) Pay the fair share, commensurate with the use of the cost of 
maintenance of such surplus real property as it may use nonexclusively 
or over which it may have nonexclusive possession or control;
    (iii) Pay a fair rental for the use of improvements or additions to 
the surplus real property made by the purchaser or lessee without 
Government aid; and
    (iv) Be responsible for any damage to the surplus real property 
caused by its use, reasonable wear and tear, the common enemy and acts 
of God excepted. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of the 
period of restricted use, the obligations of the Government will be as 
set forth in the preceding sentence and, in addition, the Government 
shall be obligated to pay a fair rental for all or any portion of the 
conveyed premises which it uses.
    (9) The restrictions set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (7) of 
this section will extend for thirty (30) years for land with or without 
improvements; and for facilities being acquired separately from land 
whether they are for use on-site or off-site, the period of limitations 
on the use of the structures will be equal to their estimated economic 
life. The restrictions set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (7) of 
this section will extend for the entire initial lease period and for any 
renewal periods for property leased from the Department.
    (d) Transferees, by obtaining the consent of the Department, may 
abrogate the restrictions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for 
all or any portion of the property upon payment in cash to the 
Department of an amount equal to the then current fair market value of 
the property to be released, multiplied by the public benefit allowance 
granted at the time of conveyance, divided by the total number of months 
of the period of restriction set forth in the conveyance document and 
multiplied by the number of months that remain in the period of 
restriction as determined by the Department. For purposes of abrogation 
payment computation, the current fair market value shall not include the 
value of any improvements placed on the property by the transferee.
    (e) Related personal property will be transferred or leased as a 
part of the realty and in accordance with real property procedures. It 
will be subject to the same public benefit allowance granted for the 
real property. Where related personal property is involved in an on-site 
transfer, the related personal property may be transferred by a bill of 
sale imposing restrictions for a period not to exceed five years from 
the date of transfer, other terms and conditions to be the same as, and 
made a part of, the real property transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 12.10  Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and 
other related Acts (environmental impact).

    (a) The Department will, prior to making a final decision to convey 
or lease, or to amend, reform, or grant an approval or release with 
respect to a previous conveyance or lease of, surplus real property for 
public health purposes, complete an environmental assessment of the 
proposed transaction in keeping with applicable provisions of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Historic 
Preservation Act of 1966, the National Archeological Data Preservation 
Act, and other related acts. No permit to use surplus real property 
shall allow the permittee to make, or cause to be made, any irreversible 
change in the condition of said property, and no use permit shall be 
employed for the purpose of delaying or avoiding compliance with the 
requirements of these Acts.
    (b) Applicants shall be required to provide such information as the 
Department deems necessary to make an assessment of the impact of the 
proposed Federal action on the human environment. Materials contained in 
the applicant's official request, responses to a standard questionnaire 
prescribed by the Public Health Service, as well as other relevant 
information, will be

[[Page 53]]

used by the Department in making said assessment.
    (c) If the assessment reveals (1) That the proposed Federal action 
involves properties of historical significance which are listed, or 
eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places, or 
(2) that a more than insignificant impact on the human environment is 
reasonably foreseeable as a result of the proposed action, or (3) that 
the proposed Federal action could result in irreparable loss or 
destruction of archeologically significant items or data, the Department 
will, except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, prepare 
and distribute, or cause to be prepared or distributed, such notices and 
statements and obtain such approvals as are required by the above cited 
Acts.
    (d) If a proposed action involves other Federal agencies in a 
sequence of actions, or a group of actions, directly related to each 
other because of their functional interdependence, the Department may 
enter into and support a lead agency agreement to designate a single 
lead agency which will assume primary responsibility for coordinating 
the assessment of environmental effects of proposed Federal actions, 
preparing and distributing such notices and statements, or obtaining 
such approvals, as are required by the above cited Acts. The procedures 
of the designated lead agency will be utilized in conducting the 
environmental assessment. In the event of disagreement between the 
Department and another Federal agency, the Department will reserve the 
right to abrogate its lead agency agreement with the other Federal 
Agency.

the agencies under section 202 of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 483), Executive Order 12512, and

landholding agency shall submit a revised property checklist in response 
to the next quarterly canvass. HUD will make a new determination of 
suitability and, if it differs from the previous determination, 
republish the property information in the Federal Register. For example, 
property determined unsuitable for national security concerns may no 
longer be subject to security restrictions, or property determined 
suitable may subsequently be found to be contaminated.


<R05>
Sec. 12a.4  Suitability determination.

    (a) Suitability determination. Within 30 days after the receipt of 
information from landholding agencies regarding properties which were 
reported pursuant to the canvass described in Sec. 12a.3(a), HUD will 
determine, under criteria set forth in Sec. 12a.6, which properties are 
suitable for use as facilities to assist the homeless and report its 
determination to the landholding agency. Properties that are under 
lease, contract, license, or agreement by which a Federal agency retains 
a real property interest or which are scheduled to become unutilized or 
underutilized will be reviewed for suitability no earlier than six 
months prior to the expected date when the property will become 
unutilized or underutilized, except that properties subject to the Base 
Closure and Realignment Act may be reviewed up to eighteen months prior 
to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or 
underutilized.
    (b) Scope of suitability. HUD will determine the suitability of a 
property for use as a facility to assist the homeless without regard to 
any particular use.
    (c) Environmental information. HUD will evaluate the environmental 
information contained in property checklists forwarded to HUD by the 
landholding agencies solely for the purpose of determining suitability 
of properties under the criteria in Sec. 12a.6.
    (d) Written record of suitability determination. HUD will assign an 
identification number to each property reviewed for suitability. HUD 
will maintain a written public record of the following:
    (1) The suitability determination for a particular piece of 
property, and the reasons for that determination; and
    (2) The landholding agency's response to the determination pursuant 
to the requirements of Sec. 12a.7(a).
    (e) Property determined unsuitable. Property that is reviewed by HUD 
under this section and that is determined unsuitable for use to assist 
the homeless may not be made available

[[Page 59]]

for any other purpose for 20 days after publication in the Federal 
Register of a Notice of unsuitability to allow for review of the 
determination at the request of a representative of the homeless.
    (f) Procedures for appealing unsuitability determinations. (1) To 
request review of a determination of unsuitability, a representative of 
the homeless must contact HUD within 20 days of publication of notice in 
the Federal Register that a property is unsuitable. Requests may be 
submitted to HUD in writing or by calling 1-800-927-7588 (Toll Free). 
Written requests must be received no later than 20 days after notice of 
unsuitability is published in the Federal Register.
    (2) Requests for review of a determination of unsuitability may be 
made only by representatives of the homeless, as defined in Sec. 12a.1.
    (3) The request for review must specify the grounds on which it is 
based, i.e., that HUD has improperly applied the criteria or that HUD 
has relied on incorrect or incomplete information in making the 
determination (e.g., that property is in a floodplain but not in a 
floodway).
    (4) Upon receipt of a request to review a determination of 
unsuitability, HUD will notify the landholding agency that such a 
request has been made, request that the agency respond with any 
information pertinent to the review, and advise the agency that it 
should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has 
completed its reconsideration regarding unsuitability.
    (i) HUD will act on all requests for review within 30 days of 
receipt of the landholding agency's response and will notify the 
representative of the homeless and the landholding agency in writing of 
its decision.
    (ii) If a property is determined suitable as a result of the review, 
HUD will request the landholding agency's determination of availability 
pursuant to Sec. 12a.7(a), upon receipt of which HUD will promptly 
publish the determination in the Federal Register. If the determination 
of unsuitability stands, HUD will inform the representative of the 
homeless of its decision.


<R05>
Sec. 12a.5  Real property reported excess to GSA.

    (a) Each landholding agency must submit a report to GSA of 
properties it determines excess. Each landholding agency must also 
provide a copy of HUD's suitability determination, if any, including 
HUD's identification number for the property.
    (b) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has been 
reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability and HUD determined 
the property suitable, GSA will screen the property pursuant to Sec. 
12a.5(g) and will advise HUD of the availability of the property for use 
by the homeless as provided in Sec. 12a.5(e). In lieu of the above, GSA 
may submit a new checklist to HUD and follow the procedures in Sec. 
12a.5(c) through Sec. 12a.5(g).
    (c) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has not 
been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability, GSA will 
complete a property checklist, based on information provided by the 
landholding agency, and will forward this checklist to HUD for a 
suitability determination. This checklist will reflect any change in 
classification, i.e., from unutilized or underutilized to excess.
    (d) Within 30 days after GSA's submission, HUD will advise GSA of 
the suitability determination.
    (e) When GSA receives a letter from HUD listing suitable excess 
properties in GSA's inventory, GSA will transmit to HUD within 45 days a 
response which includes the following for each identified property:
    (1) A statement that there is no other compelling Federal need for 
the property, and therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or
    (2) A statement that there is further and compelling Federal need 
for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, 
therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the 
homeless.
    (f) When an excess property is determined suitable and available and 
notice is published in the Federal Register, GSA will concurrently 
notify HHS, HUD, State and local government units, known homeless 
assistance providers that have expressed interest in

[[Page 60]]

the particular property, and other organizations, as appropriate, 
concerning suitable properties.
    (g) Upon submission of a Report of Excess to GSA, GSA may screen the 
property for Federal use. In addition, GSA may screen State and local 
governmental units and eligible nonprofit organizations to determine 
interest in the property in accordance with current regulations. (See 41 
CFR 101-47.203-5, 101-47.204-1 and 101-47.303-2.)
    (h) The landholding agency will retain custody and accountability 
and will protect and maintain any property which is reported excess to 
GSA as provided in 41 CFR 101-47.402.


<R05>
Sec. 12a.6  Suitability criteria.

    (a) All properties, buildings and land will be determined suitable 
unless a property's characteristics include one or more of the following 
conditions:
    (1) National security concerns. A property located in an area to 
which the general public is denied access in the interest of national 
security (e.g., where a special pass or security clearance is a 
condition of entry to the property) will be determined unsuitable. Where 
alternative access can be provided for the public without compromising 
national security, the property will not be determined unsuitable on 
this basis.
    (2) Property containing flammable or explosive materials. A property 
located within 2000 feet of an industrial, commercial or Federal 
facility handling flammable or explosive material (excluding underground 
storage) will be determined unsuitable. Above ground containers with a 
capacity of 100 gallons or less, or larger containers which provide the 
heating or power source for the property, and which meet local safety, 
operation, and permitting standards, will not affect whether a 
particular property is determined suitable or unsuitable. Underground 
storage, gasoline stations and tank trucks are not included in this 
category and their presence will not be the basis of an unsuitability 
determination unless there is evidence of a threat to personal safety as 
provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (3) Runway clear zone and military airfield clear zone. A property 
located within an airport runway clear zone or military airfield clear 
zone will be determined unsuitable.
    (4) Floodway. A property located in the floodway of a 100 year 
floodplain will be determined unsuitable. If the floodway has been 
contained or corrected, or if only an incidental portion of the property 
not affecting the use of the remainder of the property is in the 
floodway, the property will not be determined unsuitable.
    (5) Documented deficiencies. A property with a documented and 
extensive condition(s) that represents a clear threat to personal 
physical safety will be determined unsuitable. Such conditions may 
include, but are not limited to, contamination, structural damage or 
extensive deterioration, friable asbestos, PCB's, or natural hazardous 
substances such as radon, periodic flooding, sinkholes or earth slides.
    (6) Inaccessible. A property that is inaccessible will be determined 
unsuitable. An inaccessible property is one that is not accessible by 
road (including property on small off-shore islands) or is land locked 
(e.g., can be reached only by crossing private property and there is no 
established right or means of entry).


<R05>
Sec. 12a.7  Determination of availability.

    (a) Within 45 days after receipt of a letter from HUD pursuant to 
Sec. 12a.4(a), each landholding agency must transmit to HUD a statement 
of one of the following:
    (1) In the case of unutilized or underutilized property:
    (i) An intention to declare the property excess,
    (ii) An intention to make the property available for use to assist 
the homeless, or
    (iii) The reasons why the property cannot be declared excess or made 
available for use to assist the homeless. The reasons given must be 
different than those listed as suitability criteria in Sec. 12a.6.
    (2) In the case of excess property which had previously been 
reported to GSA:
    (i) A statement that there is no compelling Federal need for the 
property, and that, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; 
or

[[Page 61]]

    (ii) A statement that there is a further and compelling Federal need 
for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, 
therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the 
homeless.


<R05>
Sec. 12a.8  Public notice of determination.

    (a) No later than 15 days after the last 45 day period has elapsed 
for receiving responses from the landholding agencies regarding 
availability, HUD will publish in the Federal Register a list of all 
properties reviewed, including a description of the property, its 
address, and classification. The following designations will be made:
    (1) Properties that are suitable and available.
    (2) Properties that are suitable and unavailable.
    (3) Properties that are suitable and to be declared excess.
    (4) Properties that are unsuitable.
    (b) Information about specific properties can be obtained by 
contacting HUD at the following toll free number, 1-800-927-7588.
    (c) HUD will transmit to the ICH a copy of the list of all 
properties published in the Federal Register. The ICH will immediately 
distribute to all state and regional homeless coordinators area-relevant 
portions of the list. The ICH will encourage the state and regional 
homeless coordinators to disseminate this information widely.
    (d) No later than February 15 of each year, HUD shall publish in the 
Federal Register a list of all properties reported pursuant to Sec. 
12a.3(b).
    (e) HUD shall publish an annual list of properties determined 
suitable but which agencies reported unavailable including the reasons 
such properties are not available.
    (f) Copies of the lists published in the Federal Register will be 
available for review by the public in the HUD headquarters building 
library (room 8141); area-relevant portions of the lists will be 
available in the HUD regional offices and in major field offices.


<R05>
Sec. 12a.9  Application process.

    (a) Holding period. (1) Properties published as available for 
application for use to assist the homeless shall not be available for 
any other purpose for a period of 60 days beginning on the date of 
publication. Any representative of the homeless interested in any 
underutilized, unutilized, excess or surplus Federal property for use as 
a facility to assist the homeless must send to HHS a written expression 
of interest in that property within 60 days after the property has been 
published in the Federal Register.
    (2) If a written expression of interest to apply for suitable 
property for use to assist the homeless is received by HHS within the 60 
day holding period, such property may not be made available for any 
other purpose until the date HHS or the appropriate landholding agency 
has completed action on the application submitted pursuant to that 
expression of interest.
    (3) The expression of interest should identify the specific 
property, briefly describe the proposed use, include the name of the 
organization, and indicate whether it is a public body or a private non-
profit organization. The expression of interest must be sent to the 
Division of Health Facilities Planning (DHFP) of the Department of 
Health and Human Services at the following address:

Director, Division of Health Facilities Planning, Public Health Service, 
Room 17A-10, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 
20857.


HHS will notify the landholding agency (for unutilized and underutilized 
properties) or GSA (for excess and surplus properties) when an 
expression of interest has been received for a particular property.
    (4) An expression of interest may be sent to HHS any time after the 
60 day holding period has expired. In such a case, an application 
submitted pursuant to this expression of interest may be approved for 
use by the homeless if:
    (i) No application or written expression of interest has been made 
under any law for use of the property for any purpose; and
    (ii) In the case of excess or surplus property, GSA has not received 
a bona fide offer to purchase that property or advertised for the sale 
of the property by public auction.

[[Page 62]]

    (b) Application Requirements. Upon receipt of an expression of 
interest, DHFP will send an application packet to the interested entity. 
The application packet requires the applicant to provide certain 
information, including the following--
    (1) Description of the applicant organization. The applicant must 
document that it satisfies the definition of a ``representative of the 
homeless,'' as specified in Sec. 12a.1 of this subpart. The applicant 
must document its authority to hold real property. Private non-profit 
organizations applying for deeds must document that they are section 
501(c)(3) tax-exempt.
    (2) Description of the property desired. The applicant must describe 
the property desired and indicate that any modifications made to the 
property will conform to local use restrictions except for local zoning 
regulations.
    (3) Description of the proposed program. The applicant must fully 
describe the proposed program and demonstrate how the program will 
address the needs of the homeless population to be assisted. The 
applicant must fully describe what modifications will be made to the 
property before the program becomes operational.
    (4) Ability to finance and operate the proposed program. The 
applicant must specifically describe all anticipated costs and sources 
of funding for the proposed program. The applicant must indicate that it 
can assume care, custody, and maintenance of the property and that it 
has the necessary funds or the ability to obtain such funds to carry out 
the approved program of use for the property.
    (5) Compliance with non-discrimination requirements. Each applicant 
and lessee under this part must certify in writing that it will comply 
with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and 
implementing regulations; and as applicable, Executive Order 11063 
(Equal Opportunity in Housing) and implementing regulations; title VI of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to d-4) (Nondiscrimination 
in Federally Assisted Programs) and implementing regulations; the 
prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age 
Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) and implementing 
regulations; and the prohibitions against otherwise qualified 
individuals with handicaps under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations. The applicant must 
state that it will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, 
national origin, religion, sex, age, familial status, or handicap in the 
use of the property, and will maintain the required records to 
demonstrate compliance with Federal laws.
    (6) Insurance. The applicant must certify that it will insure the 
property against loss, damage, or destruction in accordance with the 
requirements of 45 CFR 12.9.
    (7) Historic preservation. Where applicable, the applicant must 
provide information that will enable HHS to comply with Federal historic 
preservation requirements.
    (8) Environmental information. The applicant must provide sufficient 
information to allow HHS to analyze the potential impact of the 
applicant's proposal on the environment, in accordance with the 
instructions provided with the application packet. HHS will assist 
applicants in obtaining any pertinent environmental information in the 
possession of HUD, GSA, or the landholding agency.
    (9) Local government notification. The applicant must indicate that 
it has informed the applicable unit of general local government 
responsible for providing sewer, water, police, and fire services, in 
writing of its proposed program.
    (10) Zoning and Local Use Restrictions. The applicant must indicate 
that it will comply with all local use restrictions, including local 
building code requirements. Any applicant which applies for a lease or 
permit for a particular property is not required to comply with local 
zoning requirements. Any applicant applying for a deed of a particular 
property, pursuant to Sec. 12a. 9(b)(3), must comply with local zoning 
requirements, as specified in 45 CFR part 12.
    (c) Scope of evaluations. Due to the short time frame imposed for 
evaluating applications, HHS' evaluation will, generally, be limited to 
the information contained in the application.

[[Page 63]]

    (d) Deadline. Completed applications must be received by DHFP, at 
the above address, within 90 days after an expression of interest is 
received from a particular applicant for that property. Upon written 
request from the applicant, HHS may grant extensions, provided that the 
appropriate landholding agency concurs with the extension. Because each 
applicant will have a different deadline based on the date the applicant 
submitted an expression of interest, applicants should contact the 
individual landholding agency to confirm that a particular property 
remains available prior to submitting an application.
    (e) Evaluations. (1) Upon receipt of an application, HHS will review 
it for completeness, and, if incomplete, may return it or ask the 
applicant to furnish any missing or additional required information 
prior to final evaluation of the application.
    (2) HHS will evaluate each completed application within 25 days of 
receipt and will promptly advise the applicant of its decision. 
Applications are evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis. HHS will 
notify all organizations which have submitted expressions of interest 
for a particular property regarding whether the first application 
received for that property has been approved or disapproved. All 
applications will be reviewed on the basis of the following elements, 
which are listed in descending order of priority, except that paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iv) and (e)(2)(v) of this section are of equal importance.
    (i) Services offered. The extent and range of proposed services, 
such as meals, shelter, job training, and counseling.
    (ii) Need. The demand for the program and the degree to which the 
available property will be fully utilized.
    (iii) Implementation Time. The amount of time necessary for the 
proposed program to become operational.
    (iv) Experience. Demonstrated prior success in operating similar 
programs and recommendations attesting to that fact by Federal, State, 
and local authorities.
    (v) Financial Ability. The adequacy of funding that will likely be 
available to run the program fully and properly and to operate the 
facility.
    (3) Additional evaluation factors may be added as deemed necessary 
by HHS. If additional factors are added, the application packet will be 
revised to include a description of these additional factors.
    (4) If HHS receives one or more competing applications for a 
property within 5 days of the first application HHS will evaluate all 
completed applications simultaneously. HHS will rank approved 
applications based on the elements listed in Sec. 12a.8(e)(2), and 
notify the landholding agency, or GSA, as appropriate, of the relative 
ranks.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0937-0191)


<R05>
Sec. 12a.10  Action on approved applica-tions.

    (a) Unutilized and underutilized properties.
    (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the 
applicant and forward a copy of the application to the landholding 
agency. The landholding agency will execute the lease, or permit 
document, as appropriate, in consultation with the applicant.
    (2) The landholding agency maintains the discretion to decide the 
following:
    (i) The length of time the property will be available. (Leases and 
permits will be for a period of at least one year unless the applicant 
requests a shorter term.)
    (ii) Whether to grant use of the property via a lease or permit;
    (iii) The terms and conditions of the lease or permit document.
    (b) Excess and surplus properties. (1) When HHS approves an 
application, it will so notify the applicant and request that GSA assign 
the property to HHS for leasing. Upon receipt of the assignment, HHS 
will execute a lease in accordance with the procedures and requirements 
set out in 45 CFR part 12. In accordance with 41 CFR 101-47.402, custody 
and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term 
with the agency which initially reported the property as excess.
    (2) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses 
and

[[Page 64]]

other important national needs; however, in deciding the disposition of 
surplus real property, GSA will generally give priority of consideration 
to uses to assist the homeless. GSA may consider any competing request 
for the property made under section 203(k) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(k)) that is so 
meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the needs of the homeless, 
and HHS may likewise consider any competing request made under 
subsection 203(k)(1) of that law.
    (3) Whenever GSA or HHS decides in favor of a competing request over 
a request for property for homeless assistance use as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the agency making the decision will 
transmit to the appropriate committees of the Congress an explanatory 
statement which details the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus 
property, and the reasons for determining that such need was so 
meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.
    (4) Deeds. Surplus property may be conveyed to representatives of 
the homeless pursuant to section 203(k) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(1), and section 
501(f) of the McKinney Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 11411. Representatives 
of the homeless must complete the application packet pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 12a.9 of this part and in accordance with the 
requirements of 45 CFR part 12.
    (c) Completion of Lease Term and Reversion of Title. Lessees and 
grantees will be responsible for the protection and maintenance of the 
property during the time that they possess the property. Upon 
termination of the lease term or reversion of title to the Federal 
government, the lessee or grantee will be responsible for removing any 
improvements made to the property and will be responsible for 
restoration of the property. If such improvements are not removed, they 
will become the property of the Federal government. GSA or the 
landholding agency, as appropriate, will assume responsibility for 
protection and maintenance of a property when the lease terminates or 
title reverts.


<R05>
Sec. 12a.11  Unsuitable properties.

    The landholding agency will defer, for 20 days after the date that 
notice of a property is published in the Federal Register, action to 
dispose of properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance. HUD 
will inform landholding agencies or GSA if appeal of an unsuitability 
determination is filed by a representative of the homeless pursuant to 
Sec. 12a.4(f)(4). HUD will advise the agency that it should refrain from 
initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its 
reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no 
appeal has been filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding 
agency may proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable 
law.


<R05>
Sec. 12a.12  No applications approved.

    (a) At the end of the 60 day holding period described in Sec. 
12a.9(a), HHS will notify GSA, or the landholding agency, as 
appropriate, if an expression of interest has been received for a 
particular property. Where there is no expression of interest, GSA or 
the landholding agency, as appropriate, will proceed with disposal in 
accordance with applicable law.
    (b) Upon advice from HHS that all applications have been 
disapproved, or if no completed applications or requests for extensions 
have been received by HHS within 90 days from the date of the last 
expression of interest, disposal may proceed in accordance with 
applicable law.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 13.1  Purpose of these rules.

    These rules implement section 203 of the Equal Access to Justice 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 and 504 note, for the Department of Health and Human 
Services. They describe the circumstances under which the Department may 
award attorney fees and certain other expenses to eligible individuals 
and entities who prevail over the Department in certain administrative 
proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications''). The Department may 
reimburse parties for expenses incurred in adversary adjudications if 
the party prevails in the proceeding and if the Department's position in 
the proceeding was not substantially justified. These rules explain how 
to apply for an award. They also describe what proceedings constitute 
adversary adjudications covered by the Act, what types of persons and 
entities may be eligible for an award, and what procedures and standards 
the Department will use to make a determination as to whether a party 
may receive an award.


<R05>
Sec. 13.2  When these rules apply.

    These rules apply to adversary adjudications pending before the 
Department between October 1, 1981 and September 30, 1984.


<R05>
Sec. 13.3  Proceedings covered.

    (a) These rules apply only to adversary adjudications. For the 
purpose of these rules, only an adjudication required to be under 5 
U.S.C. 554, in which the position of the Department or one of its 
components is represented by an attorney or other representative (``the 
agency's litigating party'') who enters an appearance and participates 
in the proceeding, constitutes an adversary adjudication. These rules do 
not apply to proceedings for the purpose of establishing or fixing a 
rate or for the purpose of granting, denying, or renewing a license. 
Department proceedings covered by these rules, if the agency's 
litigating party enters an appearance and participates, are listed in 
Appendix A.
    (b) If a proceeding is covered by these rules, but also involves 
issues excluded under paragraph (a) of this section from the coverage of 
these rules, reimbursement is available only for fees and expenses 
resulting from covered issues.


<R05>
Sec. 13.4  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under these regulations, the applicant must be a party, as defined in 5 
U.S.C. 551(3), to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an 
award. An applicant must show that it meets all conditions of 
eligibility set out in this subpart and in Subpart B.
    (b) The categories of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) Individuals with a net worth of not more than $1 million;
    (2) Sole owners of unincorporated businesses if the owner has a net 
worth of not more than $5 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) Charitable or other tax-exempt organizations described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) Cooperative associations as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees, and
    (5) All other partnerships, corporations, associations or public or 
private organizations with a net worth of not

[[Page 66]]

more than $5 million and with not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of determining eligibility, the net worth and 
number of employees of an applicant is calculated as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated. The net worth of an applicant is determined by 
generally accepted accounting principles.
    (d) Whether an applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' or a ``sole owner of an unincorporated 
business'' will be determined by whether the applicant's participation 
in the proceeding is related primarily to individual interests or to 
business interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all those persons 
regularly providing services for remuneration for the applicant, under 
the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be 
included on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the 
applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant is not eligible if it appears from the facts and 
circumstances that it has participated in the proceedings only or 
primarily on behalf of other persons or entities that are ineligible.


<R05>
Sec. 13.5  Standards for awards.

    (a) Awards will not be made for fees and expenses where the 
Department's position in the proceeding was substantially justified at 
the time the proceeding was initiated. The fact that a party has 
prevailed in a proceeding does not create a presumption that the 
Department's position was not substantially justified. The burden of 
proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing 
applicant is on the agency's litigating party, which may avoid an award 
by showing that its position was reasonable in law and fact.
    (b) When two or more matters are joined together for one hearing, 
each of which could have been heard separately (without regard to laws 
or rules fixing a jurisdictional minimum amount for claims), and an 
applicant has prevailed with respect to one or several of the matters, 
an eligible applicant may receive an award for expenses associated only 
with the matters on which it prevailed if the Department's position on 
those matters was not substantially justified.
    (c) Awards for fees and expenses incurred before the date on which a 
proceeding was initiated will be made only if the applicant can 
demonstrate that they were reasonably incurred in preparation for the 
proceeding.
    (d) Awards will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or 
unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if other special circumstances 
make an award unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 13.6  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be limited to the rates customarily charged by 
persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and 
expert witnesses. Awards will not be made for more than the applicant's 
actual expenses. If a party has already received, or is eligible to 
receive, reimbursement for any expenses under another statutory 
provision or another program allowing reimbursement, its award under 
these rules must be reduced by the amount the prevailing party has 
already received, or is eligible to receive, from the Federal 
government.
    (b) An award for the fees of an attorney or agent may not exceed 
$75.00 per hour, regardless of the actual rate charged by the attorney 
or agent. An award for the fees of an expert witness

[[Page 67]]

may not exceed the highest rate at which the Department pays expert 
witnesses, which is $24.09 per hour, regardless of the actual rates 
charged by the witness. These limits apply only to fees; an award may 
include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a 
separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges 
separately for such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fees sought for 
attorneys, agents or expert witnesses, the adjudicative officer must 
consider factors bearing on the request, which include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for like services; if the attorney, agent or witness 
is an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of service;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.


<R05>
Sec. 13.7  Studies, exhibits, analyses, engineering reports, tests and projects.

    The reasonable cost (or the reasonable portion of the cost) for any 
study, exhibit, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar 
matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded to the extent that:
    (a) The charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate 
payable for similar services,
    (b) The study or other matter was necessary to the preparation for 
the administrative proceeding, and
    (c) The study or other matter was prepared for use in connection 
with the administrative proceeding. No award will be made for a study or 
other matter which was necessary to satisfy statutory or regulatory 
requirements, or which would ordinarily be conducted as part of the 
party's business irrespective of the administrative proceeding.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Information Required from Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 13.10  Contents of application.

    (a) Applications for an award of fees and expenses must include:
    (1) The name of the applicant and the identification of the 
proceeding;
    (2) A declaration that the applicant believes it has prevailed, and 
an identification of the position of the Department that the applicant 
alleges was not substantially justified at the time of the initiation of 
the proceeding;
    (3) Unless the applicant is an individual, a statement of the number 
of its employees on the date on which the proceeding was initiated, and 
a brief description of the type and purpose of its organization or 
business;
    (4) A description of any affiliated individuals or entities, as the 
term ``affiliate'' is defined in Sec. 13.4(f), or a statement that none 
exist;
    (5) A statement that the applicant's net worth as of the date on 
which the proceeding was initiated did not exceed $1 million (if an 
individual) or $5 million (for all other applicants, including their 
affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (i) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualified under 
such section; or
    (ii) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a));
    (6) A statement of the amount of fees and expenses for which an 
award is sought;
    (7) A declaration that the applicant has not received, has not 
applied for, and does not intend to apply for reimbursement of the cost 
of items listed in the Statement of Fees and Expenses under any other 
program or statute; or if the applicant has received or applied for or 
will receive or apply for reimbursement of those expenses under another 
program or statute, a statement

[[Page 68]]

of the amount of reimbursement received or applied for or intended to be 
applied for; and
    (8) Any other matters the applicant wishes the Department to 
consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be 
made.
    (b) All applications must be signed by the applicant or by an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

<R05>
Sec. 13.11  Net worth exhibits.

    (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 13.4(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. 
If any individual, corporation, or other entity directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or if the applicant directly or indirectly owns or 
controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest of any 
corporation or other entity, the exhibit must include a showing of the 
net worth of all such affiliates or of the applicant including the 
affiliates. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative 
officer may require an applicant to file additional information to 
determine its eligibility for an award.
    (b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets 
from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, 
occurring in the one year period prior to the date on which the 
proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant 
and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling. If there were 
no such transactions, the applicant shall so state.
    (c) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a 
sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the 
information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is 
not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be 
served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant 
seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the 
proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information 
should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public 
record of the proceeding. Otherwise, the officer will omit the material 
from the public record. In that case, any decision regarding disclosure 
of the material (whether in response to a request from an agency or 
person outside the Department or on the Department's own initiative) 
will be made in accordance with applicable statutes and Department rules 
and procedures for commercial and financial records which the submitter 
claims are confidential or privileged. In particular, this regulation is 
not a basis for a promise or obligation of confidentiality.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0990-0118)


<R05>
Sec. 13.12  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    (a) All applicants must be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, exhibit, analysis, 
report, test or other similar item, for which the applicant seeks 
reimbursement.

[[Page 69]]

    (b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from each attorney, 
agent, or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the 
party, stating the actual time expended, the rate at which fees and 
other expenses were computed, a description of the specific services 
performed, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or 
payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the 
services provided. Where the adversary adjudication includes covered 
proceedings (as described in Sec. 13.3) as well as excluded proceedings, 
or two or more matters, each of which could have been heard separately, 
the fees and expenses shall be shown separately for each proceeding or 
matter, and the basis for allocating expenses among the proceedings or 
matters shall be indicated.
    (1) The affidavit shall itemize in detail the services performed by 
the date, number of hours per date and the services performed during 
those hours. In order to establish the hourly rate, the affidavit shall 
state the hourly rate which is billed and paid by the majority of 
clients during the relevant time periods.
    (2) If no hourly rate is paid by the majority of clients because, 
for instance, the attorney or agent represents most clients on a 
contingency basis, the attorney or agent shall provide affidavits from 
two attorneys or agents with similar experience, who perform similar 
work, stating the hourly rate which they bill and are paid by the 
majority of their clients during a comparable time period.
    (c) If the applicant seeks reimbursement of any expenses not covered 
by the affidavit described in paragraph (b), the documentation must also 
include an affidavit describing all such expenses and stating the 
amounts paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or 
entity for the services provided.
    (d) The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide 
vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.

           Subpart C--Procedures for Considering Applications


<R05>
Sec. 13.21  Filing and service of pleadings.

    All pleadings, including applications for an award of fees, answers, 
comments, and other pleadings related to the applications, shall be 
filed in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding and served 
on all other parties and participants, except as provided in Sec. 
13.11(b) of this part concerning confidential financial information.


<R05>
Sec. 13.22  When an application may be filed.

    (a) The applicant must file and serve its application no later than 
30 calendar days after the Department's final disposition of the 
proceeding which makes the applicant a prevailing party.
    (b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later of 
(1) the date on which an initial decision or other recommended 
disposition of the merits of the proceeding by an adjudicative officer 
or intermediate review board becomes administratively final; (2) 
issuance of an order disposing of any petitions for reconsideration of 
the Department's final order in the proceeding; (3) if no petition for 
reconsideration is filed, the last date on which such a petition could 
have been filed; or (4) issuance of a final order or any other final 
resolution of a proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, 
which is not subject to a petition for reconsideration.
    (c) For purposes of this rule, an applicant has prevailed when the 
agency has made a final disposition favorable to the applicant with 
respect to any matter which could have been heard as a separate 
proceeding, regardless of whether it was joined with other matters for 
hearing.
    (d) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.


<R05>
Sec. 13.23  Responsive pleadings.

    (a) Within 30 calendar days after service of the application, the 
agency's

[[Page 70]]

litigating party shall file an answer either consenting to the award or 
explaining in detail any objections to the award requested, and 
identifying the facts relied on in support of its position. The 
adjudicative officer may for good cause grant an extension of time for 
filing an answer.
    (b) Within 15 calendar days after service of an answer, the 
applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts 
not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include 
with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 13.25.
    (c) Any party to or participant in a proceeding may file comments on 
an application within 30 calendar days, or on an answer within 15 
calendar days after service of the application or answer.


<R05>
Sec. 13.24  Settlements.

    The applicant and the agency's litigating party may agree on a 
proposed settlement of the award at any time prior to final action on 
the application. If the parties agree on a proposed settlement of an 
award before an application has been filed, the application shall be 
filed with the proposed settlement. All settlements must be approved by 
the adjudicative officer and the head of the agency or office or his or 
her designee before becoming final.


<R05>
Sec. 13.25  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, a decision on an application will be made on the 
basis of the hearing record and pleadings related to the application. 
However, at the request of either the applicant or the agency's 
litigating party, or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative 
officer may order further proceedings, including an informal conference, 
oral argument, additional written submissions, or an evidentiary 
hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for 
full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and 
shall be conducted as promptly as possible.
    (b) A request that the adjudicative officer order additional written 
submissions or oral testimony shall identify the information sought and 
shall explain why the information is necessary to decide the issues.
    (c) The adjudicative officer may impose sanctions on any party for 
failure to comply with his or her order to file pleadings, produce 
documents, or present witnesses for oral examination. These sanctions 
may include but are not limited to granting the application partly or 
completely, dismissing the application, and diminishing the award 
granted.


<R05>
Sec. 13.26  Decisions.

    The adjudicative officer shall issue an initial decision on the 
application as promptly as possible after the filing of the last 
document or conclusion of the hearing. The decision must include written 
findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a 
prevailing party, including a finding on the net worth of the applicant. 
Where the adjudicative officer has determined under Sec. 13.11(b) that 
the applicant's net worth information is exempted from disclosure under 
the Freedom of Information Act, the finding on net worth shall be kept 
confidential. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on 
whether the agency's position was substantially justified, whether the 
applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, an explanation of any 
difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded, and 
whether any special circumstances make the award unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 13.27  Agency review.

    (a) The head of the agency or office, or his or her designee, shall 
review any award granted under this part whether or not the parties 
request such review, and issue a final decision. No award shall be made 
under this subpart without approval of the head of the agency or office 
or his or her designee.
    (b) If either the applicant or the agency's litigating party seeks 
review of the adjudicative officer's decision on the fee application, it 
shall file and serve exceptions within 30 days after issuance of the 
initial decision. The head of the agency or office or his or her 
designee shall issue a final decision on the application as soon as 
possible or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for 
further proceedings.

[[Page 71]]

Any party that does not file and serve exceptions within the stated time 
limit loses the opportunity to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 13.28  Judicial review.

    Judicial review of final agency decisions on awards may be obtained 
as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 13.29  Payment of award.

    The notification to an applicant of a final decision that an award 
will be made shall contain the name and address of the appropriate 
Departmental finance office that will pay the award. An applicant 
seeking payment of an award shall submit to that finance officer a copy 
of the final decision granting the award, accompanied by a statement 
that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United 
States courts. The Department will pay the amount awarded to the 
applicant within 60 days, unless judicial review of the award or of the 
underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by the 
applicant or any other party to the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 13.30  Designation of adjudicative officer.

    Upon the filing of an application pursuant to Sec. 13.11(a), the 
officer who presided over the taking of evidence in the proceeding which 
gave rise to the application will, if available, be automatically 
designated as the adjudicative officer for the handling of the 
application.

Sec. 16.3  When these procedures become available.

    Before the Board will take an appeal, three circumstances must be 
present:
    (a) The dispute must arise under a program which uses the Board for 
dispute resolution, and must meet any special conditions established for 
that program. An explanation is contained in Appendix A.
    (b) The appellant must have received a final written decision, and 
must appeal that decision within 30 days after receiving it. Details of 
how final decisions are developed and issued, and what must be in them, 
are contained in 45 CFR 74.304.

[[Page 73]]

    (c) The appellant must have exhausted any preliminary appeal process 
required by regulation. For example, see 42 CFR part 50 (subpart D) for 
Public Health Service programs. In such cases, the final written 
decision required for the Board's review is the decision resulting from 
the preliminary review or appeal process. Appendix A contains further 
details.

[46 FR 43817, Aug. 31, 1981, as amended at 62 FR 38218, July 17, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 16.4  Summary of procedures below.

    The Board's basic process is review of a written record (which both 
parties are given ample opportunity to develop), consisting of relevant 
documents and statements submitted by both parties (see Sec. 16.8). In 
addition, the Board may hold an informal conference (see Sec. 16.10). 
The informal conference primarily involves questioning of the 
participants by a presiding Board member. Conferences may be conducted 
by telephone conference call. The written record review also may be 
supplemented by a hearing involving an opportunity for examining 
evidence and witnesses, cross-examination, and oral argument (see Sec. 
16.11). A hearing is more expensive and time-consuming than a 
determination on the written record alone or with an informal 
conference. Generally, therefore, the Board will schedule a hearing only 
if the Board determines that there are complex issues or material facts 
in dispute, or that the Board's review would otherwise be significantly 
enhanced by a hearing. Where the amount in dispute is $25,000 or less, 
there are special expedited procedures (see Sec. 16.12 of this part). In 
all cases, the Board has the flexibility to modify procedures to ensure 
fairness, to avoid delay, and to accommodate the peculiar needs of a 
given case. The Board makes maximum feasible use of preliminary informal 
steps to refine issues and to encourage resolution by the parties. The 
Board also has the capability to provide mediation services (see Sec. 
16.18).


<R05>
Sec. 16.5  How the Board operates.

    (a) The Board's professional staff consists of a Chair (who is also 
a Board member) and full- and part-time Board members, all appointed by 
the Secretary; and a staff of employees and consultants who are 
attorneys or persons from other relevant disciplines, such as 
accounting.
    (b) The Chair will assign a Board member to have lead responsibility 
for each case (the ``presiding Board member''). The presiding Board 
member will conduct the conference or hearing, if one is held. Each 
decision of the Board is issued by the presiding Board member and two 
other Board members.
    (c) The Board staff assists the presiding Board member, and may 
request information from the parties; conduct telephone conference calls 
to request information, to clarify issues, or to schedule events; and 
assist in developing decisions and other documents in a case.
    (d) The Chair will assure that no Board or staff member will 
participate in a case where his or her impartiality could reasonably be 
questioned.
    (e) The Board's powers and responsibilities are set forth in Sec. 
16.13.


<R05>
Sec. 16.6  Who represents the parties.

    The appellant's notice of appeal, or the first subsequent submission 
to the Board, should specify the name, address and telephone number of 
the appellant's representative. In its first submission to the Board and 
the appellant, the respondent (i.e., the federal party to the appeal) 
should specify the name, address and telephone number of the 
respondent's representative.


<R05>
Sec. 16.7  The first steps in the appeal process: The notice of appeal 
and the Board's response.

    (a) As explained in 45 CFR 74.304, a prospective appellant must 
submit a notice of appeal to the Board within 30 days after receiving 
the final decision. The notice of appeal must include a copy of the 
final decision, a statement of the amount in dispute in the appeal, and 
a brief statement of why the decision is wrong.
    (b) Within ten days after receiving the notice of appeal, the Board 
will send an acknowledgment, enclose a copy of these procedures, and 
advise the appellant of the next steps. The Board will also send a copy 
of the notice of appeal, its attachments, and the

[[Page 74]]

Board's acknowledgment to the respondent. If the Board Chair has 
determined that the appeal does not meet the conditions of Sec. 16.3 or 
if further information is needed to make this determination, the Board 
will notify the parties at this point.


<R05>
Sec. 16.8  The next step in the appeal process: Preparation of an appeal 
file and written argument.

    Except in expedited cases (generally those of $25,000 or less; see 
Sec. 16.12 for details), the appellant and the respondent each 
participate in developing an appeal file for the Board to review. Each 
also submits written argument in support of its position. The 
responsibilities of each are as follows:
    (a) The appellant's responsibility. Within 30 days after receiving 
the acknowledgment of the appeal, the appellant shall submit the 
following to the Board (with a copy to the respondent):
    (1) An appeal file containing the documents supporting the claim, 
tabbed and organized chronologically and accompanied by an indexed list 
identifying each document. The appellant should include only those 
documents which are important to the Board's decision on the issues in 
the case.
    (2) A written statement of the appellant's argument concerning why 
the respondent's final decision is wrong (appellant's brief).
    (b) The respondent's responsibility. Within 30 days after receiving 
the appellant's submission under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
respondent shall submit the following to the Board (with a copy to the 
appellant):
    (1) A supplement to the appeal file containing any additional 
documents supporting the respondent's position, organized and indexed as 
indicated under paragraph (a) of this section. The respondent should 
avoid submitting duplicates of documents submitted by the appellant.
    (2) A written statement (respondent's brief) responding to the 
appellant's brief.
    (c) The appellant's reply. Within 15 days after receiving the 
respondent's submission, the appellant may submit a short reply. The 
appellant should avoid repeating arguments already made.
    (d) Cooperative efforts. Whenever possible, the parties should try 
to develop a joint appeal file, agree to preparation of the file by one 
of them, agree to facts to eliminate the need for some documents, or 
agree that one party will submit documents identified by the other.
    (e) Voluminous documentation. Where submission of all relevant 
documents would lead to a voluminous appeal file (for example where 
review of a disputed audit finding of inadequate documentation might 
involve thousands of receipts), the Board will consult with the parties 
about how to reduce the size of the file.


<R05>
Sec. 16.9  How the Board will promote development of the record.

    The Board may, at the time it acknowledges an appeal or at any 
appropriate later point, request additional documents or information; 
request briefing on issues in the case; issue orders to show cause why a 
proposed finding or decision of the Board should not become final; hold 
preliminary conferences (generally by telephone) to establish schedules 
and refine issues; and take such other steps as the Board determines 
appropriate to develop a prompt, sound decision.


<R05>
Sec. 16.10  Using a conference.

    (a) Once the Board has reviewed the appeal file, the Board may, on 
its own or in response to a party's request, schedule an informal 
conference. The conference will be conducted by the presiding Board 
member. The purposes of the conference are to give the parties an 
opportunity to make an oral presentation and the Board an opportunity to 
clarify issues and question both parties about matters which the Board 
may not yet fully understand from the record.
    (b) If the Board has decided to hold a conference, the Board will 
consult or correspond with the parties to schedule the conference, 
identify issues, and discuss procedures. The Board will identify the 
persons who will be allowed to participate, along with the parties' 
representatives, in the conference. The parties can submit with their 
briefs under Sec. 16.8 a list of persons who might participate with 
them, indicating how

[[Page 75]]

each person is involved in the matter. If the parties wish, they may 
also suggest questions or areas of inquiry which the Board may wish to 
pursue with each participant.
    (c) Unless the parties and the Board otherwise agree, the following 
procedures apply:
    (1) Conferences will be recorded at Department expense. On request, 
a party will be sent one copy of the transcript. The presiding Board 
member will insure an orderly transcript by controlling the sequence and 
identification of speakers.
    (2) Only in exceptional circumstances will documents be received at 
a conference. Inquiry will focus on material in the appeal file. If a 
party finds that further documents should be in the record for the 
conference, the party should supplement the appeal file, submitting a 
supplementary index and copies of the documents to the Board and the 
other party not less than ten days prior to the conference.
    (3) Each party's representative may make an oral presentation. 
Generally, the only oral communications of other participants will 
consist of statements requested by the Board or responses to the Board's 
questions. The Board will allow reply comment, and may allow short 
closing statements. On request, the Board may allow the participants to 
question each other.
    (4) There will be no post-conference submissions, unless the Board 
determines they would be helpful to resolve the case. The Board may 
require or allow the parties to submit proposed findings and 
conclusions.


<R05>
Sec. 16.11  Hearing.

    (a) Electing a hearing. If the appellant believes a hearing is 
appropriate, the appellant should specifically request one at the 
earliest possible time (in the notice of appeal or with the appeal 
file). The Board will approve a request (and may schedule a hearing on 
its own or in response to a later request) if it finds there are complex 
issues or material facts in dispute the resolution of which would be 
significantly aided by a hearing, or if the Board determines that its 
decisionmaking otherwise would be enhanced by oral presentations and 
arguments in an adversary, evidentiary hearing. The Board will also 
provide a hearing if otherwise required by law or regulation.
    (b) Preliminary conference before the hearing. The Board generally 
will hold a prehearing conference (which may be conducted by telephone 
conference call) to consider any of the following: the possibility of 
settlement; simplifying and clarifying issues; stipulations and 
admissions; limitations on evidence and witnesses that will be presented 
at the hearing; scheduling the hearing; and any other matter that may 
aid in resolving the appeal. Normally, this conference will be conducted 
informally and off the record; however, the Board, after consulting with 
the parties, may reduce results of the conference to writing in a 
document which will be made part of the record, or may transcribe 
proceedings and make the transcript part of the record.
    (c) Where hearings are held. Hearings generally are held in 
Washington, DC. In exceptional circumstances, the Board may hold the 
hearing at an HHS Regional Office or other convenient facility near the 
appellant.
    (d) Conduct of the hearing. (1) The presiding Board member will 
conduct the hearing. Hearings will be as informal as reasonably 
possible, keeping in mind the need to establish an orderly record. The 
presiding Board member generally will admit evidence unless it is 
determined to be clearly irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious, 
so the parties should avoid frequent objections to questions and 
documents. Both sides may make opening and closing statements, may 
present witnesses as agreed upon in the prehearing conference, and may 
cross-examine. Since the parties have ample opportunity to develop a 
complete appeal file, a party may introduce an exhibit at the hearing 
only after explaining to the satisfaction of the presiding Board member 
why the exhibit was not submitted earlier (for example, because the 
information was not available).
    (2) The Board may request the parties to submit written statements 
of witnesses to the Board and each other prior to the hearing so that 
the hearing will primarily be concerned with cross-examination and 
rebuttal.

[[Page 76]]

    (3) False statements of a witness may be the basis for criminal 
prosecution under sections 287 and 1001 of Title 18 of the United States 
Code.
    (4) The hearing will be recorded at Department expense.
    (e) Procedures after the hearing. The Board will send one copy of 
the transcript to each party as soon as it is received by the Board. At 
the discretion of the Board, the parties may be required or allowed to 
submit post-hearing briefs or proposed findings and conclusions (the 
parties will be informed at the hearing). A party should note any major 
prejudicial transcript errors in an addendum to its post-hearing brief 
(or if no brief will be submitted, in a letter submitted within a time 
limit set by the Board).


<R05>
Sec. 16.12  The expedited process.

    (a) Applicability. Where the amount in dispute is $25,000 or less, 
the Board will use these expedited procedures, unless the Board Chair 
determines otherwise under paragraph (b) of this section. If the Board 
and the parties agree, the Board may use these procedures in cases of 
more than $25,000.
    (b) Exceptions. If there are unique or unusually complex issues 
involved, or other exceptional circumstances, the Board may use 
additional procedures.
    (c) Regular expedited procedures. (1) Within 30 days after receiving 
the Board's acknowledgment of the appeal (see Sec. 16.7), each party 
shall submit to the Board and the other party any relevant background 
documents (organized as required under Sec. 16.8), with a cover letter 
(generally not to exceed ten pages) containing any arguments the party 
wishes to make.
    (2) Promptly after receiving the parties' submissions, the presiding 
Board member will arrange a telephone conference call to receive the 
parties' oral comments in response to each other's submissions. After 
notice to the parties, the Board will record the call. The Board member 
will advise the parties whether any opportunities for further briefing, 
submissions or oral presentations will be established. Cooperative 
efforts will be encouraged (see Sec. 16.8(d)).
    (3) The Board may require the parties to submit proposed findings 
and conclusions.
    (d) Special expedited procedures where there has already been 
review. Some HHS components (for example, the Public Health Service) use 
a board or other relatively independent reviewing authority to conduct a 
formal preliminary review process which results in a written decision 
based on a record including documents or statements presented after 
reasonable notice and opportunity to present such material. In such 
cases, the following rules apply to appeals of $25,000 or less instead 
of those under paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) Generally, the Board's review will be restricted to whether the 
decision of the preliminary review authority was clearly erroneous. But 
if the Board determines that the record is inadequate, or that the 
procedures under which the record was developed in a given instance were 
unfair, the Board will not be restricted this way.
    (2) Within 30 days after receiving the Board's acknowledgment of 
appeal (see Sec. 16.7), the parties shall submit the following:
    (i) The appellant shall submit to the Board and the respondent a 
statement why the decision was clearly erroneous. Unless allowed by the 
Board after consultation with the respondent, the appellant shall not 
submit further documents.
    (ii) The respondent shall submit to the Board the record in the 
case. If the respondent has reason to believe that all materials in the 
record already are in the possession of the appellant, the respondent 
need only send the appellant a list of the materials submitted to the 
Board.
    (iii) The respondent may, if it wishes, submit a statement why the 
decision was not clearly erroneous.
    (3) The Board, in its discretion, may allow or require the parties 
to present further arguments or information.


<R05>
Sec. 16.13  Powers and responsibilities.

    In addition to powers specified elsewhere in these procedures, Board 
members have the power to issue orders (including ``show cause'' 
orders); to examine witnesses; to take all steps necessary for the 
conduct of an orderly hearing; to rule on requests and motions, 
including motions to dismiss; to

[[Page 77]]

grant extensions of time for good reasons; to dismiss for failure to 
meet deadlines and other requirements; to close or suspend cases which 
are not ready for review; to order or assist the parties to submit 
relevant information; to remand a case for further action by the 
respondent; to waive or modify these procedures in a specific case with 
notice to the parties; to reconsider a Board decision where a party 
promptly alleges a clear error of fact or law; and to take any other 
action necessary to resolve disputes in accordance with the objectives 
of these procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 16.14  How Board review is limited.

    The Board shall be bound by all applicable laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 16.15  Failure to meet deadlines and other requirements.

    (a) Since one of the objectives of administrative dispute resolution 
is to provide a decision as fast as possible consistent with fairness, 
the Board will not allow parties to delay the process unduly. The Board 
may grant extensions of time, but only if the party gives a good reason 
for the delay.
    (b) If the appellant fails to meet any filing or procedural 
deadlines, appeal file or brief submission requirements, or other 
requirements established by the Board, the Board may dismiss the appeal, 
may issue an order requiring the party to show cause why the appeal 
should not be dismissed, or may take other action the Board considers 
appropriate.
    (c) If the respondent fails to meet any such requirements, the Board 
may issue a decision based on the record submitted to that point or take 
such other measures as the Board considers appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 16.16  Parties to the appeal.

    (a) The only parties to the appeal are the appellant and the 
respondent. If the Board determines that a third person is a real party 
in interest (for example, where the major impact of an audit 
disallowance would be on the grantee's contractor, not on the grantee), 
the Board may allow the third person to present the case on appeal for 
the appellant or to appear with a party in the case, after consultation 
with the parties and if the appellant does not object.
    (b) The Board may also allow other participation, in the manner and 
by the deadlines established by the Board, where the Board decides that 
the intervenor has a clearly identifiable and substantial interest in 
the outcome of the dispute, that participation would sharpen issues or 
otherwise be helpful in resolution of the dispute, and that 
participation would not result in substantial delay.


<R05>
Sec. 16.17  Ex parte communications (communications outside the record).

    (a) A party shall not communicate with a Board or staff member about 
matters involved in an appeal without notice to the other party. If such 
communication occurs, the Board will disclose it to the other party and 
make it part of the record after the other party has an opportunity to 
comment. Board members and staff shall not consider any information 
outside the record (see Sec. 16.21 for what the record consists of) 
about matters involved in an appeal.
    (b) The above does not apply to the following: Communications among 
Board members and staff; communications concerning the Board's 
administrative functions or procedures; requests from the Board to a 
party for a document (although the material submitted in response also 
must be given to the other party); and material which the Board includes 
in the record after notice and an opportunity to comment.


<R05>
Sec. 16.18  Mediation.

    (a) In cases pending before the Board. If the Board decides that 
mediation would be useful to resolve a dispute, the Board, in 
consultation with the parties, may suggest use of mediation techniques 
and will provide or assist in selecting a mediator. The mediator may 
take any steps agreed upon by the parties to resolve the dispute or 
clarify issues. The results of mediation are not binding on the parties 
unless the parties so agree in writing. The Board will internally 
insulate the mediator from any Board or staff members assigned to handle 
the appeal.
    (b) In other cases. In any other grants dispute, the Board may, 
within the

[[Page 78]]

limitations of its resources, offer persons trained in mediation skills 
to aid in resolving the dispute. Mediation services will only be offered 
at the request, or with the concurrence, of a responsible federal 
program official in the program under which the dispute arises. The 
Board will insulate the mediator if any appeal subsequently arises from 
the dispute.


<R05>
Sec. 16.19  How to calculate deadlines.

    In counting days, include Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays; but if a 
due date would fall on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday, then the 
due date is the next Federal working day.


<R05>
Sec. 16.20  How to submit material to the Board.

    (a) All submissions should be addressed as follows: Departmental 
Grant Appeals Board, Room 2004, Switzer Building, 330 C Street SW., 
Washington, DC 20201.
    (b) All submissions after the notice of appeal should identify the 
Board's docket number (the Board's acknowledgement under Sec. 16.7 will 
specify the docket number).
    (c) Unless the Board otherwise specifies, parties shall submit to 
the Board an original and two copies of all materials. Each submission 
other than the notice of appeal, must include a statement that one copy 
of the materials has been sent to the other party, identifying when and 
to whom the copy was sent.
    (d) Unless hand delivered, all materials should be sent to the Board 
and the other party by certified or registered mail, return receipt 
requested.
    (e) The Board considers material to be submitted on the date when it 
is postmarked or hand delivered to the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 16.21  Record and decisions.

    (a) Each decision is issued by three Board members (see Sec. 
16.5(b)), who base their decision on a record consisting of the appeal 
file; other submissions of the parties; transcripts or other records of 
any meetings, conferences or hearings conducted by the Board; written 
statements resulting from conferences; evidence submitted at hearings; 
and orders and other documents issued by the Board. In addition, the 
Board may include other materials (such as evidence submitted in another 
appeal) after the parties are given notice and an opportunity to 
comment.
    (b) The Board will promptly notify the parties in writing of any 
disposition of a case and the basis for the disposition.


<R05>
Sec. 16.22  The effect of an appeal.

    (a) General. Until the Board disposes of an appeal, the respondent 
shall take no action to implement the final decision appealed.
    (b) Exceptions. The respondent may--
    (1) Suspend funding (see Sec. 74.114 of this title);
    (2) Defer or disallow other claims questioned for reasons also 
disputed in the pending appeal;
    (3) In programs listed in Appendix A, B.(a)(1), implement a decision 
to disallow Federal financial participation claimed in expenditures 
reported on a statement of expenditures, by recovering, withholding or 
offsetting payments, if the decision is issued before the reported 
expenditures are included in the calculation of a subsequent grant; or
    (4) Take other action to recover, withhold, or offset funds if 
specifically authorized by statute or regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 16.23  How long an appeal takes.

    The Board has established general goals for its consideration of 
cases, as follows (measured from the point when the Board receives the 
first submission after the notice of appeal):

--For regular review based on a written record under Sec. 16.8, 6 
months. When a conference under Sec. 16.10 is held, the goal remains at 
6 months, unless a requirement for post-conference briefing in a 
particular case renders the goal unrealistic.
--For cases involving a hearing under Sec. 16.11, 9 months.
--For the expedited process under Sec. 16.12, 3 months.

    These are goals, not rigid requirements. The paramount concern of 
the Board is to take the time needed to review a record fairly and 
adequately in order to produce a sound decision. Furthermore, many 
factors are beyond the

[[Page 79]]

Board's direct control, such as unforeseen delays due to the parties' 
negotiations or requests for extensions, how many cases are filed, and 
Board resources. On the other hand, the parties may agree to steps which 
may shorten review by the Board; for example, by waiving the right to 
submit a brief, by agreeing to shorten submission schedules, or by 
electing the expedited process.

         Appendix A to Part 16--What Disputes the Board Reviews

A. What this Appendix covers.
    This appendix describes programs which use the Board for dispute 
resolution, the types of disputes covered, and any conditions for Board 
review of final written decisions resulting from those disputes. 
Disputes under programs not specified in this appendix may be covered in 
a program regulation or in a memorandum of understanding between the 
Board and the head of the appropriate HHS operating component or other 
agency responsible for administering the program. If in doubt, call the 
Board. Even though a dispute may be covered here, the Board still may 
not be able to review it if the limits in paragraph F apply.

B. Mandatory grant programs.
    (a) The Board reviews the following types of final written decisions 
in disputes arising in HHS programs authorizing the award of mandatory 
grants:
    (1) Disallowances under Titles I, IV, VI, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), XIX, 
and XX of the Social Security Act, including penalty disallowances such 
as those under sections 403(g) and 1903(g) of the Act and fiscal 
disallowances based on quality control samples.
    (2) Disallowances in mandatory grant programs administered by the 
Public Health Service, including Title V of the Social Security Act.
    (3) Disallowances in the programs under sections 113 and 132 of the 
Developmental Disabilities Act.
    (4) Disallowances under Title III of the Older American Act.
    (5) Decisions relating to repayment and withholding under block 
grant programs as provided in 45 CFR 96.52.
    (6) Decisions relating to repayment and withholding under State 
Legalization Impact Assistance Grants as provided in 45 CFR 402.24 and 
402.25.
    (b) In some of these disputes, there is an option for review by the 
head of the granting agency prior to appeal to the Board. Where an 
appellant has requested review by the agency head first, the ``final 
written decision'' required by Sec. 16.3 for purposes of Board review 
will generally be the agency head's decision affirming the disallowance. 
If the agency head declines to review the disallowance or if the 
appellant withdraws its request for review by the agency head, the 
original disallowance decision is the ``final written decision.'' In the 
latter cases, the 30-day period for submitting a notice of appeal begins 
with the date of receipt of the notice declining review or with the date 
of the withdrawal letter.

C. Direct, discretionary project programs.
    (a) The Board reviews the following types of final written decisions 
in disputes arising in any HHS program authorizing the award of direct, 
discretionary project grants or cooperative agreements:
    (1) A disallowance or other determination denying payment of an 
amount claimed under an award, or requiring return or set-off of funds 
already received. This does not apply to determinations of award amount 
or disposition of unobligated balances, or selection in the award 
document of an option for disposition of program-related income.
    (2) A termination for failure to comply with the terms of an award.
    (3) A denial of a noncompeting continuation award under the project 
period system of funding where the denial is for failure to comply with 
the terms of a previous award.
    (4) A voiding (a decision that an award is invalid because it was 
not authorized by statute or regulation or because it was fraudulently 
obtained).
    (b) Where an HHS component uses a preliminary appeal process (for 
example, the Public Health Service), the ``final written decision'' for 
purposes of Board review is the decision issued as a result of that 
process.

D. Cost allocation and rate disputes.
    The Board reviews final written decisions in disputes which may 
affect a number of HHS programs because they involve cost allocation 
plans or rate determinations. These include decisions related to cost 
allocation plans negotiated with State or local governments and 
negotiated rates such as indirect cost rates, fringe benefit rates, 
computer rates, research patient care rates, and other special rates.

E. SSI agreement disputes.
    The Board reviews disputes in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 
program arising under agreements for Federal administration of State 
supplementary payments under section 1616 of the Social Security Act or 
mandatory minimum supplements under section 212 of Pub. L. 93-66. In 
these cases, the Board provides an opportunity to be heard and offer 
evidence at the Secretarial level of review as set out in the applicable 
agreements. Thus, the ``final written decision'' for purposes of Board 
review is that determination appealable to the Secretary under the 
agreement.

F. Where Board review is not available.

[[Page 80]]

    The Board will not review a decision if a hearing under 5 U.S.C. 554 
is required by statute, if the basis of the decision is a violation of 
applicable civil rights or nondiscrimination laws or regulations (for 
example, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act), or if some other hearing 
process is established pursuant to statute.

G. How the Board determines whether it will review a case.
    Under Sec. 16.7, the Board Chair determines whether an appeal meets 
the requirements of this Appendix. If the Chair finds that there is some 
question about this, the Board will request the written opinion of the 
HHS component which issued the decision. Unless the Chair determines 
that the opinion is clearly erroneous, the Board will be bound by the 
opinion. If the HHS component does not respond within a time set by the 
Chair, or cannot determine whether the Board clearly does or does not 
have jurisdiction, the Board will take the appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 17.1  Definition.

    Adverse information released by an agency means any statement or 
release by the Department or any principal operating component made to 
the news media inviting public attention to an action or a finding by 
the Department or principal operating component of the Department which 
may adversely affect persons or organizations identified therein. This 
part does not apply to nor is it affected by any disclosure of records 
to the public in response to requests made under the Freedom of 
Information Act (Pub. L. 90-23). The criteria for such disclosures are 
set forth in the Department's Public Information Regulation (45 CFR Part 
5).


<R05>
Sec. 17.2  Basic policy.

    All adverse information release to news media shall be factual in 
content and accurate in description. Disparaging terminology not 
essential to the content and purpose of the publicity shall be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 17.3  Precautions to be taken.

    The issuing organization shall take reasonable precautions to assure 
that information released is accurate and that its release fulfills an 
authorized purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 17.4  Regulatory investigations and trial-type proceedings.

    Adverse information relating to regulatory investigations of 
specifically identified persons or organizations or to pending agency 
trial-type proceedings shall be released only in limited circumstances 
in accordance with the criteria outlined below:
    (a) Where the Department or a principal operating component 
determines that there is a significant risk that the public health or 
safety may be impaired or substantial economic harm may occur unless the 
public is notified immediately, it may release information to news media 
as one of the means of notifying the affected public speedily and 
accurately. However, where the Department or principal operating 
component determines that public harm can be avoided by immediate 
discontinuance of an offending practice, a respondent shall be allowed 
an opportunity, where feasible, to cease the practice (pending a legal 
test) in lieu of release of adverse information by the agency.
    (b) Where it is required in order to bring notice of pending agency 
adjudication to persons likely to desire to participate therein or 
likely to be affected by that or a related adjudication, the Department 
or principal operating component shall rely on the news media to the 
extent necessary to provide such notice even though it may be adverse to 
a respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 17.5  Context to be reflected.

    The authority for and the character of the information shall be made 
clear,

[[Page 81]]

where appropriate, the release shall explain the nature of any studies 
performed, the sources of relevant data, the areas in which 
administrative findings of fact were made, and whether the information 
is based on allegations subject to subsequent adjudication.


<R05>
Sec. 17.6  Advance notice.

    Any respondent or prospective respondent in an agency proceeding 
shall, if practicable and consistent with the nature of the proceeding, 
be given advance notice of information to be released about the 
proceeding and a reasonable opportunity to prepare in advance a response 
to the information released.


<R05>
Sec. 17.7  Retractions or corrections.

    Where the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs finds that 
information released by the Department was misleading or a misstatement 
of fact and any person named therein requests a retraction or 
correction, the Department shall issue a retraction or correction in the 
same manner to all of the media outlets that received the original 
information (or as many of them as is feasible). Where information shown 
to be misleading or misstatement of fact has been released by a 
principal operating component of the Department and any person named 
therein requests a retraction or correction, the agency head shall issue 
a retraction or correction in the same manner to all of the media 
outlets that received the original information (or as many of them as is 
feasible).

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 30.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This regulation prescribes standards and procedures for the 
officers and employees of the Department, including officers and 
employees of the various Operating Divisions and regional offices of the 
Department, charged with collection and disposition of debts owed to the 
United States.
    (b) These standards and procedures will be applied where a statute, 
regulation or contract does not prescribe different standards or 
procedures. The authority for the regulation lies in the Federal Claims 
Collection Act of 1966,

[[Page 82]]

as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3711 and 3716-3718; the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards, at 4 CFR Parts 101-105; related statutes (5 U.S.C. 5512 and 
5514, 5 U.S.C. 552a) and regulations (5 CFR Part 550); and the common 
law. The covered activities include collecting claims in any amount; 
compromising claims, or suspending or terminating collection of claims 
that do not exceed $20,000, exclusive of interest and charges; and 
referring debts that cannot be disposed of by the Department to the 
Department of Justice or to the General Accounting Office for further 
administrative action or litigation. Further guidance may be found in 
the Departmental General Administration Manual, Personnel Manual, 
Accounting Manual and Grants Administration Manual, and any other 
manuals which may be issued by each Operating Division, office, or 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 30.2  Definitions.

    In this part, unless the context otherwise requires--
    Amounts payable under the Social Security Act means payments by the 
Department to beneficiaries, providers, intermediaries, physicians, 
suppliers, carriers, States, or other contractors or grantees under a 
Social Security Act program, including: Title I (Grants to States for 
Old-Age Assistance and Medical Assistance for the Aged); Title II 
(Federal Old-Age Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits); Title 
III (Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration); 
Title IV (Grants to States for Aid and Services to Needy Families with 
Children and for Child-Welfare Services); Title V (Maternal and Child 
Health and Crippled Children's Services); Title IX (Unemployment 
Compensation Program); Title X (Grants to States for Aid to the Blind); 
Title XI, Part B (Peer Review of the Utilization and Quality of Health 
Care Services); Title XII (Advances to State Unemployment Funds); Title 
XIV (Grants to States for Aid to Permanently and Totally Disabled); 
Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and 
Disabled); Title XVII (Grants to States to Fight Mental Retardation); 
Title XVIII (Medicare); Title XIX (Medicaid); and Title XX (Block Grants 
to States for Social Services). Federal employee salaries and other 
payments made by the Department in the course of administering the 
provisions of the Social Security Act are not deemed to be ``payable 
under'' the Social Security Act for purposes of this regulation.
    Claim or Debt means an amount of money or other property owed to the 
United States. Debts include, but are not limited to amounts owed on 
account of loans made, insured or guaranteed by the United States; 
salary overpayments to employees; overpayments to program beneficiaries; 
overpayments to contractors and grantees, including overpayments arising 
from audit disallowances; excessive cash advances to employees, grantees 
and contractors; civil penalties and assessments; theft or loss of money 
or property; and damages.
    Debtor means an individual, organization, association, partnership, 
corporation, or a State or local government or subdivision indebted to 
the Department; or the person or entity with legal responsibility for 
assuming the debtor's obligation.
    Debts arising under the Social Security Act are overpayments to, or 
contributions, penalties or assessments owed by, beneficiaries, 
providers, intermediaries, physicians, suppliers, carriers, States or 
other contractors or grantees under Titles I, II, III, IV, V, IX, X, XI 
(Part B), XII, XIV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX of the Social Security 
Act. Salary overpayments and other debts that result from the 
administration of the provisions of the Social Security Act are not 
deemed to ``arise under'' the Social Security Act for purposes of this 
regulation.
    Department means the United States Department of Health and Human 
Services and each of its Operating Divisions and regional offices.
    Liquidated or certain in amount refers to a debt of an amount 
already fixed and determined by the Secretary, or which may be readily 
fixed and determined from the information available in the debt file, 
irrespective of any dispute by the debtor.
    Local government means a political subdivision, instrumentality, or 
authority of any State; the District of

[[Page 83]]

Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; a territory or possession of 
the United States; or an Indian tribe, band or nation.
    Operating Division means each separate component within the 
Department of Health and Human Services, and includes the Office of the 
Secretary, the Office of Human Development Services, the Family Support 
Administration, theCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Public 
Health Service and the Social Security Administration.
    Overdue refers to a debt not paid by the payment due date specified 
in the notice of the debt to the debtor (see Sec. 30.13(a)) and not the 
subject of a repayment agreement approved by the Secretary. Also, a debt 
subject to repayment agreement is considered overdue if the debtor fails 
to satisfy his or her obligations under that agreement. ``Overdue'' and 
``delinquent'' have the same meaning. See 4 CFR 101.2(b).
    Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the 
Secretary's designee within any Operating Division or Regional Office.


<R05>
Sec. 30.3  Interagency claims.

    This regulation does not apply to debts owed by other Federal 
agencies. These debts will be resolved by negotiation or referral to the 
General Accounting Office.


<R05>
Sec. 30.4  Other administrative proceedings.

    This regulation does not supersede or require omission or 
duplication of administrative proceedings required under contract, 
statute, regulation or other agency procedures. Examples: Resolution of 
audit findings under grants or contracts, Chapter 1-105, Grants 
Administration Manual (GAM); informal grant appeals, 45 CFR Part 75 
(Departmental), 42 CFR 50.401 et seq. (Public Health Service); formal 
appeals to the Departmental Grant Appeals Board, 45 CFR Part 16; and 
review under a procurement contract Disputes Clause and the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), 48 CFR Part 33.


<R05>
Sec. 30.5  Other remedies.

    The remedies and sanctions available to the Department under this 
regulation when collecting debts are not intended to be exclusive. The 
Secretary may impose other appropriate sanctions upon a debtor for 
inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure to pay a debt. For example, 
the Secretary may stop doing business with a grantee, contractor, 
borrower or lender; convert the method of payment under a grant from an 
advance to a reimbursement method; or revoke a grantee's letter-of-
credit.


<R05>
Sec. 30.6  Property claims.

    Any person who converts, or negligently loses or destroys personal 
property belonging, entrusted or loaned to the Department is liable for 
the return of the property or payment of its fair market value. A person 
who damages such property is liable for the cost of repairs or its fair 
market value, whichever is less. Collection of these debts means the 
recovery of the property, its fair market value, or the cost of repairs. 
Demand for payment of these claims means a demand for the return of the 
property or for payment of its fair market value or the cost of repairs.


<R05>
Sec. 30.7  Claims involving criminal activity or misconduct.

    (a) A debtor whose indebtedness involves criminal activity is 
subject to punishment by fine or imprisonment as well as to a civil 
claim by the United States for compensation for the misappropriated 
funds or property. Examples of such activity are fraud, embezzlement and 
theft or misuse of Government money or property. See 18 U.S.C. 641, 643. 
The Secretary will refer cases of suspected criminal activity or 
misconduct to the Office of Inspector General. That office will 
investigate such cases, refer them to the Department of Justice for 
criminal prosecution and/or return them to the Secretary for collection, 
application of administrative sanctions or other disposition.
    (b) Debts involving anti-trust violations, fraud, false claims or 
misrepresentation--
    (1) Shall be referred by the Secretary to the Office of Inspector 
General for review. The Office of Inspector General

[[Page 84]]

shall refer the claim back to the Secretary for collection or other 
disposition to the extent authorized by the Department of Justice.
    (2) Shall not be compromised, terminated, suspended or otherwise 
disposed of by the Secretary under these regulations. Only the 
Department of Justice is authorized to compromise, terminate, suspend or 
otherwise dispose of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 30.8  Claims arising from GAO exceptions.

    The Secretary may not compromise but will collect, suspend or 
terminate collection of debts due on account of illegal, improper or 
incorrect payments shown in General Accounting Office notices of 
exception issued to certifying or disbursing officers. Only the General 
Accounting Office has the authority to compromise such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 30.9  Subdivision of claims.

    Debts may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceilings imposed 
by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a) (2) and (3) on the Secretary's authority to 
compromise, suspend or terminate collection of debts. A debtor's 
liability arising from a particular incident or transaction will be 
considered a single debt in determining whether the claim exceeds 
$20,000 for purposes of compromising, suspending or terminating 
collection efforts.


<R05>
Sec. 30.10  Omissions not a defense.

    Failure by the Secretary to comply with any provision of this 
regulation may not serve as a defense to any debtor.


<R04>
                     Subpart B--Collection of Claims


<R05>
Sec. 30.11  Collection rule.

    (a) Aggressive agency action. The Secretary will take aggressive 
action to collect debts and reduce delinquencies. Collection efforts 
shall, at a minimum, normally include sending to the debtor's last known 
address a total of three progressively stronger written demands for 
payment at not more than 30-day intervals unless amounts are available 
for offset under section 30.15, or a response to the first or second 
demand indicates that further demand would be futile and the debtor's 
response does not require rebuttal.
    (b) Immediate action. When necessary to protect the Government's 
interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate action, 
such as withholding of amounts payable to the debtor or immediate 
referral of the debt for litigation or filing of a claim in bankruptcy 
court or against a decedent's estate.
    (c) Finding debtors. The Secretary will exhaust every reasonable 
effort to locate debtors, using such sources as telephone directories, 
city directories, postmasters, driving license records, automobile title 
and license records in State and local government agencies, the Internal 
Revenue Service, credit reporting agencies and skip locator services. 
Referral of a confess-judgment note to the appropriate United States 
Attorney's Office for entry of judgment will not be delayed because the 
debtor cannot be located.
    (d) Joint and several liability. Collection of the full amount of 
the debt will be pursued from each debtor jointly and severally liable.
    (e) Debtor disputes. A debtor who disputes a debt must promptly 
provide available supporting evidence.
    (f) Debt files. The Secretary will maintain an administrative file 
for each debt or debtor, documenting the debt(s), all administrative 
collection action, including communications to and from the debtor, and 
disposition of the debt(s). Information from a debt file relating to an 
individual may be disclosed only for purposes consistent with this 
regulation, the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), and any other 
applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 30.12  Notices to debtor.

    (a) Required notice. The first written demand for payment must 
inform the debtor of--
    (1) The amount and nature of the debt;
    (2) The date payment is due, which will generally be 30 days from 
the date the notice was mailed; and
    (3) The assessment under Sec. 30.13 of interest from the date the 
notice was mailed, and full administrative costs if payment is not 
received within the 30 days.

[[Page 85]]

    (b) Other notice. Where applicable, the Secretary must inform the 
debtor in writing of--(1) His or her right to dispute the debt or 
request a waiver of the debt, citing the applicable review or waiver 
authority, the conditions for review or waiver, and the effect of the 
review or waiver request on collection of the debt, interest, charges 
and late payment penalties (see Sec. 30.14);
    (2) The office, address and telephone number that the debtor should 
contact to discuss repayment, reconsideration or waiver of the debt;
    (3) The proposed sanctions if the debt is overdue, including 
assessment of late payment penalties under 30.13 (if the debt is more 
than 90 days overdue) or referral of the debt to a credit reporting 
agency under Sec. 30.17, or to a collection agency under Sec. 30.18. 
(See also Sec. 30.5).
    (c) Exception. This section does not require duplication of any 
notice already contained in a written agreement, letter or other 
document signed by, or provided to the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 30.13  Interest, administrative costs and late payment penalties.

    (a) Interest. (1) Interest will accrue on all debts from the date 
notice of the debt and the interest requirement is first mailed to the 
last known address or hand-delivered to the debtor if the debt is not 
paid within 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice. Except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or unless the Secretary 
determines a higher rate is necessary to protect the Government's 
interests, the Secretary shall charge an annual rate of interest as 
fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into consideration 
private consumer rates of interest prevailing on the date that the 
Department becomes entitled to recovery. This rate may be revised 
quarterly by the Secretary of the Treasury and shall be published by the 
HHS Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget quarterly in the 
Federal Register. Debtors who were not paying interest, or were paying 
interest at a different rate prior to October 25, 1982, may be charged 
interest at the above-stated rate in effect on the date that notice of 
the new interest requirement is mailed after 1982. The Secretary may use 
the advance billing procedure and include the interest notification 
prior to the debt being owed. Bills sent before a debt is due will 
include notification of the interest requirement. In these cases, 
interest will begin to accrue on the day after the due date.
    (2) The interest rate established in paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be no lower than the current value of funds rate, as set by the 
Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, except that in the 
case of installment payment agreements under Sec. 30.19, such rate shall 
be no lower than the applicable rate determined from the U.S. Treasury 
``Schedule of Certified Interest Rates with Range of Maturities.''
    (3) The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, extend the 30 day 
interest-free period an additional 30 days if the Secretary determines 
that such action is in the best interests of the Government, or 
otherwise warranted by equity and good conscience.
    (4) The rate of interest, as initially assessed, will remain fixed 
for the duration of the indebtedness; except that if a debtor defaults 
on a repayment agreement, interest may be set at the Treasury rate in 
effect on the date a new agreement is executed.
    (5) Interest will not be charged on interest, administrative costs 
or late payment penalties required by this section. However, if the 
debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, unpaid accrued 
interest, charges and late payment penalties under the defaulted 
agreement may be added to the principal to be paid under a new repayment 
agreement.
    (b) Administrative costs of collecting overdue debts. Delinquent 
debtors will be assessed the administrative costs incurred by the 
Department as a result of handling and collecting the overdue debts, 
based on either actual or average costs incurred. These costs will 
include direct (personnel, supplies, etc.) and indirect costs of 
collecting inhouse and contracting with collection agencies and may 
include the costs of providing hearings or any other form of review 
requested by debtors. See Sec. 30.14. These charges will be assessed 
monthly, or per payment period, throughout the period that the debt is 
overdue. Such costs may also be additive to

[[Page 86]]

other administrative costs if collection is being made for another 
Federal agency or unit.
    (c) Late payment penalties. A penalty charge of 6 percent a year 
will be assessed on a debt, a payment, or any portion thereof that is 
more than 90 days overdue. Late payment penalty charges will accrue from 
the date the debt, or portion thereof, became overdue until the overdue 
amount is paid. These charges will be assessed monthly, or per payment 
period. See also Sec. 30.14.
    (d) Social Security Act debts. (1) Unless specifically authorized by 
statute, regulations or written agreement, or unless the debts arise 
from, or involve, fraud or criminal activity, the Secretary will not 
charge interest on debts arising from payments to beneficiaries under 
Titles II, XVI and XVIII of Social Security Act. The charging of 
interest is appropriate on debts arising from section 1862(b) of the Act 
for Medicare payments for which a beneficiary has been reimbursed by a 
liable third party, in which case the charging of interest would be 
appropriate.
    (2) The Secretary will charge administrative costs or late payment 
penalties on debts arising under the Social Security Act where 
authorized by statute, regulations, or written agreement.
    (e) Other debts not covered by 31 U.S.C. 3717. The Secretary will 
charge administrative costs or late payment penalties on debts arising 
under a contract executed prior to, and in effect on October 25, 1982, 
or debts owed by State or local governments where authorized by statute, 
regulation, or written agreement.
    (f) Allocation of payments. Partial or installment payments will be 
applied first to outstanding administrative cost charges and late 
payment penalties, second to accrued interest and third to outstanding 
principal.
    (g) Inactive claims. Interest, but not administrative cost charges 
or late payment penalties, will continue to accrue when collection of a 
debt is suspended under Sec. 30.33(a).
    (h) Waivers. The Secretary may waive collecting all or part of 
interest, administrative costs or late payment penalties, if--
    (1) The debt or the charges resulted from the agency's error, action 
or inaction (other than normal processing delays), and without fault on 
the part of the debtors; or
    (2) Collection in any manner authorized under this regulation would 
defeat the overall objectives of a Departmental program.


<R05>
Sec. 30.14  Interest and charges pending waiver or review.

    (a) Rule. A debtor may either pay the debt, or be liable for 
interest on the uncollected debt, while a waiver determination, a bona 
fide dispute or a formal or informal review of the debt is pending. If a 
final determination is to the effect that any amount was properly a debt 
to HHS and the debtor chose to retain the amount in dispute, the 
Secretary shall collect or offset from any future payments to the 
debtor, an amount equal to the amount of the debt plus interest (as 
calculated under Sec. 30.13(a)) on such debt amount starting from the 
date the debtor was first made aware of the debt and ending when such 
debt is repaid. The debtor will also be assessed administrative cost 
charges and late payment penalties on the upaid debt for this period if 
the reviewing or hearing officer determines in writing that the request 
for a waiver, a hearing or other form of review was spurious.
    (b) Exception. Interest, late payment penalties and administrative 
cost charges will not be assessed pending consideration of waiver or 
review under a statute which prohibits collection of the debt during 
this period, unless the reviewing or hearing officer determines in 
writing that the request for a waiver, a hearing or other form of review 
was spurious.


<R05>
Sec. 30.15  Administrative offset.

    (a) Rule. The Secretary will collect debts owed to the Department by 
administrative offset if--
    (1) The debt is liquidated or certain in amount;
    (2) Offset is not expressly or implicitly prohibited by statute or 
regulation;
    (3) Offset is cost-effective or has significant deterrent value;

[[Page 87]]

    (4) Offset does not substantially impair or defeat program 
objectives; and
    (5) Overall, offset is best suited to further and protect the 
Government's interest.

The Secretary may consider financial impact of the proposed offset on 
the debtor in determining the method and amount of the offset.
    (b) Definitions. (1) ``Administrative Offset'' means satisfying a 
debt by withholding money payable by the Department to, or held by the 
Department for a debtor. Amounts available for offset include, for 
example, benefit payments to a program beneficiary overpaid under the 
same or a different program, amounts due a defaulting or overpaid 
contractor or grantee under the same or a different agreement, salaries 
of Federal employees, Federal income tax refunds and judgments held by 
the debtor against the United States. (Offset against judgments will be 
effected through the Comptroller General pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3728.)
    (2) ``Hearing'' means either a review of the record or an oral 
hearing. A review of the record means a review of the documentary 
evidence by a designated hearing officer. An oral hearing means an 
informal conference before a designated hearing officer.
    (3) ``Hearing officer'' is an individual appointed by the Secretary 
to review and issue a final decision on an employee's dispute of a debt. 
In the case of an employee debt subject to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the hearing 
officer may not be an individual under the supervision of the Secretary; 
will normally be an independent contractor of the Department or an 
employee of another Federal agency, see 4 CFR 102.1 and 5 CFR 550.1107; 
and may be an administrative law judge if appointment of an independent 
contractor or an employee of another Federal agency is not feasible.
    (4) ``Pay'' means basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired 
pay, retainer pay, or, in case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, 
other authorized pay.
    (5) ``Disposable pay'' means the amount that remains from an 
employee's Federal pay after withholding of all deductions listed in 5 
CFR 581.105(b) and any other deductions required by law (including, but 
not limited to, Federal, State, and local income taxes; Social Security 
taxes, including Medicare taxes; and Federal retirement programs).
    (c) Scope. This section satisfies the standards in 4 CFR 102.3 and 
102.4 and 5 CFR Part 550, for offset under the common law, 31 U.S.C. 
3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514 and any other statute under which standards and 
procedures for offset have not otherwise been promulgated, including:
    (1) Offset of debts owed or to amounts payable, under a grant or 
contract; except that paragraphs (j)-(p) of this section do not apply. 
See Sec. 30.4.
    (2) Offset of debts owed by former employees from final salary and 
lump sum payments; and from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability 
Fund (which also requires compliance with 5 CFR Part 831, Subpart R);
    (3) Offset of salary overpayments and other debts under statutes 
such as 5 U.S.C. 5514 (or 31 U.S.C. 3716 in the case of commissioned 
officers), travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705, training expenses under 
5 U.S.C. 4108, debts of employees removed for cause under 5 U.S.C. 5511 
and amounts owed by accountable officers under 5 U.S.C. 5512, from the 
current pay of Federal employees, including employees of the Social 
Security Administration and other offices administering a Social 
Security Act program;
    (4) Offset of debts owed by state or local governments;
    (5) Offset of debts arising, or from amounts payable, under the 
Social Security Act, except that unless specifically authorized by 
statute, regulation, or written agreement, or unless the debts arise 
from, or involve, fraud or criminal activity, administrative offset will 
not be applied to recover debts arising from, or to withhold, payments 
to beneficiaries under Titles II, XVI, and XVIII of the Social Security 
Act with the exception of debts arising from section 1862(b) of the Act 
for Medicare payments for which a beneficiary has been reimbursed by a 
liable third party.
    (d) Exceptions. (1) So long as the conditions listed in paragraphs 
(a) (2)-(5) and (e) are met, offset may be effected

[[Page 88]]

with the debtor's consent without regard to the other provisions in this 
section.
    (2) This section does not apply to debts reduced to judgment, debts 
already subject to a written repayment or settlement agreement, or debts 
with respect to which the specified procedures have already been 
otherwise afforded. Debts reduced to judgment may be offset from the 
current pay of a Federal employee under Federal Personnel Manual 
Supplement 552-1.
    (3) This section does not apply to any adjustment to a Federal 
employee's pay arising out of the employee's request for, or change in, 
coverage under a Federal benefits program such as health or life 
insurance, which requires periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to 
be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. Employees 
consent to deductions from pay whenever they elect or change coverage. 
Affected employees will receive a notice informing them of these 
retroactive adjustments to pay and the office to contact if the employee 
disputes the amount of the adjustment.
    (e) Advance payments. Under many programs, the Department advances 
funds to pay for a recipient's anticipated costs. Before offsetting such 
an advance payment in order to collect a debt, the Secretary may request 
an assurance that the recipient will incur additional allowable costs 
whose Federal share is at least equal to the amount of the offset plus 
the amount of funds actually advanced. If the Secretary believes that 
the recipient will not incur sufficient costs, the advance will not be 
offset. In such case, the Secretary may request cash payment or convert 
the method of paying the recipient from an advance to a reimbursement 
basis and collect the debt by offsetting payments for costs already 
incurred.
    (f) Multiple debts. Amounts available for offset will be applied to 
multiple debts in accordance with the best interests of the Department 
and the Government as determined on a case-by-case basis. Other factors 
being equal, recovery will be equally apportioned, except that debts 
owed to the Department will be satisfied before debts owed to other 
Federal agencies.
    (g) Statutory bar to offset. (1) Administrative offset will not be 
initiated more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the 
debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to 
collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known 
by the officer responsible for discovering or collecting the debt. For 
this purpose, a debt accrues when it is administratively determined to 
exist, when it is affirmed by an administrative appeals board or a court 
having jurisdiction, or when a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement, 
whichever is later. Offset is initiated when the notice of the proposed 
offset is mailed to the debtor under paragraph (i) of this section or 
under other agency procedures, when money payable to the debtor is first 
withheld, or when the Department requests offset from money held by 
another agency, whichever is first.
    (2) The 10 year statutory bar does not apply to offset of a debt 
arising out of the Social Security Act. However, offset against such 
debts will generally not be initiated more than 10 years after the debt 
accrued unless the Secretary did not previously have the necessary 
information or the means by which to collect the debt by administrative 
offset.
    (h) Offset against assigned claims. The Assignment of Claims Act of 
1940, 31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15, strictly limits the conditions under 
which a contractor or any other person or entity entitled to receive 
payments from the United States may assign his or her rights to the 
payments to a third party. The Federal Acquisition Regulations implement 
at 48 CFR Part 32, Subpart 32.8, the statutory conditions to assignment 
of a contractor's right to be paid by the United States for performance 
under a Federal procurement contract. A contractor may assign his or her 
right to payment by the United States only to a bank, trust company, or 
other financing institution, as security for a loan to the contrator.
    (1) The Secretary normally may not collect a debt owed by a 
contractor by offset from payments due the contractor if the contractor 
has properly assigned his or her rights to such payments to a financing 
institution, the

[[Page 89]]

assigned payments are due under a contract with a ``no setoff'' 
provision, and--
    (i) The contractor's debt to the United States arose independently 
of the contract; or
    (ii) The debt arose under the contract because of renegotiation, 
fines, penalties (other than penalties for noncompliance with the terms 
of the contract), taxes or social security contributions, or withholding 
or nonwithholding of taxes or social security contributions. 
Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all the conditions of this 
paragraph, offset may be appropriate under certain circumstances, for 
example: If the financing institution has made neither a loan nor a firm 
commitment to make a loan under the assignment; or to the extent that 
the amount due on the contract exceeds the amount of any loans made or 
expected to be made under a firm commitment.
    (2) The Secretary may not offset a debt from payments due any debtor 
if the debtor has properly assigned his or her right to such payments 
and the debt arose after the effective date of the assignment.
    (3) The Secretary may not attempt to satisfy the assignor's 
indebtedness by recovering payments already made to the assignee.
    (i) Amount of offset. Whenever feasible debts will be offset in one 
lump sum, except that deductions from an employee's current pay pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 5514 may not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable 
pay for any pay period, unless the employee agrees in writing to a 
larger deduction. However, if the employee retires, resigns, or is 
discharged, or if his or her employment or active duty otherwise ends, 
an amount necessary to satisfy the debt may be offset immediately from 
payments of any nature due the individual.
    (j) Pre-offset requirements. Before effecting offset, the Secretary 
will send the debtor written notice of the following--
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) The agency intention to collect the debt by offsetting the lump 
sum or installments (stating the amount, frequency, proposed beginning 
date and duration of the installments) unless the debtor pays the debt 
or responds within 30 days from the date the notice was mailed to the 
debtor;
    (3) The interest, administrative cost charges and penalties that 
will or may be assessed under Sec.Sec. 30.13 and 30.14 if the debt is 
not paid, or the debtor has not consented to a lump sum offset, within 
30 days from the date the notice was mailed to the debtor;
    (4) The debtor's right, if a previous opportunity was not provided, 
to request within 15 days (unless otherwise provided by statute or 
regulation) from the date of mailing of the notice--
    (i) Copies of agency records pertaining to the debt;
    (ii) An alternative repayment schedule; or
    (iii) A hearing if the debtor contends no debt is owed, the debt is 
for a different amount, or the proposed offset does not comply with this 
section;
    (5) The debtor's right, if any, to request waiver of the debt, 
interest or changes, citing the applicable statutory authority, request 
procedures and waiver conditions and the effect of the waiver request on 
collection of the debt, interest and charges by offset;
    (6) The office, address and telephone number of whom the debtor 
should address any inquiries or requests;
    (7) The requirement that the hearing officer issue a decision at the 
earliest practical date; except that under 5 U.S.C. 5514, the decision 
may be issued no later than 60 days after the request for the hearing 
was filed unless the employee requested and was granted an extension;
    (8) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, 
representations or evidence may subject the debtor to criminal or civil 
penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001 and 1002 or 31 U.S.C. 3729-
3731; or also disciplinary action under 5 CFR Part 752 or any other 
applicable authority if the debtor is an employee;
    (9) Any other rights and remedies available to the debtor under the 
statutes or regulations governing the program under which the debt is 
being collected; and

[[Page 90]]

    (10) That, unless otherwise provided by statute or contract, amounts 
collected and later waived or found not owed will be promptly refunded.
    (k) Alternative repayment proposal. A debtor may propose a different 
offset schedule or repayment by cash installments pursuant to Sec. 
30.19.
    (l) Request for hearing. A debtor may submit to the address 
specified in the notice letter a written request for a hearing to 
dispute the administrative determination of the existence or amount of 
the debt, or whether the proposed offset schedule complies with this 
section, before the initiation of collection by offset. The request must 
be postmarked no later than 15 days (unless otherwise provided by 
statute or regulation) from the date the notice was mailed to the 
debtor. The debtor must sign the request and briefly state each agency 
conclusion being disputed and the reasons for the dispute. Supporting 
facts, witnesses, and documents must be identified in the request. The 
request, with supporting documents, must, on its face, sufficiently 
raise a genuine issue of fact or law. Receipt of the request will be 
acknowledged. The Secretary may grant an extension or excuse a delay if 
the debtor shows good cause for late filing of a request for a hearing. 
A reasonable extension will be granted only if the debtor shows that the 
delay was caused by circumstances beyond the debtor's control or because 
the debtor did not receive notice, and was not otherwise aware of the 
time limit. A debtor who fails to meet the filing deadline or to request 
an extension waives the right to a hearing and will be immediately 
subject to offset.
    (m) Denial of request. The Secretary will summarily deny a request 
for an oral hearing pursuant to a written finding that the request 
raises no genuine issue of fact or law, or is otherwise spurious or 
frivolous. In addition, if the Secretary finds that the request raises 
issues which may properly constitute grounds for waiver of the debt 
under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or any other statute, the request will be deemed to 
be a request for a waiver and will be so handled with notification to 
the debtor.
    (n) Hearings--(1) Type of hearing. The hearing will normally be a 
review of the record, unless the hearing officer determines that a 
decision cannot be made without resolving an issue of credibility or 
veracity, in which case the hearing officer will provide for an oral 
hearing.
    (2) Date and place of oral hearing. The oral hearing will normally 
be held no later than 30 days from the date of receipt by the agency of 
the request for a hearing. The hearing officer will give the debtor and 
the Secretary at least 10 days prior notice of the hearing date, time, 
place, procedures and issues. The hearing officer, for good cause, may 
grant the parties each one request to change the hearing date and 
reschedule the hearing for the earliest practical date. To the extent 
feasible the hearing will be held at a location convenient to the 
debtor, and will be open to the public.
    (3) Oral hearing procedures. The hearing officer will:
    (i) Make a summary record of the hearing;
    (ii) Decide the order of hearing the evidence;
    (iii) Allow the debtor and the agency to introduce relevant evidence 
not previously submitted and informally call and cross examine 
witnesses;
    (iv) Question parties and witnesses as appropriate;
    (v) Allow the debtor and the agency to be represented by counsel; 
and
    (vi) Limit review of the case to the particulars of the agency 
determination challenged by the debtor.
    (o) Decision of hearing officer. The hearing officer will issue a 
written decision at the earliest practical date; but not later than 60 
days after a request for a hearing or extension is filed under 5 U.S.C. 
5514. The decision will, at a minimum, state the relevant facts, include 
the hearing officer's analysis, findings and conclusions based on the 
issues and, if unfavorable to the debtor, inform the debtor of any 
available rights or remedies.
    (p) Employee waiver requests. Requests for waiver of overpayments of 
pay under 5 U.S.C. 5584 will continue to be handled under 4 CFR parts 
91-93 and Chapter 4-40 of the HHS General Administration Manual, except 
that a waiver request made simultaneously

[[Page 91]]

with, or during the pendency of a request for review under this section 
may be referred for a decision under the waiver standards to the hearing 
officer reviewing the debt under this section.
    (q) Deductions. Unless an alternative repayment arrangement has been 
accepted, the Secretary may initiate offset 30 days after the date that 
notice of the proposed action was mailed to the debtor if no review or 
hearing is pending, or as soon as practical after a hearing officer's 
decision affirming the debt.
    (r) Protection of the Government's interest. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of paragraphs (j) through (q) of this section, the Secretary 
may take immediate action to delay a lump sum or final payment to the 
debtor whenever such action is necessary to protect the Government's 
ability to recover the debt by offset. The amount withheld may not 
exceed the amount of the debt plus any accrued or anticipated interest, 
administrative cost charges and penalties. The Secretary shall promptly 
send the debtor the notice specified in paragraph (j) of this section. 
The Secretary may not take final action to effect offset of the debt 
from the withheld amount until the procedures required by paragraphs (j) 
through (l) of this section have been exhausted. The appropriate amount 
will be paid to the debtor as soon as practical after the debt, or a 
portion of the debt, is found not to be owed.
    (s) Interagency offsets. The Secretary may offset a debt owed to 
another Federal agency from amounts due or payable by the Department to 
the debtor; or request another Federal agency to offset a debt owed to 
the Department. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3720a, Department of the Treasury 
regulations, 26 CFR part 301, and HHS' implementing regulations, 45 CFR 
part 31, the Secretary may seek to offset an overdue debt from a Federal 
income tax refund due the debtor where reasonable attempts to obtain 
payment from the debtor have failed.
    (1) In attempting to collect a debt from an employee of another 
Federal agency by deduction from the debtor's pay, the Secretary will 
follow the procedures set forth in this section. When those procedures 
are exhausted, a written request for offset will be submitted to the 
employing agency. The request will--
    (i) Certify that the debt is valid;
    (ii) Certify the amount and basis of the debt;
    (iii) Certify the date the Government's right to collect the debt 
first accrued;
    (iv) Certify that this section has been approved by OPM;
    (v) Either--
    (A) Certify that the procedures required by this section have been 
complied with;
    (B) Include the employee's written consent to the offset or 
acknowledgment of receipt of the required procedures; or
    (C) If the debt is reduced to judgment, include a copy of the court 
judgment; and
    (vi) Indicate whether collection is to be made in a lump sum or by 
installments and the number, amount and beginning date of the 
installments.
    (2)(i) The Secretary may deduct from an employee's pay a debt owed 
to another Federal agency in accordance with this section. The creditor 
agency must submit the properly certified claim form described in 
paragraph (s)(1) of this section. No deductions will be made until a 
properly completed claim form is received.
    (ii) Before initiating deductions, the Secretary must send the 
employee a letter:
    (A) Transmitting a copy of the creditor agency's request;
    (B) Notifying the employee of the proposed action;
    (C) Instructing the employee to contact the creditor agency 
regarding payment or any dispute of the debt, the certification or the 
proposed collection; and
    (D) Informing the employee of the date that deduction will begin 
(which should be at the next officially established pay interval) and 
that deductions will continue until the debt is paid unless the creditor 
agency directs otherwise.
    (iii) The creditor agency must resolve any disputes concerning the 
debt or the offset and promptly inform the Department of any 
circumstances affecting the collection by offset. The

[[Page 92]]

Department may not review the merits of the creditor agency's decisions.
    (iv) The Secretary may temporarily withhold lump sum or final leave 
payments to the employee who is in the process of separating or to a 
former employee for no more than 30 days beyond normal processing time 
periods pending certification.
    (v) If the employee subject to salary offset is in the process of 
separating, and is entitled to payment from the Civil Service Retirement 
and Disability Fund, the Secretary will send OPM a copy of the creditor 
agency's original offset request. If the employee transfers to another 
Federal agency, the Secretary will certify in writing the total amount 
collected on the debt and send one copy of the certification to the 
employee and another to the creditor agency, with notice of the 
transfer. A copy of the certification, along with the creditor agency's 
original offset request will be inserted in the employee's official 
personnel folder.
    (vi) When a new Department employee transfers from another Federal 
agency and the employee's official personnel folder contains a creditor 
agency's offset request to the former employing agency and the former 
employing agency's certification of the amount of the debt already 
collected, the Secretary will resume collection by offset. If either 
item is missing, the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (s)(1).
    (t) Non-waiver of debtor rights by payment. Unless a statute or 
contract provides otherwise, a debtor does not waive any rights under 
law or contract by paying all or part of a debt by offset or cash 
payment.

<R05>
Sec. 30.16  Use of credit reporting agencies.

    (a) Overdue debts. (1) The Secretary will report overdue debts over 
$100 owed by individuals and all debts over $100 owed by business 
concerns and private non-profit organizations to consumer or commercial 
credit reporting agencies. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, beneficiary debts which arise under the Social Security 
Act may be reported under this section.
    (2) Debts owed by individuals, except debts arising under the Social 
Security Act, will be reported to consumer reporting agencies as defined 
in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12) and 31 U.S.C. 
3711(f). The Secretary must first give the individual, but not the 
corporate debtor at least 60 days' written notice that the debt is 
overdue and will be reported to a credit reporting agency (including the 
specific information that will be disclosed); that the debtor may 
dispute the accuracy and validity of the information being disclosed; 
and, if a previous opportunity was not provided, that the debtor may 
request review of the debt or rescheduling of payment. The Secretary may 
disclose only the individual's name, address and Social Security number, 
and the nature, amount, status and history of the debt.
    (3) Unless specifically authorized by statute, regulation or written 
agreement, or unless the debts arise from, or involve, fraud or criminal 
activity, overdue debts arising from payments to beneficaries under 
Titles II, XVI and XVIII of the Social Security Act will not be reported 
to credit reporting agencies. All other overdue debts of individuals 
which arise under the Social Security Act may be reported to credit 
reporting agencies subject to the conditions stated in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, except that such disclosure would be as a routine use 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3), rather than a disclosure under 552a(b)(12).
    (b) Credit reports and locator services. The Secretary may also use 
credit reporting agencies to obtain credit reports to evaluate the 
financial status of loan applicants and potential contractors and 
grantees; to obtain credit reports when collecting or disposing of debts 
to determine a debtor's ability to repay a debt; and to locate debtors. 
In the case of an individual, the Secretary may disclose, as a routine 
use under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3), only the individual's name, address, 
Social Security number and the purpose for which the information will be 
used.
    (c) Disclosures pertaining to individuals may be made to credit 
reporting agencies generally from the primary

[[Page 93]]

systems of records containing information about the debt or the loan, 
contract or grant application.
    (d) Addresses obtained from the Internal Revenue Service may be 
disclosed to credit reporting agencies only to obtain credit reports 
(see Sec. 30.21).


<R05>
Sec. 30.17  Contracting for collection services.

    (a) Rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Secretary may contract for collection services to recover outstanding 
debts and may pay the contractor's fee from the amounts collected, from 
funds specifically available for that purpose, or from a revolving fund. 
The amount of the fee must be consistent with prevailing commercial 
practice. The Secretary may contract for collection services only if 
reasonable in-house collection efforts and remedies were, or are likely 
to be, unsuccessful or not feasible; and the total amount of anticipated 
recoveries exceeds the total cost of the contract and incidental 
expenses. The Secretary must retain the authority to resolve disputes, 
compromise debts, terminate collection action (or recommend such action 
to the Department of Justice) and refer debts to the Department of 
Justice for litigation. Contracts for collection services must conform 
to the standards set forth in the Federal and Departmental Acquisitions 
Regulations at 48 CFR, Chapters 1 and 3. The Secretary may disclose to 
the contractor the information about debtors necessary to accomplish the 
purpose of the contract. The contractor must provide any data from its 
files relating to the account to the Secretary upon request or upon 
return of the account. The contractor will be subject to the Privacy Act 
of 1974, as amended, as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable 
Federal and State laws and regulations regarding debt collection 
practices, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 
1692. The contractor will be strictly accountable for all amounts 
collected.
    (b) Social Security Act debts. (1) A contractor's fee for collecting 
debts arising under the Social Security Act may be paid from any funds 
available for that purpose, but not from the amounts collected unless 
those amounts belong to a revolving fund.
    (2) Unless specifically authorized by statute, regulation or written 
agreement, or unless the debts arise from, or involve, fraud or criminal 
activity, debts arising from payments to beneficiaries under Titles II, 
XVI and XVIII of the Social Security Act will not be referred to private 
collection agencies for collection.


<R05>
Sec. 30.18  Liquidation of collateral.

    If the Secretary holds a security instrument with a power of sale or 
has physical possession of collateral, the Secretary will liquidate the 
security or collateral when it is cost-effective to do so and apply the 
proceeds to an overdue debt. The Secretary will give the debtor 
reasonable notice of the sale and an accounting of any surplus proceeds 
and will comply with other requirements under law or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 30.19  Installment payments.

    The Secretary may enter into a written agreement with a debtor for 
payment of a debt in regular installments if payment in one lump sum, 
either by cash or offset, will cause the debtor extreme financial 
hardship. The debtor must submit sufficient information to determine his 
or her ability to pay. A request by a debtor for installment payment 
will delay initiation of offset under Sec. 30.15 only if the request is 
in writing, is accompanied by a statement with supporting documents 
indicating how the proposed offset would cause extreme financial 
hardship and, unless an extension is granted for good cause, is received 
by the Secretary no later than 15 days (unless otherwise provided by 
statute or regulation) from the date that notice of the proposed offset 
was mailed to the debtor. The Secretary will consider factors such as 
the amount of the debt, the length of the proposed repayment period, 
whether the debtor is willing to sign a confess-judgment note or give 
collateral, past dealings with the debtor and documentation indicating 
that the offset will cause the debtor extreme financial hardship and 
that the debtor will be financially capable of adhering to the terms of 
the agreement. The size and

[[Page 94]]

frequency of the payments will reasonably relate to the size of the debt 
and the debtor's present and future ability to pay. Whenever feasible, 
the installment agreement will provide for full payment of the debt, 
including interest and charges, in three years or less, and include a 
security or confess judgment provision. The full balance, including 
accrued interest, charges and penalties, will be immediately due and 
payable if the debtor defaults on any installment made pursuant to a 
repayment agreement. Interest under installment agreements will be 
payable at the applicable rate as provided in Sec. 30.13. When a debtor 
owes several debts and does not designate how an installment payment 
should be applied as among the various debts, the payment will be 
applied in accordance with Sec. 30.15(f).

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0990-0148)


<R05>
Sec. 30.20  Taxpayer information.

    (a) The Secretary shall enter into reimbursable agreements with the 
Internal Revenue Service in accordance with IRS Revenue Procedure 83-29, 
26 CFR 601.702, to obtain the current mailing addresses of debtors and 
to find out whether applicants under included Federal loan programs have 
overdue tax accounts.
    (b) ``Included Federal loan program'' means any program under which 
the Department makes, guarantees or insures loans and which appears in 
the current list of included Federal loan programs published by the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Federal Register. 
An applicant for a loan under an included Federal loan program 
administered by the Department must furnish his or her taxpayer 
identification number, which, for an individual, means the Social 
Security number.
    (c) Tax delinquency information may not be redisclosed or used for 
any other purpose. Addresses obtained from the Internal Revenue Service 
may be used by the Department, its officers, employees, agents or 
contractors and other Federal agencies to collect or dispose of debts, 
but may be disclosed to consumer reporting agencies only to obtain 
credit reports, unless otherwise independently verified.


<R05>
Sec. 30.21  Army hold-up list.

    The Secretary may use the Army hold-up list to report indebted 
contractors to the Department of the Army for inclusion in the list and 
to check whether a prospective contractor is indebted to another agency. 
The reported information will be limited to the contractor's name, 
address and taxpayer identification number if available, and the amount 
of the debt. The Secretary will promptly report any partial or full 
satisfaction or waiver of a reported debt and will screen the hold-up 
list periodically and request removal of any debt of less than $1,000 
that has been on the list for over twelve months.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Compromise of Claims


<R05>
Sec. 30.22  Compromise rule.

    The Secretary may attempt to dispose of debts, including accrued 
interest, charges and penalties, by compromise settlement whenever the 
Department's ability to collect the full amount is uncertain because of 
the debtor's financial status or the litigation risks or because 
enforced collection would not be cost-effective. When the outstanding 
principal amount of the debt before compromise exceeds $20,000 and the 
debtor has exhausted all Departmental administrative remedies, the debt 
may be compromised only with the approval of the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 30.23  Exceptions.

    The Secretary may not compromise debts--
    (a) Which arise out of exceptions made by the General Accounting 
Office in the accounts of accountable officers (only the General 
Accounting Office has authority to compromise such debts); or
    (b) Where there is an indication of fraud, the presentation of a 
false claim or misrepresentation by the debtor or any other party having 
an interest in the claim, or where the claim is based on conduct in 
violation of antitrust laws. (Only the Department of Justice has 
authority to compromise or terminate collection of these claims.)

[[Page 95]]


<R05>
Sec. 30.24  Inability to collect the full amount.

    (a) The Secretary may compromise a debt if the full amount cannot be 
collected because the debtor--
    (1) Is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable time; or
    (2) Refuses to pay the full amount and the Government is unable to 
enforce full collection within a reasonable time.
    (b) Ability to pay. In determining a debtor's ability to pay, the 
Secretary may consider the age and health of the individual debtor; 
present and future income and assets; and the possibility of an improper 
transfer or concealment of assets by the debtor.
    (c) Amount of compromise. The amount of compromise will reasonably 
relate to the amount recoverable by enforced action, considering such 
factors as State or Federal exemptions available to the debtor, and the 
price that collateral will bring at a forced sale.
    (d) Installments. Compromises will be paid in one lump sum whenever 
possible. Payment by installments may be accepted on a case-by-case 
basis bearing in mind the conditions specified in Sec. 30.20.
    (e) Credit information. If reasonably up-to-date credit information 
to evaluate a compromise proposal is not available, the Secretary may 
obtain credit reports from credit reporting agencies or a statement from 
the debtor executed under penalty of perjury showing the debtor's assets 
and liabilities, income and expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 30.25  Litigative probabilities.

    The Secretary may compromise a debt if the Government's ability to 
prove its case in court for the full amount claimed is doubtful either 
because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the 
facts. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases should fairly 
reflect the probability of prevailing on the issues and the prospects 
for full or partial recovery of a judgment, paying due regard to the 
availability of evidence and witnesses, and related pragmatic 
considerations.


<R05>
Sec. 30.26  Cost of collecting claim.

    The Secretary may compromise a debt if the cost or deterrence value 
of collection do not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. 
The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an 
appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of 
collection, taking into account the time which it will take to effect 
collection. Costs of collection may be a substantial factor in the 
settlement of small debts, but not normally in the settlement of large 
debts.


<R05>
Sec. 30.27  Enforcement policy.

    Statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts established as an aid to 
enforcement and to compel compliance may be compromised if not 
prohibited by law and consistent with the agency's enforcement policy.


<R05>
Sec. 30.28  Joint and several liability.

    When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, a 
compromise with one debtor will not release the remaining debtors. The 
amount of a compromise with one debtor will not be considered a 
precedent or binding in determining the amount which will be required 
from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 30.29  Further review of compromise offers.

    A debtor's firm written offer of compromise for a substantial amount 
may be referred to the General Accounting Office or to the Department of 
Justice when the acceptability of the offer is in doubt. (See 30.36).


<R05>
Sec. 30.30  Restriction.

    The Secretary may not accept a percentage of a debtor's profits or 
stock in a debtor corporation in compromise of a debt.


<R04>
        Subpart D--Termination or Suspension of Collection Action


<R05>
Sec. 30.31  Termination rule.

    (a) The Secretary may terminate collection activity and write off a 
debt, including accrued interest, charges and

[[Page 96]]

penalties if the outstanding principal does not exceed $20,000 and:
    (1) The Government cannot collect or enforce collection of any 
significant sum from the debtor, having due regard for the judicial 
remedies available to the Government, the debtor's ability to pay (see 
Sec. 30.25(b)) and the exemptions available to the debtor under State 
and Federal law;
    (2) The debtor cannot be located, there is no security remaining to 
be liquidated, the applicable statute of limitations has run, and the 
prospects of collecting by offset are too remote to justify retention of 
the claim;
    (3) The cost of further collection action is likely to exceed the 
recoverable amount;
    (4) The basis for the claim has proved to be unsupportable; or
    (5) The evidence necessary to prove the claim cannot be produced or 
the necessary witnesses are unavailable.
    (b) As required by section 61(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 
income arising from the discharge in whole or in part of a debt is to be 
included in the debtor's gross income for the year in which the debt is 
discharged. The Secretary will report to the Internal Revenue Service, 
using Form 1099G, any amount over $600 which becomes uncollectible 
because the applicable statute of limitations expires or because the 
Government agrees with the debtor to forgive or compromise a debt. An 
amount which is in dispute, which is discharged under Title 11 of the 
Bankruptcy Act or which arises out of an overpayment which was already 
taxed, will not be reported. See IRS Instructions for Form 1096 and 
Revenue Procedure 83-48 for further instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 30.32  Exceptions.

    (a) The Secretary may suspend, rather than terminate collection of a 
debt that arises out of its activities if the outstanding principal does 
not exceed $20,000 and the Government cannot collect or enforce 
collection of any significant sum from the debtor (e.g., the debtor 
cannot be located or is financially unable to pay), but the prospects of 
future collection are promising enough to justify periodic review of the 
debt, and there is no statute of limitations problem. Interest will 
accrue under Sec. 30.13(a).
    (b) Where a significant enforcement policy is involved, the 
Secretary will, instead of terminating or suspending collection, refer 
debts to the Department of Justice for litigation.


<R04>
        Subpart E--Referrals to the Department of Justice or GAO


<R05>
Sec. 30.33  Litigation.

    (a) Debts over $600 that cannot be collected or otherwise disposed 
of by the Secretary or its agents will be referred to the appropriate 
United States Attorney (if the amount does not exceed $100,000) or the 
Civil Division of the Department of Justice (if the amount exceeds 
$100,000) for litigation. Each referral will include all pertinent 
information, as required by the Claims Collection Litigation Report, 
including:
    (1) The most current address of the debtor or the name and address 
of the agent for a corporation upon whom service may be made;
    (2) Reasonably current credit data in the form of a credit report or 
a financial statement showing reasonable prospects of enforcing 
collection from the debtor, having due regard for the exemptions 
available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial 
remedies available to the Government; and
    (3) A summary of prior collection efforts. Credit data may be 
omitted if a surety bond, insurance, or the sale of collateral will 
satisfy the claim in full; or the debtor is in bankruptcy or 
receivership, or is a unit of State or local government.
    (b) Debts of $600 or less, exclusive of interest and charges, may be 
referred for litigation if a significant enforcement policy is involved 
or the debtor is clearly able to pay and the Government can effectively 
enforce payment.


<R05>
Sec. 30.34  Claims over $20,000.

    The Secretary may compromise or suspend or terminate collection of 
debts where the outstanding principal exceeds $20,000 only with the 
approval of, or referral to, the appropriate United States Attorney (if 
the debt

[[Page 97]]

does not exceed $100,000) or the Department of Justice (if the debt 
exceeds $100,000).


<R05>
Sec. 30.35  GAO exceptions.

    The Secretary will refer to the General Accounting Office (GAO) 
debts arising from GAO audit exceptions.

    Source: 53 FR 25593, July 8, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 31.1  Scope.

    (a) The standards set forth in Sec.Sec. 31.1 through 31.11 are the 
Department's procedures for requesting the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) to offset tax refunds due taxpayers who have a past due debt 
obligation to the Department. These procedures are authorized by the 
Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (31 U.S.C. 3720A), as implemented by 
regulation at 26 CFR 301.6402-6T, and apply to the collection of debts 
as authorized by common law, by 31 U.S.C. 3716, or under other statutory 
authority.
    (b) The Secretary will use the IRS tax refund offset to collect 
claims which are liquidated or certain in amount, past due and legally 
enforceable, and which are eligible for tax refund offset under 
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
Secretary will not report debts to the IRS except for the purpose of 
using the offset procedures described in Sec.Sec. 31.1 through 31.11. 
Debts of less than $25.00, exclusive of interest and other charges, will 
not be reported.
    (d) If not legally enforceable because of the lapse of the statute 
of limitations but otherwise valid, a debt amounting to over $600 will 
be reported to the IRS as a discharged debt on Form 1099G. (Form 1099G 
is an information return which government agencies file with the IRS to 
report discharged debt, and the discharged amount is considered as 
income to the taxpayer.) [See Sec. 31.9; 45 CFR 30.31(b).]


<R05>
Sec. 31.2  Notice of requirements before offset.

    A request for reduction of an IRS tax refund will be made only after 
the Secretary makes a determination that an amount is owed and past due 
and provides the debtor with 60 calendar days written notice. The 
Department's Notice of Intent to Collect by IRS Tax Refund Offset 
(Notice of Intent) will state:
    (a) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (b) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 calendar days from the 
date of the Department's Notice of Intent, the Secretary intends to 
collect the debt by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to 
the debtor as refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal to the 
amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges;
    (c) That the debtor has a right to obtain review, within the 
Department, of the Secretary's initial determination that the debt is 
past due and legally enforceable (See Sec. 31.3); and
    (d) That the debtor has a right to inspect and copy departmental 
records related to the debt as determined by the Secretary and will be 
informed as to where and when the inspection and copying can be done 
after the Department receives notice from the debtor that inspection and 
copying are requested (See Sec. 31.5).

[[Page 98]]


<R05>
Sec. 31.3  Review within the Department of a determination that an amount 
is past due and legally enforceable.

    (a) Notification by debtor. A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent 
has the right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not 
past due or not legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor 
shall send a letter notifying the applicable delegatee of the HHS 
Departmental Claims Officer specified in Sec. 31.11 that the debtor 
intends to present evidence to a designated hearing officer. The letter 
must be received by such designated claims officer within 60 calendar 
days from the date of the Department's Notice of Intent.
    (b) Submission of evidence. The debtor may submit evidence showing 
that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable 
along with the notification required by paragraph (a) of this section. 
Failure to submit the notification and evidence within 60 calendar days 
will result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without 
further action. Evidence submitted by a debtor who has requested prior 
review of a claim under 45 CFR part 30 will not be reconsidered unless 
such evidence raises a new defense not considered in connection with 
such prior review.
    (c) Review of the record. After a timely submission of evidence by 
the debtor, the claims officer will submit such evidence to a designated 
hearing officer, who will review all material related to the debt which 
is in possession of the Department. The hearing officer shall make a 
determination based upon a review of the written record, except that the 
hearing officer may order an oral hearing if the officer finds that:
    (1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Secretary to 
consider waiver of the indebtedness and the waiver determination turns 
on credibility or veracity; or
    (2) The question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the 
documentary evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 31.4  Determination of the hearing officer.

    (a) Following the hearing or the review of the record, the hearing 
officer shall issue a written decision which includes the supporting 
rationale for the decision. The decision of the hearing officer 
concerning whether a debt or part of a debt is past due and legally 
enforceable is the final agency decision with respect to the past due 
status and enforceability of the debt.
    (b) Copies of the hearing officer's decision will be distributed to 
the designated claims officer, the Department's Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Management and Budget, the debtor, and the debtor's 
attorney or other representative, if any.
    (c) If the hearing officer's decision affirms that all or part of 
the debt is past due and legally enforceable, the Secretary will notify 
the IRS after the hearing officer's determination has been issued under 
paragraph (a) of this section and a copy of the determination is 
received by the Department's Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Management and Budget. No referral will be made to the IRS if review of 
the debt by the hearing officer reverses the initial decision that the 
debt is past due and legally enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 31.5  Review of departmental records related to the debt.

    (a) Notification by debtor. A debtor who intends to inspect or copy 
departmental records related to the debt as determined by the Secretary 
must send a letter to the designated claims officer stating the debtor's 
intention. The letter must be received by the designated claims officer 
within 60 calendar days from the date of the Department's Notice of 
Intent.
    (b) Department's response. In response to timely notification by the 
debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the designated 
claims officer will notify the debtor of the location and time when the 
debtor may inspect or copy departmental records related to the debt. At 
his or her discretion, the designated claims officer may also mail 
copies of the debt-related records to the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 31.6  Stay of offset.

    If the debtor timely notifies the Secretary that the debtor is 
exercising a right described in Sec. 31.3(a) and timely submits evidence 
pursuant to Sec. 31.3(b), any notice to the IRS will be stayed

[[Page 99]]

until the issuance of a written decision by the hearing officer which 
determines that a debt or part of a debt is past due and legally 
enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 31.7  Application of offset funds: Single debt.

    If the debtor does not timely notify the Secretary that the debtor 
is exercising a right described in Sec. 31.3, the Secretary will notify 
the IRS of the debt 60 calendar days from the date of the Department's 
Notice of Intent, and will request that the amount of the debt be offset 
against any amount payable by the IRS as refund of Federal taxes paid. 
Normally, recovered funds will be applied first to any special charges 
provided for in HHS regulations or contracts, then to interest, and 
finally, to the principal owed by the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 31.8  Application of offset funds: Multiple debts.

    The Secretary will use the procedures set out in Sec. 31.7 for the 
offset of multiple debts. However, when collecting on multiple debts the 
Secretary will apply the recovered amounts against the debts in order in 
which the debts accrued.


<R05>
Sec. 31.9  Application of offset funds: Tax refund insufficient to cover 
amount of debt.

    If a tax refund is insufficient to satisfy a debt in a given tax 
year, the Secretary will recertify to the IRS on the following year to 
collect further on the debt. If, in the following year, the debt has 
become legally unenforceable because of the lapse of the statute of 
limitations, the debt will be reported to the IRS as a discharged debt 
in accordance with Sec. 31.1(d) and 45 CFR 30.31(b).


<R05>
Sec. 31.10  Time limitation for notifying the IRS to request offset of tax 
refunds due.

    (a) The Secretary may not initiate offset of tax refunds due to 
collect a debt for which authority to collect arises under 31 U.S.C. 
3716 more than 10 years after the Secretary's right to collect the debt 
first accrued, unless facts material to the Secretary's right to collect 
the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the 
officials of the Department who were responsible for discovering and 
collecting such debts.
    (b) When the debt first accrued is determined according to existing 
law regarding the accrual of debts. (See, for example, 28 U.S.C. 2415.)


<R05>
Sec. 31.11  Correspondence with the Department.

    (a) All correspondence from the debtor to the Secretary concerning

<R05>
Sec. 32.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. This part prescribes the standards and procedures for 
the Department to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means 
of administrative wage garnishment to satisfy delinquent non-tax debts 
owed to the United States.
    (b) Authority. These standards and procedures are authorized under 
the wage garnishment provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act 
of 1996, codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D, and the Department of the Treasury 
Administrative Wage Garnishment Regulations at 31 CFR 285.11.
    (c) Scope. (1) This part applies to all Departmental Operating 
Divisions and Regional Offices that administer a program that gives rise 
to a delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States and to all 
officers or employees of the Department authorized to collect such debt.
    (2) This part shall apply notwithstanding any provision of State 
law.
    (3) Nothing in this part precludes the compromise of a debt or the 
suspension or termination of collection action in accordance with part 
30 of this title, or other applicable law or regulation.
    (4) The receipt of payments pursuant to this part does not preclude 
the Department from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including 
the offset of Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed 
to the United States. The Department may pursue such debt collection 
remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative wage 
garnishment.
    (5) This part does not apply to the collection of delinquent non-tax 
debts owed to the United States from the wages of Federal employees from 
their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal salary 
offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws.
    (6) Nothing in this part requires the Department to duplicate 
notices or administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws 
or regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 32.2  Definitions.

    In this part, unless the context otherwise requires:
    Business day means Monday through Friday. For purposes of 
computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a 
Federal legal holiday, in which case the next business day following the 
holiday will be considered the last day of the period.
    Certificate of service means a certificate signed by an employee of 
the Department indicating the nature of the document to which it 
pertains, the date of mailing of the document, and to whom it is being 
sent.
    Day means calendar day. For purposes of computation, the last day of 
the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a 
Federal legal holiday, in which case the next business day will be 
considered the last day of the period.
    Debt or claim means an amount of money, funds, or property that has 
been determined by the Secretary to be owed to the United States by an 
individual, including debt administered by a third party as an agent of 
the Federal Government. A debt or claim includes, but is not limited to: 
amounts owed on account of loans made, insured or guaranteed by the 
Federal Government, including any deficiency or difference between the 
price obtained by the Federal Government upon selling the property and 
the amount owed to the Federal Government; overpayments to program 
beneficiaries; any amount the

[[Page 101]]

Federal Government is authorized by statute to collect for the benefit 
of any person; the unpaid share of any non-Federal partner in a program 
involving a Federal payment, including a matching or cost-sharing 
payment of the non-Federal partner; any fine, civil penalty or 
assessment; and other amounts or money or property owed to the Federal 
Government.
    Debtor means an individual who owes a delinquent non-tax debt to the 
United States.
    Delinquent debt means any non-tax debt that has not been paid by the 
date specified in the Department's initial written demand for payment, 
or applicable payment agreement or instrument, unless other satisfactory 
payment arrangements have been made. For purposes of this part, 
``delinquent'' and ``overdue'' have the same meaning.
    Department means the United States Department of I-Iealth and 1--
luman Services, including each of its Operating Divisions and Regional 
Offices.
    Disposable pay means that part of the debtor's compensation 
(including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and 
vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health 
insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For 
purposes of this part, ``amounts required by law to be withheld'' 
include amounts for deductions such as social security taxes and 
withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld pursuant to a 
court order.
    Employer means a person or entity that employs the services of 
others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer 
includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does 
not include an agency of the Federal Government as defined by 31 CFR 
285.11(c).
    Garnishment means the process of withholding amounts from an 
employee's disposable pay and paying those amounts to a creditor in 
satisfaction of a withholding order.
    Hearing means a review of the documentary evidence concerning the 
existence or amount of a debt, or the terms of a repayment schedule, 
provided such repayment schedule is established other than by a written 
agreement entered into pursuant to this part. If the hearing official 
determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved solely by 
review of the written record, such as when the validity of the debt 
turns on the issue of credibility or veracity, an oral hearing may be 
provided.
    Hearing official means any qualified individual, as determined by 
the Secretary, including a Departmental Appeals Board administrative law 
judge.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the 
Secretary's designee within the Department.
    Withholding order for purposes of this part means ``Wage Garnishment 
Order (SF329B).'' Also for purposes of this part, the terms ``wage 
garnishment order'' and ``garnishment order'' have the same meaning as 
``withholding order.''


<R05>
Sec. 32.3  General rule.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whenever a 
delinquent debt is owed by an individual, the Secretary, or another 
federal agency collecting a debt on the Department's behalf (See 45 CFR 
part 30), may initiate proceedings administratively to garnish the wages 
of the delinquent debtor.
    (b) The Secretary may not garnish the wages of a debtor who the 
Secretary knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until 
the debtor has been re-employed continuously for at least 12 months. The 
debtor has the burden of informing the Secretary of the circumstances 
surrounding an involuntary separation from employment.


<R05>
Sec. 32.4  Notice.

    (a) Notice requirements. At least 30 days before the initiation of 
garnishment proceedings, the Secretary shall mail, by first class mail, 
to the debtor's last known address a written notice informing the debtor 
of:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) The intention of the Secretary to initiate proceedings to 
collect the debt through deductions from pay until the

[[Page 102]]

debt and all accumulated interest, penalties, and administrative costs 
are paid in full;
    (3) The debtor's right--
    (i) To inspect and copy Department records related to the debt;
    (ii) To enter into a written repayment agreement with the Department 
under terms agreeable to the Department;
    (iii) To a hearing, in accordance with Sec. 32.5, concerning the 
existence or the amount of the debt or the terms of the proposed 
repayment schedule under the garnishment order, except that the debtor 
is not entitled to a hearing concerning the proposed repayment schedule 
if the terms were established by written agreement pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section; and
    (4) The time frames within which the debtor may exercise his or her 
rights.
    (b) The Secretary will keep a copy of the dated notice. The notice 
may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is 
sufficient for evidentiary purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 32.5  Hearing.

    (a) In general. Upon timely written request of the debtor, the 
Secretary shall provide a hearing, which at the Department's option may 
be oral or written, concerning the existence or amount of the debt, or 
the terms of a repayment schedule established other than by written 
agreement under Sec. 32.4(a)(3)(ii).
    (b) Request for hearing. (1) The request for a hearing must be 
signed by the debtor, state each issue being disputed, and identify and 
explain with reasonable specificity all facts and evidence that the 
debtor believes supports the debtor's position. Supporting documentation 
identified by the debtor should be attached to the request.
    (2) Effect of timely request. Subject to paragraph (j) of this 
section, if the debtor's written request is received on or before the 
15th business day following the mailing of the written notice required 
under this part, a withholding order shall not be issued under Sec. 32.6 
until the debtor has been provided the requested hearing and a decision 
in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section has been 
rendered.
    (3) Failure to timely request a hearing. If the debtor's written 
request is received after the 15th business day following the mailing of 
the written notice required under this part, the Secretary shall provide 
a hearing to the debtor. However, the Secretary shall not delay the 
issuance of a withholding order unless the Secretary determines that the 
delay in submitting such request was caused by factors beyond the 
control of the debtor, or the Secretary receives information that the 
Secretary determines justifies a delay or cancellation of the 
withholding order.
    (c) Oral hearing. (1) For purposes of this section, a debtor shall 
be provided a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the 
hearing official determines that the issues in dispute cannot be 
resolved by review of the documentary evidence, such as when the 
validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.
    (2) If the hearing official determines an oral hearing is 
appropriate, the hearing official will establish the date, time and 
location of the hearing. At the debtor's option, the oral hearing may be 
conducted in person or by telephone conference. The hearing official 
will notify the debtor of the date, time, and in the case of an in-
person hearing, the location of the hearing. All travel expenses 
incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be 
borne by the debtor.
    (d) Paper hearing. (1) If the hearing official determines an oral 
hearing is not required by this section, the hearing official shall 
afford the debtor a paper hearing, that is, the issues in dispute will 
be decided based upon a review of the written record.
    (2) The hearing official shall notify the debtor of the deadline for 
the submission of additional evidence if necessary for a review of the 
record.
    (e) Burden of proof. (1) The Secretary has the initial burden of 
proving the existence or amount of the debt.
    (2) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of 
the debt, the debtor must present by a preponderance of the evidence 
that no debt exists or that the amount is incorrect. When challenging 
the terms of a repayment schedule, the debtor must establish by a 
preponderance of the evidence

[[Page 103]]

that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause 
financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not 
be pursued due to operation of law.
    (f) Record. The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of 
any hearing provided under this part. A hearing is not required to be a 
formal evidentiary-type hearing, but witnesses who testify in an oral 
hearing must do so under oath or affirmation.
    (g) Date of decision. (1) The hearing official shall issue a written 
decision, as soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days 
after the date on which the request for the hearing was received by the 
Department.
    (2) If the hearing official is unable to provide the debtor with a 
hearing and render a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the 
request for such hearing:
    (i) A withholding order may not be issued until the hearing is held 
and a decision is rendered; or
    (ii) A withholding order previously issued to the debtor's employer 
must be suspended beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the 
hearing request and continuing until a hearing is held and a decision is 
rendered.
    (h) Content of decision. The written decision shall include:
    (1) A summary of the facts presented;
    (2) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and
    (3) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.
    (i) Final agency action. The hearing official's decision will be the 
final agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the 
Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.
    (j) Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor 
who fails to appear at a hearing will be deemed as not having timely 
filed a request for a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 32.6  Withholding order.

    (a) Unless the Secretary receives information that the Secretary 
determines justifies a delay or cancellation of a withholding order, the 
Secretary shall send, by first class mail, an SF-329A ``Letter to 
Employer & Important Notice to Employer,'' an SF-329B ``Wage Garnishment 
Order,'' an SF-329C ``Wage Garnishment Worksheet,'' and an SF-329D 
``Employer Certification,'' to the debtor's employer within 30 days 
after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing, i.e., 
within 15 business days after mailing the notice required under this 
part, or, if the timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, 
within 30 days after a final decision is made by the Secretary to 
proceed with garnishment.
    (b) The Secretary shall keep a copy of the dated letter to the 
employer and a copy of the wage garnishment order. The certificate of 
service may be retained electronically so long as the manner of 
retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 32.7  Certification by employer.

    The employer must complete and return the SF-329D, ``Employer 
Certification'' to the Department within 20 days of receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 32.8  Amounts withheld.

    (a) After receipt of a withholding order issued under this part, the 
employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the debtor during 
each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraph (b) of 
this section. The employer may use the SF-329C ``Wage Garnishment 
Worksheet'' to calculate the amount to be deducted from the debtor's 
disposable pay.
    (b) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of 
garnishment shall be the lesser of:
    (1) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the 
debtor's disposable pay; or
    (2) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Maximum allowable 
garnishment). The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount 
by which a debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to 
thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, when 
a debtor's pay is subject to multiple withholding orders, unless 
otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders issued pursuant to 
this part shall have priority over other withholding orders that are 
served later in time.

[[Page 104]]

    (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, withholding orders for family 
support shall have priority over withholding orders issued under this 
part.
    (3) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a 
withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order 
issued pursuant to this part, or if a withholding order for family 
support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld 
pursuant to a withholding order issued under this part shall be the 
lesser of:
    (i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, or
    (ii) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the 
amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.
    (d) If the debtor owes more than one debt to the Department, the 
Secretary may issue multiple withholding orders provided that the total 
amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders does not exceed 
the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) or (c) 
of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.
    (f) The employer shall promptly pay to the Department all amounts 
withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to 
this part.
    (g) The employer is not required to vary its normal pay and 
disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.
    (h) Any assignment or allotment by an employee shall be void to the 
extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding 
order issued under this part, except for any assignment or allotment 
made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.
    (i) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the 
debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives 
notification from the Secretary to discontinue wage withholding.
    (j) The withholding order, SF-329B ``Wage Garnishment Order,'' sent 
to the employer under Sec. 32.6, requires the employer to commence wage 
withholding on the first pay day after the employer receives the order. 
However, if the first pay day is within 10 days after receipt of the 
order, the employer may begin deductions on the second pay day.
    (k) An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take 
disciplinary action against an debtor a result of the issuance of a 
withholding order under this part.

[68 FR 15093, Mar. 28, 2003; 68 FR 24052, May 6, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 32.9  Financial hardship.

    (a) A debtor whose wages are subject to a withholding order may, at 
any time, request a review by the Department of the amount garnished, 
based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, 
or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship.
    (b) A debtor requesting such a review under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall submit the basis for claiming that the current amount of 
garnishment results in a financial hardship to the debtor, along with 
supporting documentation. The Secretary shall consider any information 
submitted in accordance with this part.
    (c) If a financial hardship is found, the Secretary shall downwardly 
adjust, by an amount and for a period of time established by the 
Secretary, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial 
condition. The Secretary will notify the employer of any adjustments to 
the amount to be withheld.


<R05>
Sec. 32.10  Refunds.

    (a) If the hearing official, pursuant to a hearing under this part, 
determines that a debt is not legally due and owing to the United 
States, the Secretary shall promptly refund any amount collected by 
means of administrative wage garnishment.
    (b) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this 
part shall not bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 32.11  Ending garnishment.

    (a) Once the Department has fully recovered the amounts owed by the 
debtor, including interest, penalties, and administrative costs assessed 
pursuant to and in accordance with part 30 of this title, the Secretary 
shall send the

[[Page 105]]

debtor's employer notification to discontinue wage withholding.
    (b) At least annually, the Secretary shall review its debtors' 
accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts 
that have been paid in full.


<R05>
Sec. 32.12  Right of action.

    (a) The employer of a debtor subject to wage withholding pursuant to 
this part shall pay to the Department as directed in a withholding order 
issued under this part.
    (b) The Secretary may bring suit against an employer for any amount 
that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to a 
debtor in accordance with Sec.Sec. 32.6 and 32.8, plus attorney's fees, 
costs, and, if applicable, punitive damages.
    (c) A suit under this section may not be filed before the 
termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, 
unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable 
statute of limitations period. For purposes of this section, 
``termination of collection action'' occurs when the Secretary has 
terminated collection action in accordance with part 30 of this title, 
or other applicable law or regulation.
    (d) Notwithstanding deemed to occur if from a debtor whose paragraph 
(c) of this section, termination of the collection action will be a 
period of one (1) year the Department does not receive any payments 
wages were subject to a garnishment order issued under this part.

whole or in part, its employees (which for the purpose of this 
regulation includes former employees) for any verdict, judgment or other 
monetary award which is rendered against any

[[Page 109]]

such employee, provided that the conduct giving rise to the verdict,

the United States, as determined by the Secretary, or his or her 
designee, in his or her discretion.
    (c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary 
or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request 
either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before 
entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.
    (d) When an employee of the Department of Health and Human Services 
becomes aware that an action has been filed against the employee in his 
or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope 
of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify the 
Department that such an action is pending.
    (e) The employee may, thereafter, request either (1) indemnification 
to satisfy a verdict, judgment or award entered against the employee or 
(2) payment to satisfy the requirements of a settlement proposal. The 
employee shall submit a written request, with documentation including 
copies of the verdict, judgment, award or settlement proposal, as 
appropriate, to the head of his employing component, who shall thereupon 
submit to the General Counsel, in a timely manner, a recommended 
disposition of the request. The General Counsel shall also seek the 
views of the Department of Justice. The General Counsel shall forward 
the request, the employing component's recommendation and the General 
Counsel's recommendation to the Secretary for decision.
    (f) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Department 
of Health and Human Services employee or to settle a personal damage 
claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of 
the employing component of the Department of Health and Human Services.

<R05>
Sec. 46.101  To what does this policy apply?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this policy 
applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported or 
otherwise subject to regulation by any federal department or agency 
which takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy 
applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by federal 
civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or 
agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be 
appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research 
conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the federal 
government outside the United States.
    (1) Research that is conducted or supported by a federal department 
or agency, whether or not it is regulated as defined in Sec. 46.102(e), 
must comply with all sections of this policy.
    (2) Research that is neither conducted nor supported by a federal 
department or agency but is subject to regulation as defined in Sec. 
46.102(e) must be reviewed and approved, in compliance with Sec. 46.101, 
Sec. 46.102, and Sec. 46.107 through Sec. 46.117 of this policy, by an 
institutional review board (IRB) that operates in accordance with the 
pertinent requirements of this policy.
    (b) Unless otherwise required by department or agency heads, 
research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will 
be in one or more of the following categories are exempt from this 
policy:
    (1) Research conducted in established or commonly accepted 
educational settings, involving normal educational practices, such as 
(i) research on regular and special education instructional strategies, 
or (ii) research on the

[[Page 111]]

effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, 
curricula, or classroom management methods.
    (2) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures or observation of public behavior, unless:
    (i) Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human 
subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to 
the subjects; and (ii) any disclosure of the human subjects' responses 
outside the research could reasonably place the subjects at risk of 
criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial 
standing, employability, or reputation.
    (3) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures, or observation of public behavior that is not exempt under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if:
    (i) The human subjects are elected or appointed public officials or 
candidates for public office; or (ii) federal statute(s) require(s) 
without exception that the confidentiality of the personally 
identifiable information will be maintained throughout the research and 
thereafter.
    (4) Research, involving the collection or study of existing data, 
documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if 
these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded 
by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, 
directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.
    (5) Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or 
subject to the approval of department or agency heads, and which are 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:
    (i) Public benefit or service programs; (ii) procedures for 
obtaining benefits or services under those programs; (iii) possible 
changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or (iv) 
possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or 
services under those programs.
    (6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance 
studies, (i) if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or (ii) 
if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the 
level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or 
environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the 
Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection 
Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture.
    (c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a 
particular activity is covered by this policy.
    (d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research 
activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or 
otherwise subject to regulation by the department or agency but not 
otherwise covered by this policy, comply with some or all of the 
requirements of this policy.
    (e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent 
federal laws or regulations which provide additional protections for 
human subjects.
    (f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or 
regulations which may otherwise be applicable and which provide 
additional protections for human subjects.
    (g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations 
which may otherwise be applicable and which provide additional 
protections to human subjects of research.
    (h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign 
countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to 
protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. 
[An example is a foreign institution which complies with guidelines 
consistent with the World Medical Assembly Declaration (Declaration of 
Helsinki amended 1989) issued either by sovereign states or by an 
organization whose function for the protection of human research 
subjects is internationally recognized.] In these circumstances, if a 
department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by 
the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those 
provided in this policy, the department or agency head

[[Page 112]]

may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the 
procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise 
required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, 
notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the Federal 
Register or will be otherwise published as provided in department or 
agency procedures.
    (i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may 
waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy 
to specific research activities or classes of research activities 
otherwise covered by this policy. Except when otherwise required by 
statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward 
advance notices of these actions to the Office for Protection from 
Research Risks, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and shall 
also publish them in the Federal Register or in such other manner as 
provided in department or agency procedures.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Institutions with HHS-approved assurances on file will abide by 
provisions of title 45 CFR part 46 subparts A-D. Some of the other 
Departments and Agencies have incorporated all provisions of title 45 
CFR part 46 into their policies and procedures as well. However, the 
exemptions at 45 CFR 46.101(b) do not apply to research involving 
prisoners, fetuses, pregnant women, or human in vitro fertilization, 
subparts B and C. The exemption at 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2), for research 
involving survey or interview procedures or observation of public 
behavior, does not apply to research with children, subpart D, except 
for research involving observations of public behavior when the 
investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed.

[56 FR 28012, 28022, June 18, 1991; 56 FR 29756, June 28, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 46.102  Definitions.

    (a) Department or agency head means the head of any federal 
department or agency and any other officer or employee of any department 
or agency to whom authority has been delegated.
    (b) Institution means any public or private entity or agency 
(including federal, state, and other agencies).
    (c) Legally authorized representative means an individual or 
judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on 
behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the 
procedure(s) involved in the research.
    (d) Research means a systematic investigation, including research 
development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute 
to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition 
constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are 
conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for 
other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may 
include research activities.
    (e) Research subject to regulation, and similar terms are intended 
to encompass those research activities for which a federal department or 
agency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research 
activity, (for example, Investigational New Drug requirements 
administered by the Food and Drug Administration). It does not include 
research activities which are incidentally regulated by a federal 
department or agency solely as part of the department's or agency's 
broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether 
research or non-research in nature (for example, Wage and Hour 
requirements administered by the Department of Labor).
    (f) Human subject means a living individual about whom an 
investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research 
obtains
    (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
    (2) Identifiable private information.

Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are 
gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or 
the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. 
Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between 
investigator and subject. Private information includes information about 
behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably 
expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information 
which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which 
the individual can reasonably

[[Page 113]]

expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private 
information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the 
subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or 
associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information 
to constitute research involving human subjects.
    (g) IRB means an institutional review board established in accord 
with and for the purposes expressed in this policy.
    (h) IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the 
research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within 
the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and 
federal requirements.
    (i) Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or 
discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the 
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
    (j) Certification means the official notification by the institution 
to the supporting department or agency, in accordance with the 
requirements of this policy, that a research project or activity 
involving human subjects has been reviewed and approved by an IRB in 
accordance with an approved assurance.


<R05>
Sec. 46.103  Assuring compliance with this policy--research conducted or 
supported by any Federal Department or Agency.

    (a) Each institution engaged in research which is covered by this 
policy and which is conducted or supported by a federal department or 
agency shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or 
agency head that it will comply with the requirements set forth in this 
policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual 
department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current 
assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the 
Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS, and approved for 
federalwide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved 
assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, 
reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to 
department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks, HHS.
    (b) Departments and agencies will conduct or support research 
covered by this policy only if the institution has an assurance approved 
as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified 
to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and 
approved by an IRB provided for in the assurance, and will be subject to 
continuing review by the IRB. Assurances applicable to federally 
supported or conducted research shall at a minimum include:
    (1) A statement of principles governing the institution in the 
discharge of its responsibilities for protecting the rights and welfare 
of human subjects of research conducted at or sponsored by the 
institution, regardless of whether the research is subject to federal 
regulation. This may include an appropriate existing code, declaration, 
or statement of ethical principles, or a statement formulated by the 
institution itself. This requirement does not preempt provisions of this 
policy applicable to department- or agency-supported or regulated 
research and need not be applicable to any research exempted or waived 
under Sec. 46.101 (b) or (i).
    (2) Designation of one or more IRBs established in accordance with 
the requirements of this policy, and for which provisions are made for 
meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and 
recordkeeping duties.
    (3) A list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; 
representative capacity; indications of experience such as board 
certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member's 
chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment 
or other relationship between each member and the institution; for 
example: full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing 
panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant. Changes in IRB 
membership shall be reported to the department or agency head, unless in 
accord

[[Page 114]]

with Sec. 46.103(a) of this policy, the existence of an HHS-approved 
assurance is accepted. In this case, change in IRB membership shall be 
reported to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS.
    (4) Written procedures which the IRB will follow (i) for conducting 
its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its 
findings and actions to the investigator and the institution; (ii) for 
determining which projects require review more often than annually and 
which projects need verification from sources other than the 
investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB 
review; and (iii) for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed 
changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that such changes in 
approved research, during the period for which IRB approval has already 
been given, may not be initiated without IRB review and approval except 
when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.
    (5) Written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, 
appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head 
of (i) any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the 
requirements or determinations of the IRB and (ii) any suspension or 
termination of IRB approval.
    (c) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to 
act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the 
obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and 
manner as the department or agency head prescribes.
    (d) The department or agency head will evaluate all assurances 
submitted in accordance with this policy through such officers and 
employees of the department or agency and such experts or consultants 
engaged for this purpose as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. The department or agency head's evaluation will take 
into consideration the adequacy of the proposed IRB in light of the 
anticipated scope of the institution's research activities and the types 
of subject populations likely to be involved, the appropriateness of the 
proposed initial and continuing review procedures in light of the 
probable risks, and the size and complexity of the institution.
    (e) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the assurance, or enter into negotiations to 
develop an approvable one. The department or agency head may limit the 
period during which any particular approved assurance or class of 
approved assurances shall remain effective or otherwise condition or 
restrict approval.
    (f) Certification is required when the research is supported by a 
federal department or agency and not otherwise exempted or waived under 
Sec. 46.101 (b) or (i). An institution with an approved assurance shall 
certify that each application or proposal for research covered by the 
assurance and by Sec. 46.103 of this Policy has been reviewed and 
approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted with the 
application or proposal or by such later date as may be prescribed by 
the department or agency to which the application or proposal is 
submitted. Under no condition shall research covered by Sec. 46.103 of 
the Policy be supported prior to receipt of the certification that the 
research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Institutions without 
an approved assurance covering the research shall certify within 30 days 
after receipt of a request for such a certification from the department 
or agency, that the application or proposal has been approved by the 
IRB. If the certification is not submitted within these time limits, the 
application or proposal may be returned to the institution.

Sec.Sec. 46.104--46.106  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 46.107  IRB membership.

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying 
backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research 
activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be 
sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its 
members, and the diversity of the

[[Page 115]]

members, including consideration of race, gender, and cultural 
backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to 
promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights 
and welfare of human subjects. In addition to possessing the 
professional competence necessary to review specific research 
activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of 
proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, 
applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The 
IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an 
IRB regularly reviews research that involves a vulnerable category of 
subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, or handicapped or 
mentally disabled persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion 
of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced 
in working with these subjects.
    (b) Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no 
IRB consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the 
institution's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long 
as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No IRB may 
consist entirely of members of one profession.
    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in nonscientific areas.
    (d) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise 
affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate 
family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
    (e) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or 
continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting 
interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
    (f) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with 
competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues which 
require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. 
These individuals may not vote with the IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 46.108  IRB functions and operations.

    In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:
    (a) Follow written procedures in the same detail as described in 
Sec. 46.103(b)(4) and, to the extent required by, Sec. 46.103(b)(5).
    (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (see Sec. 
46.110), review proposed research at convened meetings at which a 
majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one 
member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for 
the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority 
of those members present at the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 46.109  IRB review of research.

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require 
modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research 
activities covered by this policy.
    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects as part 
of informed consent is in accordance with Sec. 46.116. The IRB may 
require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in 
Sec. 46.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the 
information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and 
welfare of subjects.
    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may 
waive documentation in accordance with Sec. 46.117.
    (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing 
of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, 
or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research 
activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall 
include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its 
decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person 
or in writing.
    (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by 
this policy at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less 
than once per

[[Page 116]]

year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe 
the consent process and the research.

<R05>

Sec. 46.110  Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research 
involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved 
research.

    (a) The Secretary, HHS, has established, and published as a Notice 
in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be 
reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will 
be amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and 
agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the 
Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks, National Institutes of Health, HHS, 
Bethesda, Maryland 20892.
    (b) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either 
or both of the following:
    (1) Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by 
the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk,
    (2) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period 
(of one year or less) for which approval is authorized.

Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by 
the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated 
by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the 
research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB 
except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research 
activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the 
non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec. 46.108(b).
    (c) Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a 
method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have 
been approved under the procedure.
    (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, 
or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the 
expedited review procedure.

Sec. 46.111  Criteria for IRB approval of research.

    (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB 
shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:
    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which 
are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily 
expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using 
procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or 
treatment purposes.
    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated 
benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that 
may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, 
the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result 
from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies 
subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The 
IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying 
knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of 
the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall 
within the purview of its responsibility.
    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment 
the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the 
setting in which the research will be conducted and should be 
particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving 
vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, 
mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons.
    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or 
the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and 
to the extent required by Sec. 46.116.
    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance 
with, and to the extent required by Sec. 46.117.
    (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for

[[Page 117]]

monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
    (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the 
privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
    (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to 
coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, pregnant 
women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the 
study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.


<R05>
Sec. 46.112  Review by institution.

    Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may 
be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by 
officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve 
the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 46.113  Suspension or termination of IRB approval of research.

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of 
research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's 
requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to 
subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a 
statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported 
promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and 
the department or agency head.

Sec. 46.114  Cooperative research.

    Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this 
policy which involve more than one institution. In the conduct of 
cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying 
with this policy. With the approval of the department or agency head, an 
institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a 
joint review arrangement, rely upon the review of another qualified IRB, 
or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.


<R05>
Sec. 46.115  IRB records.

    (a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and 
maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the 
following:
    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific 
evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample 
consent documents, progress reports submitted by investigators, and 
reports of injuries to subjects.
    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings which shall be in sufficient detail to 
show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on 
these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and 
abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; 
and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their 
resolution.
    (3) Records of continuing review activities.
    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the 
investigators.
    (5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described is Sec. 
46.103(b)(3).
    (6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described 
in Sec. 46.103(b)(4) and Sec. 46.103(b)(5).
    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as 
required by Sec. 46.116(b)(5).
    (b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at 
least 3 years, and records relating to research which is conducted shall 
be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. All 
records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized 
representatives of the department or agency at reasonable times and in a 
reasonable manner.

Sec. 46.116  General requirements for informed consent.

    Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, no investigator may 
involve a human being as a subject in research covered by this policy 
unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed 
consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized 
representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under 
circumstances

[[Page 118]]

that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient 
opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize 
the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information that is 
given to the subject or the representative shall be in language 
understandable to the subject or the representative. No informed 
consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language 
through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or 
appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or 
appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or its 
agents from liability for negligence.
    (a) Basic elements of informed consent. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, in seeking informed consent the 
following information shall be provided to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of 
the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's 
participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and 
identification of any procedures which are experimental;
    (2) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts 
to the subject;
    (3) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which 
may reasonably be expected from the research;
    (4) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of 
treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject;
    (5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which 
confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;
    (6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as 
to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical 
treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist 
of, or where further information may be obtained;
    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent 
questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to 
contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject; and
    (8) A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to 
participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue 
participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which 
the subject is otherwise entitled.
    (b) Additional elements of informed consent. When appropriate, one 
or more of the following elements of information shall also be provided 
to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may 
involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject 
is or may become pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable;
    (2) Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's 
participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to 
the subject's consent;
    (3) Any additional costs to the subject that may result from 
participation in the research;
    (4) The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the 
research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the 
subject;
    (5) A statement that significant new findings developed during the 
course of the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to 
continue participation will be provided to the subject; and
    (6) The approximate number of subjects involved in the study.
    (c) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth above, or waive the requirement to obtain informed consent 
provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by or 
subject to the approval of state or local government officials and is 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine: (i) Public benefit of 
service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services 
under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those 
programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or levels of 
payment for benefits or services under those programs; and

[[Page 119]]

    (2) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration.
    (d) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth in this section, or waive the requirements to obtain informed 
consent provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;
    (2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights 
and welfare of the subjects;
    (3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration; and
    (4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation.
    (e) The informed consent requirements in this policy are not 
intended to preempt any applicable federal, state, or local laws which 
require additional information to be disclosed in order for informed 
consent to be legally effective.
    (f) Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the authority of a 
physician to provide emergency medical care, to the extent the physician 
is permitted to do so under applicable federal, state, or local law.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
9999-0020)


<R05>
Sec. 46.117  Documentation of informed consent.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed 
consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form 
approved by the IRB and signed by the subject or the subject's legally 
authorized representative. A copy shall be given to the person signing 
the form.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the consent 
form may be either of the following:
    (1) A written consent document that embodies the elements of 
informed consent required by Sec. 46.116. This form may be read to the 
subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but in any 
event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the 
representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed; or
    (2) A short form written consent document stating that the elements 
of informed consent required by Sec. 46.116 have been presented orally 
to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When 
this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. 
Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to 
the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be 
signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall 
sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person 
actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of 
the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in 
addition to a copy of the short form.
    (c) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain 
a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either:
    (1) That the only record linking the subject and the research would 
be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm 
resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked 
whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern; or
    (2) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.
    In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB 
may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written 
statement regarding the research.

<R05>
Sec. 46.118  Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement 
of human subjects.

    Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or 
contracts are submitted to departments or agencies with the knowledge 
that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite 
plans would not

[[Page 120]]

normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include 
activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific 
projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants 
in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and 
projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon 
completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of 
compounds. These applications need not be reviewed by an IRB before an 
award may be made. However, except for research exempted or waived under 
Sec. 46.101 (b) or (i), no human subjects may be involved in any project 
supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and 
approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification 
submitted, by the institution, to the department or agency.


<R05>
Sec. 46.119  Research undertaken without the intention of involving human 
subjects.

    In the event research is undertaken without the intention of 
involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human 
subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and 
approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification 
submitted, by the institution, to the department or agency, and final 
approval given to the proposed change by the department or agency.


<R05>
Sec. 46.120  Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for 
research to be conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency.

    (a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and 
proposals involving human subjects submitted to the department or agency 
through such officers and employees of the department or agency and such 
experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks 
to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the 
potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the 
importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.
    (b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into 
negotiations to develop an approvable one.


<R05>
Sec. 46.121  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 46.122  Use of Federal funds.

    Federal funds administered by a department or agency may not be 
expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements 
of this policy have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 46.123  Early termination of research support: Evaluation of 
applications and proposals.

    (a) The department or agency head may require that department or 
agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner 
prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or 
agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with 
the terms of this policy.
    (b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications 
or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may 
take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and 
program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject 
to a termination or suspension under paragarph (a) of this section and 
whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has 
have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has 
have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially 
failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and 
welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to 
federal regulation).


<R05>
Sec. 46.124  Conditions.

    With respect to any research project or any class of research 
projects the department or agency head may impose additional conditions 
prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the 
department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the 
protection of human subjects.

American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Governments.
    (d) The requirements of this subpart are in addition to those 
imposed under the other subparts of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 46.202  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 46.102 shall be applicable to this subpart 
as well. In addition, as used in this subpart:
    (a) Dead fetus means a fetus that exhibits neither heartbeat, 
spontaneous respiratory activity, spontaneous movement of voluntary 
muscles, nor pulsation of the umbilical cord.
    (b) Delivery means complete separation of the fetus from the woman 
by expulsion or extraction or any other means.
    (c) Fetus means the product of conception from implantation until 
delivery.
    (d) Neonate means a newborn.
    (e) Nonviable neonate means a neonate after delivery that, although 
living, is not viable.
    (f) Pregnancy encompasses the period of time from implantation until

any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human 
Services to whom authority has been delegated.
    (h) Viable, as it pertains to the neonate, means being able, after 
delivery, to survive (given the benefit of available medical therapy) to 
the point of independently maintaining heartbeat and respiration. The 
Secretary may from time to time, taking into account medical advances, 
publish in the Federal Register guidelines to assist in determining 
whether a neonate is viable for purposes of this subpart. If a neonate 
is viable then it may be included in research only to the extent 
permitted and in accordance with the requirements of subparts A and D of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 46.203  Duties of IRBs in connection with research involving pregnant 
women, fetuses, and neonates.

Sec. 46.204  Research involving pregnant women or fetuses.

    Pregnant women or fetuses may be involved in research if all of the 
following conditions are met:
    (a) Where scientifically appropriate, preclinical studies, including 
studies on pregnant animals, and clinical studies, including studies on 
nonpregnant women, have been conducted and provide data for assessing 
potential risks to pregnant women and fetuses;
    (b) The risk to the fetus is caused solely by interventions or 
procedures that hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the woman or 
the fetus; or, if there is no such prospect of benefit, the risk to the 
fetus is not greater than minimal and the purpose of the research is the 
development of important

[[Page 122]]

biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by any other means;
    (c) Any risk is the least possible for achieving the objectives of 
the research;
    (d) If the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the 
pregnant woman, the prospect of a direct benefit both to the pregnant 
woman and the fetus, or no prospect of benefit for the woman nor the 
fetus when risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal and the purpose 
of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge 
that cannot be obtained by any other means, her consent is obtained in 
accord with the informed consent provisions of subpart A of this part;
    (e) If the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit solely 
to the fetus then the consent of the pregnant woman and the father is 
obtained in accord with the informed consent provisions of subpart A of 
this part, except that the father's consent need not be obtained if he 
is unable to consent because of unavailability, incompetence, or 
temporary incapacity or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
    (f) Each individual providing consent under paragraph (d) or (e) of 
this section is fully informed regarding the reasonably foreseeable 
impact of the research on the fetus or neonate;
    (g) For children as defined in Sec. 46.402(a) who are pregnant, 
assent and permission are obtained in accord with the provisions of 
subpart D of this part;
    (h) No inducements, monetary or otherwise, will be offered to 
terminate a pregnancy;
    (i) Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in any 
decisions as to the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate a 
pregnancy; and
    (j) Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in 
determining the viability of a neonate.


<R05>
Sec. 46.205  Research involving neonates.

    (a) Neonates of uncertain viability and nonviable neonates may be 
involved in research if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) Where scientifically appropriate, preclinical and clinical 
studies have been conducted and provide data for assessing potential 
risks to neonates.
    (2) Each individual providing consent under paragraph (b)(2) or 
(c)(5) of this section is fully informed regarding the reasonably 
foreseeable impact of the research on the neonate.
    (3) Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in 
determining the viability of a neonate.
    (4) The requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section have 
been met as applicable.
    (b) Neonates of uncertain viability. Until it has been ascertained 
whether or not a neonate is viable, a neonate may not be involved in 
research covered by this subpart unless the following additional 
conditions are met:
    (1) The IRB determines that:
    (i) The research holds out the prospect of enhancing the probability 
of survival of the neonate to the point of viability, and any risk is 
the least possible for achieving that objective, or
    (ii) The purpose of the research is the development of important 
biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by other means and there 
will be no added risk to the neonate resulting from the research; and
    (2) The legally effective informed consent of either parent of the 
neonate or, if neither parent is able to consent because of 
unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity, the legally 
effective informed consent of either parent's legally authorized 
representative is obtained in accord with subpart A of this part, except 
that the consent of the father or his legally authorized representative 
need not be obtained if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
    (c) Nonviable neonates. After delivery nonviable neonate may not be 
involved in research covered by this subpart unless all of the following 
additional conditions are met:
    (1) Vital functions of the neonate will not be artificially 
maintained;
    (2) The research will not terminate the heartbeat or respiration of 
the neonate;
    (3) There will be no added risk to the neonate resulting from the 
research;
    (4) The purpose of the research is the development of important 
biomedical

[[Page 123]]

knowledge that cannot be obtained by other means; and
    (5) The legally effective informed consent of both parents of the 
neonate is obtained in accord with subpart A of this part, except that 
the waiver and alteration provisions of Sec. 46.116(c) and (d) do not 
apply. However, if either parent is unable to consent because of 
unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity, the informed 
consent of one parent of a nonviable neonate will suffice to meet the 
requirements of this paragraph (c)(5), except that the consent of the 
father need not be obtained if the pregnancy resulted from rape or 
incest. The consent of a legally authorized representative of either or 
both of the parents of a nonviable neonate will not suffice to meet the 
requirements of this paragraph (c)(5).
    (d) Viable neonates. A neonate, after delivery, that has been 
determined to be viable may be included in research only to the extent 
permitted by and in accord with the requirements of subparts A and D of 
this part.

Sec. 46.207  Research not otherwise approvable which presents an opportunity 
to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health 
or 
          welfare of pregnant women, fetuses, or neonates.

    The Secretary will conduct or fund research that the IRB does not 
believe meets the requirements of Sec. 46.204 or Sec. 46.205 only if:
    (a) The IRB finds that the research presents a reasonable 
opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation of 
a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of pregnant women, 
fetuses or neonates; and
    (b) The Secretary, after consultation with a panel of experts in 
pertinent disciplines (for example: science, medicine, ethics, law) and 
following opportunity for public review and comment, including a public 
meeting announced in the Federal Register, has determined either:
    (1) That the research in fact satisfies the conditions of Sec. 
46.204, as applicable; or
    (2) The following:
    (i) The research presents a reasonable opportunity to further the 
understanding, prevention, or alleviation of a serious problem affecting

or incarceration in a penal institution, and individuals detained 
pending arraignment, trial, or sentencing.
    (d) Minimal risk is the probability and magnitude of physical or 
psychological harm that is normally encountered in the daily lives, or 
in the routine medical, dental, or psychological examination of healthy 
persons.

Sec. 46.304  Composition of Institutional Review Boards where prisoners are 
involved.

    In addition to satisfying the requirements in Sec. 46.107 of this 
part, an Institutional Review Board, carrying out responsibilities under 
this part with respect to research covered by this subpart, shall also 
meet the following specific requirements:
    (a) A majority of the Board (exclusive of prisoner members) shall 
have no association with the prison(s) involved, apart from their 
membership on the Board.
    (b) At least one member of the Board shall be a prisoner, or a 
prisoner representative with appropriate background and experience to 
serve in that capacity, except that where a particular research project 
is reviewed by more than one Board only one Board need satisfy this 
requirement.

<R05>
Sec. 46.305  Additional duties of the Institutional Review Boards where 
prisoners are involved.

    (a) In addition to all other responsibilities prescribed for 
Institutional Review Boards under this part, the Board shall review 
research covered by this subpart and approve such research only if it 
finds that:
    (1) The research under review represents one of the categories of 
research permissible under Sec. 46.306(a)(2);
    (2) Any possible advantages accruing to the prisoner through his or 
her participation in the research, when compared to the general living 
conditions, medical care, quality of food, amenities and opportunity for 
earnings in the prison, are not of such a magnitude that his or her 
ability to weigh the risks of the research against the value of such 
advantages in the limited choice environment of the prison is impaired;
    (3) The risks involved in the research are commensurate with risks 
that would be accepted by nonprisoner volunteers;
    (4) Procedures for the selection of subjects within the prison are 
fair to all prisoners and immune from arbitrary intervention by prison 
authorities or prisoners. Unless the principal investigator provides to 
the Board justification in writing for following some other procedures, 
control subjects must be selected randomly from the group of available 
prisoners who meet the characteristics needed for that particular 
research project;
    (5) The information is presented in language which is understandable 
to the subject population;
    (6) Adequate assurance exists that parole boards will not take into 
account a prisoner's participation in the research in making decisions 
regarding parole, and each prisoner is clearly informed in advance that 
participation in the research will have no effect on his or her parole; 
and

[[Page 125]]

    (7) Where the Board finds there may be a need for follow-up 
examination or care of participants after the end of their 
participation, adequate provision has been made for such examination or 
care, taking into account the varying lengths of individual prisoners' 
sentences, and for informing participants of this fact.
    (b) The Board shall carry out such other duties as may be assigned 
by the Secretary.
    (c) The institution shall certify to the Secretary, in such form and 
manner as the Secretary may require, that the duties of the Board under 
this section have been fulfilled.


<R05>
Sec. 46.306  Permitted research involving prisoners.

    (a) Biomedical or behavioral research conducted or supported by DHHS 
may involve prisoners as subjects only if:
    (1) The institution responsible for the conduct of the research has 
certified to the Secretary that the Institutional Review Board has 
approved the research under Sec. 46.305 of this subpart; and
    (2) In the judgment of the Secretary the proposed research involves 
solely the following:
    (i) Study of the possible causes, effects, and processes of 
incarceration, and of criminal behavior, provided that the study 
presents no more than minimal risk and no more than inconvenience to the 
subjects;
    (ii) Study of prisons as institutional structures or of prisoners as 
incarcerated persons, provided that the study presents no more than 
minimal risk and no more than inconvenience to the subjects;
    (iii) Research on conditions particularly affecting prisoners as a 
class (for example, vaccine trials and other research on hepatitis which 
is much more prevalent in prisons than elsewhere; and research on social 
and psychological problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction and sexual 
assaults) provided that the study may proceed only after the Secretary 
has consulted with appropriate experts including experts in penology 
medicine and ethics, and published notice, in the Federal Register, of 
his intent to approve such research; or
    (iv) Research on practices, both innovative and accepted, which have 
the intent and reasonable probability of improving the health or well-
being of the subject. In cases in which those studies require the 
assignment of prisoners in a manner consistent with protocols approved 
by the IRB to control groups which may not benefit from the research, 
the study may proceed only after the Secretary has consulted with 
appropriate experts, including experts in penology medicine and ethics, 
and published notice, in the Federal Register, of his intent to approve 
such research.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, biomedical 
or behavioral research conducted or supported by DHHS shall not involve 
prisoners as subjects.

<R05>
Sec. 46.401  To what do these regulations apply?

    (a) This subpart applies to all research involving children as 
subjects, conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human 
Services.
    (1) This includes research conducted by Department employees, except 
that each head of an Operating Division of the Department may adopt such 
nonsubstantive, procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an 
administrative standpoint.
    (2) It also includes research conducted or supported by the 
Department of Health and Human Services outside the United States, but 
in appropriate circumstances, the Secretary may, under paragraph (e) of 
Sec. 46.101 of Subpart A, waive the applicability of some or all of the 
requirements of these regulations for research of this type.
    (b) Exemptions at Sec. 46.101(b)(1) and (b)(3) through (b)(6) are 
applicable to this subpart. The exemption at Sec. 46.101(b)(2) regarding 
educational tests is also applicable to this subpart. However, the 
exemption at Sec. 46.101(b)(2) for research involving survey or 
interview

[[Page 126]]

procedures or observations of public behavior does not apply to research 
covered by this subpart, except for research involving observation of 
public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the 
activities being observed.
    (c) The exceptions, additions, and provisions for waiver as they 
appear in paragraphs (c) through (i) of Sec. 46.101 of Subpart A are 
applicable to this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 46.402  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 46.102 of Subpart A shall be applicable to 
this subpart as well. In addition, as used in this subpart:
    (a) Children are persons who have not attained the legal age for 
consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the 
applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be 
conducted.
    (b) Assent means a child's affirmative agreement to participate in 
research. Mere failure to object should not, absent affirmative 
agreement, be construed as assent.
    (c) Permission means the agreement of parent(s) or guardian to the 
participation of their child or ward in research.
    (d) Parent means a child's biological or adoptive parent.
    (e) Guardian means an individual who is authorized under applicable 
State or local law to consent on behalf of a child to general medical 
care.


<R05>
Sec. 46.403  IRB duties.

    In addition to other responsibilities assigned to IRBs under this 
part, each IRB shall review research covered by this subpart and approve 
only research which satisfies the conditions of all applicable sections 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 46.404  Research not involving greater than minimal risk.

    HHS will conduct or fund research in which the IRB finds that no 
greater than minimal risk to children is presented, only if the IRB 
finds that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the 
children and the permission of their parents or guardians, as set forth 
in Sec. 46.408.


<R05>
Sec. 46.405  Research involving greater than minimal risk but presenting 
the prospect of direct benefit to the individual subjects.

    HHS will conduct or fund research in which the IRB finds that more 
than minimal risk to children is presented by an intervention or 
procedure that holds out the prospect of direct benefit for the 
individual subject, or by a monitoring procedure that is likely to 
contribute to the subject's well-being, only if the IRB finds that:
    (a) The risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the 
subjects;
    (b) The relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least 
as favorable to the subjects as that presented by available alternative 
approaches; and
    (c) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the 
children and permission of their parents or guardians, as set forth in 
Sec. 46.408.


<R05>
Sec. 46.406  Research involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of 
direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge 
          about the subject's disorder or condition.

    HHS will conduct or fund research in which the IRB finds that more 
than minimal risk to children is presented by an intervention or 
procedure that does not hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the 
individual subject, or by a monitoring procedure which is not likely to 
contribute to the well-being of the subject, only if the IRB finds that:
    (a) The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk;
    (b) The intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects 
that are reasonably commensurate with those inherent in their actual or 
expected medical, dental, psychological, social, or educational 
situations;
    (c) The intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable 
knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition which is of vital 
importance for the understanding or amelioration of the subjects' 
disorder or condition; and
    (d) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting assent of the 
children and permission of their parents or guardians, as set forth in 
Sec. 46.408.

[[Page 127]]


<R05>
Sec. 46.407  Research not otherwise approvable which presents an opportunity 
to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health or 
          welfare of children.

    HHS will conduct or fund research that the IRB does not believe 
meets the requirements of Sec. 46.404, Sec. 46.405, or Sec. 46.406 only 
if:
    (a) The IRB finds that the research presents a reasonable 
opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation of 
a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children; and
    (b) The Secretary, after consultation with a panel of experts in 
pertinent disciplines (for example: science, medicine, education, 
ethics, law) and following opportunity for public review and comment, 
has determined either:
    (1) That the research in fact satisfies the conditions of Sec. 
46.404, Sec. 46.405, or Sec. 46.406, as applicable, or
    (2) The following:
    (i) The research presents a reasonable opportunity to further the 
understanding, prevention, or alleviation of a serious problem affecting 
the health or welfare of children;
    (ii) The research will be conducted in accordance with sound ethical 
principles;
    (iii) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of 
children and the permission of their parents or guardians, as set forth 
in Sec. 46.408.


<R05>
Sec. 46.408  Requirements for permission by parents or guardians and for 
assent by children.

    (a) In addition to the determinations required under other 
applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine that 
adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children, 
when in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing 
assent. In determining whether children are capable of assenting, the 
IRB shall take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state 
of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to 
be involved in research under a particular protocol, or for each child, 
as the IRB deems appropriate. If the IRB determines that the capability 
of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably 
be consulted or that the intervention or procedure involved in the 
research holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the 
health or well-being of the children and is available only in the 
context of the research, the assent of the children is not a necessary 
condition for proceeding with the research. Even where the IRB 
determines that the subjects are capable of assenting, the IRB may still 
waive the assent requirement under circumstances in which consent may be 
waived in accord with Sec. 46.116 of Subpart A.
    (b) In addition to the determinations required under other 
applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine, in 
accordance with and to the extent that consent is required by Sec. 
46.116 of Subpart A, that adequate provisions are made for soliciting 
the permission of each child's parents or guardian. Where parental 
permission is to be obtained, the IRB may find that the permission of 
one parent is sufficient for research to be conducted under Sec. 46.404 
or Sec. 46.405. Where research is covered by Sec.Sec. 46.406 and 46.407 
and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents must give 
their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or 
not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal 
responsibility for the care and custody of the child.
    (c) In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in Sec. 
46.116 of Subpart A, if the IRB determines that a research protocol is 
designed for conditions or for a subject population for which parental 
or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the 
subjects (for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the 
consent requirements in Subpart A of this part and paragraph (b) of this 
section, provided an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children 
who will participate as subjects in the research is substituted, and 
provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, state 
or local law. The choice of an appropriate mechanism would depend upon 
the nature and purpose of the activities described in the protocol, the 
risk and anticipated benefit to the research subjects,

[[Page 128]]

and their age, maturity, status, and condition.
    (d) Permission by parents or guardians shall be documented in 
accordance with and to the extent required by Sec. 46.117 of Subpart A.
    (e) When the IRB determines that assent is required, it shall also 
determine whether and how assent must be documented.


<R05>
Sec. 46.409  Wards.

    (a) Children who are wards of the state or any other agency, 
institution, or entity can be included in research approved under Sec. 
46.406 or Sec. 46.407 only if such research is:
    (1) Related to their status as wards; or
    (2) Conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar 
settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not 
wards.
    (b) If the research is approved under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the IRB shall require appointment of an advocate for each child who is a 
ward, in addition to any other individual acting on behalf of the child 
as guardian or in loco parentis. One individual may serve as advocate 
for more than one child. The advocate shall be an individual who has the 
background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best 
interests of the child for the duration of the child's participation in 
the research and who is not associated in any way (except in the role as 
advocate or member of the IRB) with the research, the investigator(s), 
or the guardian organization.

Sec. 50.1  Authority.

    Under the authority of Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act 
of 1961 (75 Stat. 527) and the Immigration and Nationality Act as 
amended (84 Stat. 116), the Department of Health and Human Services is 
an ``interested United States Government agency'' with the authority to 
request the Department of State to recommend to the Attorney General 
waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement for Exchange 
Visitors under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Program. HHS 
eligibility requirement criteria for waivers are in addition to and 
independent of the existing waiver and visa criteria established by the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Department of State, 
and the Department of Labor. The waiver regulations described in this 
part do not relieve alien physicians seeking a waiver of the 2-year 
foreign residence requirement from complying with the terms and 
conditions imposed on their admission to the United States.

[67 FR 77695, Dec. 19, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 50.2  Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board.

    (a) Establishment. The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board is 
established to carry out the Department's responsibilities under the 
Exchange Visitor Program.
    (b) Functions. The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board is 
responsible for making thorough and equitable evaluations of 
applications submitted by institutions, acting on behalf of Exchange 
Visitors, to HHS for a favorable recommendation to the Department of 
State that the two-year foreign residence requirement for Exchange 
Visitors under the Exchange Visitor Program be waived.
    (c) Membership. The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board consists of 
no fewer than three members and two alternates, of whom no fewer than 
three

[[Page 129]]

will consider any particular application. The Director of the Office of 
Global Health Affairs, Office of the Secretary, is an ex officio member 
of the Board and serves as its Chairman. The Director may designate a 
staff member of the Office of the Secretary to serve as member and 
Chairman of the Board in the Director's absence. The Assistant Secretary 
for Health appoints two regularly assigned members and two alternates to 
consider applications concerning health, biomedical research, and 
related fields. The Chairman may request the heads of operating 
divisions of the Department to appoint additional members to consider 
applications in other fields of interest to the Department. The Board 
may obtain expert advisory opinions from other sources. The Board may 
establish a workgroup from the operating divisions of the Department to 
consider applications for waivers based on the need for the delivery of 
health care services to underserved populations.

[49 FR 9900, Mar. 16, 1984, as amended at 67 FR 77695, Dec. 19, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 50.3  Policy.

    (a) Policy for waivers. The Department of Health and Human Services 
endorses the philosophy that Exchange Visitors are committed to return 
home for at least two years after completing their program. This 
requirement was imposed to prevent the Program from becoming a stepping 
stone to immigration and to ensure that Exchange Visitors make available 
to their home countries their new knowledge and skills obtained in the 
United States. The Department will request waivers for the delivery of 
health care service to carry out the Department's mission to increase 
access to care for the nation's most medically underserved individuals. 
However, in keeping with the philosophy of the Program, the Exchange 
Visitor Waiver Review Board may determine the appropriate numbers and 
geographic areas for waivers for the delivery of health care service.
    (b) Criteria for waivers. The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board 
carefully applies stringent and restrictive criteria to its 
consideration of requests that it support waivers for Exchange Visitors. 
Each application is evaluated individually based on the facts available.
    (c) Waiver for members of Exchange Visitor's family. Where a 
decision is made to request a waiver for an Exchange Visitor, a waiver 
will also be requested for the spouse and children, if any, if they have 
J-2 visa status. When both members of a married couple are Exchange 
Visitors in their own right (i.e., each has J-1 visa status), separate 
applications must be submitted for each of them.

[67 FR 77696, Dec. 19, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 50.4  Waivers for research.

    In determining whether to request a waiver for an Exchange Visitor 
engaged in the conduct of research, the Board considers the following 
key factors:
    (a) The program or activity at the applicant institution or 
organization in which the Exchange Visitor is employed must be of high 
priority and of national or international significance in an area of 
interest to the Department.
    (b) The Exchange Visitor must be needed as an integral part of the 
program or activity, or of an essential component thereof, so that loss 
of his/her services would necessitate discontinuance of the program, or 
a major phase of it. Specific evidence must be provided on how the loss 
or unavailability of the individual's services would adversely affect 
the initiation, continuance, completion, or success of the program or 
activity. The applicant organization/institution must clearly 
demonstrate that a suitable replacement for the Exchange Visitor cannot 
be found through recruitment or any other means. The Board will not 
request a waiver when the principal problem appears to be one of 
administrative, budgetary, or program inconvenience to the institution 
or other employer.
    (c) The Exchange Visitor must possess outstanding qualifications, 
training and experience well beyond the usually expected accomplishments 
at the graduate, postgraduate, and residency levels, and must clearly 
demonstrate the capability to make original and significant 
contributions to the program. The Board will not request a

[[Page 130]]

waiver simply because an individual has specialized training or 
experience or is occupying a senior staff position in a university, 
hospital, or other institution.

[67 FR 77696, Dec. 19, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 50.5  Waivers for the delivery of health care service.

    In determining whether to request a waiver for an Exchange Visitor 
to deliver health care service, the Board will consider information from 
and coordinate with State Departments of Public Health (or the 
equivalent), other ``interested government agencies'' which request 
waivers, and other relevant agencies. The Board requires the following 
criteria for requests for waivers for the delivery of health care 
service:
    (a) The Exchange Visitor must submit a statement that he or she does 
not have pending and will not submit any other ``interested government 
agency'' waiver request while HHS processes the waiver request being 
submitted.
    (b) Waivers are limited to primary care physicians and general 
psychiatrists who have completed their primary care or psychiatric 
residency training programs no more than12 months before the date of 
commencement of employment under the contract described in subparagraph 
(d). This 12-month eligibility limitation is to ensure that the 
physicians' primary care training is current and they are not engaged in 
subspecialty training. This HHS eligibility requirement relates only to 
eligibility for an HHS waiver request and does not relieve physicians of 
the responsibility to maintain lawful status. Alien physicians are 
strongly encouraged to begin the waiver process as early as they 
possibly can while still in the residency training program. Early filing 
of the waiver request by the alien physician, coupled with timely 
processing of the request by the relevant government agencies, will 
facilitate the timely completion of the waiver process before the 
authorized J-1 admission expires, and the physician's subsequent 
application for change of nonimmigrant status from J-1 to H-1B.
    (c) Primary care physicians are defined as: physicians practicing 
general internal medicine, pediatrics, family practice or obstetrics/
gynecology willing to work in a primary care Health Professional 
Shortage Area (HPSA) or Medically Underserved Area or Population (MUA/
P); and general psychiatrists who are willing to work in a Mental Health 
HPSA. Note: these HHS eligibility criteria for waivers are in addition 
to and independent of the existing waiver and visa criteria established 
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Department of 
State, and the Department of Labor.
    (d) The Exchange Visitor must have entered a contract with the 
applicant employer. This contract must:
    (1) Require the Exchange Visitor to provide primary medical care in 
a facility physically located in an HHS-designated primary care HPSA or 
MUA/P, or general psychiatric care in a Mental Health HPSA.
    (2) Require the Exchange Visitor to complete a term of employment of 
not less than three years providing primary care health services for not 
less than 40 hours per week.
    (3) Require the Exchange Visitor to:
    (i) Be licensed by the State where he or she will practice;
    (ii) Have completed a residency in one of the following specialties: 
family practice, general pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, general 
internal medicine, or general psychiatry; and
    (iii) Be either board certified or board eligible in the relevant 
primary care discipline.
    (4) Be terminable only for cause until completion of the three-year 
commitment, except that, with the agreement of the alien physician, the 
employer may assign the contract to another eligible employer with the 
prior approval of HHS and compliance with all applicable INS and 
Department of Labor requirements. Prior to approving an assignment of 
the contract, HHS will review and consider the health care needs of the 
alien physician's current and proposed new locations, as well as the 
reasons for the request.
    (5) Not contain a restrictive covenant or non-compete clause which 
prevents

[[Page 131]]

or discourages the physician from continuing to practice in any HHS-
designated primary care HPSA or MUA/P or Mental Health HPSA after the 
period of obligation under the contract has expired.
    (6) Provide that any amendment to the contract complies with all 
applicable Federal statutes, regulations and HHS policy.
    (7) Be consistent with all applicable Federal statutes, regulations 
and HHS policy.
    (e) The facility or practice sponsoring the physician:
    (1) Must provide health services to individuals without 
discriminating against them because either they are unable to pay for 
those services or payment for those health services will be made under 
Medicare or Medicaid.
    (2) May charge no more than the usual and customary rate prevailing 
in the geographic area in which the services are provided.
    (3) Must provide care on a sliding fee scale for persons at or below 
200 percent of poverty income level. Persons with third-party insurance 
may be charged the full fee for service.
    (4) Must post a notice in a conspicuous location in the patient 
waiting area at the practice site to notify patients of the charges for 
service as required in this paragraph.
    (5) Must provide evidence that the applicant facility made 
unsuccessful efforts to recruit a physician who is a United States 
physician for the position to be filled by the Exchange Visitor.
    (6) Must provide a statement by the head of the facility to confirm 
the facility is located in a specific, designated HPSA or MUA/P, and 
that it provides medical care to Medicaid and Medicare eligible patients 
and to the uninsured indigent.
    (f) The employer and the alien physician must submit information to 
the Secretary at the times and in the manner that the Secretary may 
reasonably require.

[67 FR 77696, Dec. 19, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 50.6  Procedures for Submission of application to HHS.

    (a) The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board will review 
applications submitted by private or non-federal institutions, 
organizations, or agencies or by a component agency of HHS. The Board 
will not accept applications submitted by Exchange Visitors or, unless 
under extenuating and exceptional circumstances, other U.S. Government 
Agencies.
    (b) Applications, instruction sheets and information are available 
from the Executive Secretary, Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board. An 
authorized official of the applicant institution (educational 
institution, hospital, laboratory, corporation, etc.) must sign the 
completed application. The applicant institution must send the completed 
application to the address indicated on the instruction sheet.

[67 FR 77697, Dec. 19, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 50.7  Personal hardship, persecution and visa extension considerations.

    (a) It is not within the Department's jurisdiction to consider 
applications for waiver based on:
    (1) Exceptional hardship to the exchange visitor's American or 
legally resident alien spouse or child; or
    (2) The alien's unwillingness to return to the country of his/her 
nationality or last residence on the grounds that he/she or family 
members would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion or 
political opinion.
    (b) Likewise, this Department is not responsible for considering 
requests to extend visas.

Sec. 50.8  Compliance.

    If an alien physician acquires H-1B nonimmigrant status following 
approval by the INS of a request for waiver, then he or she becomes 
subject not only to the terms and conditions of the waiver, but also the 
terms and conditions of the H-1B nonimmigrant status. Failure to comply 
with those conditions will make that physician subject

to removal from the United States by the INS.

Sec.
51.1 Purpose.
51.2 Application.
51.3 Who is eligible to apply?
51.4 How will the plans be evaluated?

    Authority: Sec. 212, Immigration and Nationality Act, Pub. L. 82-
114, as amended by Pub. L. 97-116, 95 Stat. 1611 (8 U.S.C. 
1182(j)(2)(A)).

    Source: 48 FR 2539, Jan. 20, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to establish criteria for review 
and evaluation of the comprehensive plans of Graduate Medical Education 
Programs to reduce reliance on alien physicians, as required by the 
Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1981, Pub. L. 97-116, for 
the waiver of certain requirements for exchange visitors who are coming 
to the United States to participate in programs of graduate medical 
education or training.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2  Application.

    Materials covering procedures for applying for substantial 
disruption waivers (including the comprehensive plan) may be obtained 
from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, 3624 
Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.

    Explanatory Note: The Department of State entered into an agreement 
with the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in 1971 
whereby the latter was designated the authority to administer the 
issuance of the Form IAP-66 in all cases involving the admission, 
certification, transfer or extension of stay for foreign physicians in 
exchange visitor status who are receiving graduate medical education or 
training. The Commission was further designated the authority (Federal 
Register, Volume 44, No. 59, March 26, 1979), to process waiver requests 
under the ``substantial disruption'' provision of Pub. L. 94-484, as 
amended, within criteria to be provided by the United States Information 
Agency on advice from the Department of Health and Human Services 
(formerly Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).


<R05>
Sec. 51.3  Who is eligible to apply?

    Sponsors which had alien physicians in their exchange visitor 
programs on January 10, 1978, are eligible to apply. For purposes of 
this regulation, the term ``program'' relates to a graduate medical 
education program having an exchange visitor program for physicians 
participating in graduate medical education or training. An ``exchange 
visitor program'' is a program of a sponsor, designed to promote 
interchange of persons, knowledge and skills, and the interchange of 
developments in the field of education, the arts and sciences, and is 
concerned with one or more categories of participants to promote mutual 
understanding between the people of the United States and the people of 
other countries.


<R05>
Sec. 51.4  How will the plans be evaluated?

    After consultation with the Federal Substantial Disruption Waiver 
Board (seven Federal representatives charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing substantial disruption waiver applications), the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services will make recommendations to the Director, 
United States Information Agency, for the purpose of granting waivers. 
The Secretary will consider the following factors in determining whether 
or not a plan is satisfactory:
    (a) The extent of the specific problems that the program or 
institution anticipates without a waiver, including, for example,
    (1) Curtailment of services currently provided,
    (2) Downgrading of medical care currently being provided,
    (3) Reduction in the number of inpatients and outpatients receiving 
care,
    (4) Inadequate medical coverage for population served, or
    (5) Inadequate supervision of junior residents.
    (b) The adequacy of the alternative resources and methods (including 
use of physician assistants (as defined in 42 CFR 57.802), nurse 
practitioners (as defined in 42 CFR 57.2402), and other non-physician 
providers) that have been

[[Page 133]]

considered and have been and will be applied to reduce such disruption 
in the delivery of health services, especially in primary medical care 
manpower shortage areas, as established under section 332 of the Public 
Health Service Act, and for medicaid patients. This may include, for 
example:
    (1) Greater reliance on fully licensed physicians, and on physician 
assistants, nurse practitioners and other non-physician personnel in an 
expanded role in the delivery of health care, such as admission patient 
histories, making patient rounds, recording patient progress notes, 
doing the initial and follow-up evaluation of patients, performing 
routine laboratory and related studies, or
    (2) Utilization of the team approach to health care delivery 
(individuals functioning as an integral part of an interprofessional 
team of health personnel organized under the leadership of a physician 
working toward more efficient and/or more effective delivery of health 
services).
    (c) The extent to which changes (including improvement of 
educational and medical services) have been considered and which have 
been or will be applied to make the program more attractive to graduates 
of medical schools who are citizens of the United States, as 
demonstrated, for example, by:
    (1) Adding additional services to the existing programs to provide a 
broader educational experience for residents,
    (2) Expanding affiliations with other residency programs to offer a 
broader experience for residents,
    (3) Expanding undergraduate clerkships to provide a broader 
educational experience.
    (4) Creating or modifying administrative units which will provide 
broader clinical experiences, or
    (5) Initiating research projects.
    (d) The adequacy of the recruitment efforts which have been and will 
be undertaken to attract graduates of medical schools who are citizens 
of the United States, as demonstrated, for example, by:
    (1) Broad-based advertisement of the program and of the institution 
through notices in journals, contacts with medical schools, etc.
    (2) Forming committees for the purpose of recruiting U.S. citizens.
    (3) Working with national organizations which are involved with 
medical students and U.S. graduate medical trainees, e.g., the American 
Medical Student Association and the Physician National House Staff 
Association, to attract U.S. citizens.
    (e) The extent to which the program on a year-by-year basis has 
phased down its dependence upon aliens who are graduates of foreign 
medical schools so that the program will not be dependent upon the 
admission to the program of any additional such aliens after December 
31, 1983.

[[Page 139]]

    (2) Voluntary reporting on other health care practitioners. A health 
care entity may report to the Board of Medical Examiners information as 
described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section concerning actions 
described in paragraph (a)(1) in this section with respect to other 
health care practitioners.
    (3) What information must be reported. The health care entity must 
report the following information concerning actions described in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the physician or 
dentist:
    (i) Name,
    (ii) Work address,
    (iii) Home address, if known,
    (iv) Social Security number, if known, and if obtained in accordance 
with section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974,
    (v) Date of birth,
    (vi) Name of each professional school attended and year of 
graduation,
    (vii) For each professional license: the license number, the field 
of licensure, and the name of the State or Territory in which the 
license is held,
    (viii) Drug Enforcement Administration registration number, if 
known,
    (ix) A description of the acts or omissions or other reasons for 
privilege loss, or, if known, for surrender,
    (x) Action taken, date the action was taken, and effective date of 
the action, and
    (xi) Other information as required by the Secretary from time to 
time after publication in the Federal Register and after an opportunity 
for public comment.
    (b) Reporting by the Board of Medical Examiners to the National 
Practitioner Data Bank. Each Board must report, in accordance with 
Sec.Sec. 60.4 and 60.5, the information reported to it by a health care 
entity and any known instances of a health care entity's failure to 
report information as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
In addition, each Board must simultaneously report this information to 
the appropriate State licensing board in the State in which the health 
care entity is located, if the Board is not such licensing board.
    (c) Sanctions--(1) Health care entities. If the Secretary has reason 
to believe that a health care entity has substantially failed to report 
information in accordance with Sec. 60.9, the Secretary will conduct an 
investigation. If the investigation shows that the health care entity 
has not complied with Sec. 60.9, the Secretary will provide the entity 
with a written notice describing the noncompliance, giving the health 
care entity an opportunity to correct the noncompliance, and stating 
that the entity may request, within 30 days after receipt of such 
notice, a hearing with respect to the noncompliance. The request for a 
hearing must contain a statement of the material factual issues in 
dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues 
must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the 
Washington, DC, metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:
    (i) The request for a hearing is untimely,
    (ii) The health care entity does not provide a statement of material 
factual issues in dispute, or
    (iii) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or 
inconsequential.

In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will 
send a written denial to the health care entity setting forth the 
reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the 
hearing the entity is found to be in noncompliance, the Secretary will 
publish the name of the health care entity in the Federal Register. In 
such case, the immunity protections provided under section 411(a) of the 
Act will not apply to the health care entity for professional review 
activities that occur during the 3-year period beginning 30 days after 
the date of publication of the entity's name in the Federal Register.
    (2) Board of Medical Examiners. If, after notice of noncompliance 
and providing opportunity to correct noncompliance, the Secretary 
determines that a Board has failed to report information in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will

[[Page 140]]

designate another qualified entity for the reporting of this 
information.

    (a) When information must be requested. Each hospital, either 
directly or through an authorized agent, must request information from 
the Data Bank concerning a physician, dentist or other health care 
practitioner as follows:
    (1) At the time a physician, dentist or other health care 
practitioner applies for a position on its medical staff (courtesy or 
otherwise), or for clinical privileges at the hospital; and
    (2) Every 2 years concerning any physician, dentist, or other health 
care practitioner who is on its medical staff (courtesy or otherwise), 
or has clinical privileges at the hospital.

presumed to have knowledge of any information reported to the Data Bank 
concerning this physician, dentist or other health care practitioner.
    (c) Reliance on the obtained information. Each hospital may rely 
upon the information provided by the Data Bank to the hospital. A 
hospital shall not be held liable for this reliance unless the hospital

disclosure and of providing such information. The actual fees will be 
announced by the Secretary in periodic notices in the Federal Register.
    (b) Criteria for determining the fee. The amount of each fee will be 
determined based on the following criteria:
    (1) Use of electronic data processing equipment to obtain 
information--the actual cost for the service, including computer search 
time, runs, printouts, and time of computer programmers and operators, 
or other employees,
    (2) Photocopying or other forms of reproduction, such as magnetic 
tapes--actual cost of the operator's time, plus the cost of the machine 
time and the materials used,
    (3) Postage--actual cost, and
    (4) Sending information by special methods requested by the 
applicant, such as express mail or electronic transfer--the actual cost 
of the special service.
    (c) Assessing and collecting fees. The Secretary will announce

payment of Data Bank fees. In determining these methods, the Secretary 
will consider efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience for the Data 
Bank users and the Department. Methods may include: credit card; 
electronic fund transfer; check; and money order.

<R05>
Sec. 60.13  Confidentiality of National Practitioner Data Bank information.

    (a) Limitations on disclosure. Information reported to the Data Bank 
is considered confidential and shall not be disclosed outside the 
Department of Health and Human Services, except as specified in Sec. 
60.10, Sec. 60.11 and Sec. 60.14. Persons and entities which receive 
information from the Data Bank either directly or from another party 
must use it solely with respect to the purpose for which it was 
provided. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the disclosure of 
information by a party which is authorized under applicable State law to 
make such disclosure.
    (b) Penalty for violations. Any person who violates paragraph (a) 
shall be subject to a civil money penalty of up to $10,000 for each 
violation. This penalty will be imposed pursuant to procedures at 42 CFR 
part 1003.


<R05>
Sec. 60.14  How to dispute the accuracy of National Practitioner Data Bank 
information.

    (a) Who may dispute National Practitioner Data Bank information. Any 
physician, dentist or other health care practitioner may dispute the 
accuracy of information in the Data Bank concerning himself or herself. 
The Secretary will routinely mail a copy of any report filed in the Data 
Bank to the subject individual.
    (b) Procedures for filing a dispute. A physician, dentist or other 
health care practitioner has 60 days from the date on which the 
Secretary mails the report in question to him or her in which to dispute 
the accuracy of the report. The procedures for disputing a report are:
    (1) Informing the Secretary and the reporting entity, in writing, of 
the disagreement, and the basis for it,
    (2) Requesting simultaneously that the disputed information be 
entered into a ``disputed'' status and be reported to inquirers as being 
in a ``disputed'' status, and
    (3) Attempting to enter into discussion with the reporting entity to 
resolve the dispute.
    (c) Procedures for revising disputed information. (1) If the 
reporting entity revises the information originally submitted to the 
Data Bank, the Secretary will notify all entities to whom reports have 
been sent that the original information has been revised.
    (2) If the reporting entity does not revise the reported 
information, the Secretary will, upon request, review the written 
information submitted by both parties (the physician, dentist or other

[[Page 142]]

health care practitioner), and the reporting entity. After review, the 
Secretary will either--
    (i) If the Secretary concludes that the information is accurate, 
include a brief statement by the physician, dentist or other health care 
practitioner describing the disagreement concerning the information, and 
an explanation of the basis for the decision that it is accurate, or
    (ii) If the Secretary concludes that the information was incorrect, 
send corrected information to previous inquirers.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 61.1  The Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank.

    (a) Section 1128E of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to implement 
a national health care fraud and abuse data collection program for the 
reporting and disclosing of certain final adverse actions taken against 
health care providers, suppliers, or practitioners. Section 1128E of the 
Act also directs the Secretary to maintain a database of final adverse 
actions taken against health care providers, suppliers or practitioners. 
This data bank will be known as the Healthcare Integrity and Protection 
Data Bank (HIPDB). Settlements in which no findings or admissions of 
liability have been made will be excluded from being reported. However, 
if another action is taken against the provider, supplier or 
practitioner of a health care item or service as a result of or in 
conjunction with the settlement, that action is reportable to the HIPDB.
    (b) Section 1128E of the Act also requires the Secretary to 
implement the HIPDB in such a manner as to avoid duplication with the 
reporting requirements established for the National Practitioner Data 
Bank (NPDB) (See 45 CFR part 60). In accordance with the statute, the 
reporter responsible for reporting the final adverse actions to

[[Page 143]]

both the HIPDB and the NPDB will be required to submit only one report, 
provided that reporting is made through the Department's consolidated 
reporting mechanism that will sort the appropriate actions into the 
HIPDB, NPDB, or both.
    (c) The regulations in this part set forth the reporting and 
disclosure requirements for the HIPDB.


<R05>
Sec. 61.2  Applicability of these regulations.

    The regulations in this part establish reporting requirements 
applicable to Federal and State Government agencies and to health plans, 
as the terms are defined under Sec. 61.3.


<R05>
Sec. 61.3  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Act means the Social Security Act.
    Affiliated or associated means health care entities with which a 
subject of a final adverse action has a commercial relationship, 
including but not limited to, organizations, associations, corporations, 
or partnerships. It also includes a professional corporation or other 
business entity composed of a single individual.
    Any other negative action or finding by a Federal or State licensing 
agency means any action or finding that under the State's law is 
publicly available information, and rendered by a licensing or 
certification authority, including but not limited to, limitations on 
the scope of practice, liquidations, injunctions and forfeitures. This 
definition also includes final adverse actions rendered by a Federal or 
State licensing or certification authority, such as exclusions, 
revocations or suspension of license or certification that occur in 
conjunction with settlements in which no finding of liability has been 
made (although such a settlement itself is not reportable under the 
statute). This definition excludes citations, corrective action plans 
and personnel actions.
    Civil judgment means a court-ordered action rendered in a Federal or 
State court proceeding, other than a criminal proceeding. This reporting 
requirement does not include Consent Judgments that have been agreed 
upon and entered to provide security for civil settlements in which 
there was no finding or admission of liability.
    Criminal conviction means a conviction as described in section 
1128(i) of the Act.
    Exclusion means a temporary or permanent debarment of an individual 
or entity from participation in any Federal or State health-related 
program, in accordance with which items or services furnished by such 
person or entity will not be reimbursed under any Federal or State 
health-related program.
    Government agency includes, but is not limited to--
    (1) The U.S. Department of Justice;
    (2) The U.S Department of Health and Human Services;
    (3) Any other Federal agency that either administers or provides 
payment for the delivery of health care services, including, but not 
limited to, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs;
    (4) Federal and State law enforcement agencies, including States 
Attorneys General and law enforcement investigators;
    (5) State Medicaid Fraud Control Units; and
    (6) Federal or State agencies responsible for the licensing and 
certification of health care providers, suppliers or licensed health 
care practitioners. Examples of such State agencies include Departments 
of Professional Regulation, Health, Social Services (including State 
Survey and Certification and Medicaid Single State agencies), Commerce 
and Insurance.
    Health care provider means a provider of services as defined in 
section 1861(u) of the Act; any health care entity (including a health 
maintenance organization, preferred provider organization or group 
medical practice) that provides health care services and follows a 
formal peer review process for the purpose of furthering quality health 
care, and any other health care entity that, directly or through 
contracts, provides health care services.
    Health care supplier means a provider of medical and other health 
care services as described in section 1861(s) of the Act; or any 
individual or entity, other than a provider, who furnishes,

[[Page 144]]

whether directly or indirectly, or provides access to, health care 
services, supplies, items, or ancillary services (including, but not 
limited to, durable medical equipment suppliers, manufacturers of health 
care items, pharmaceutical suppliers and manufacturers, health record 
services such as medical, dental and patient records, health data 
suppliers, and billing and transportation service suppliers). The term 
also includes any individual or entity under contract to provide such 
supplies, items or ancillary services; health plans as defined in this 
section (including employers that are self-insured); and health 
insurance producers (including but not limited to agents, brokers, 
solicitors, consultants and reinsurance intermediaries).
    Health plan means a plan, program or organization that provides 
health benefits, whether directly, through insurance, reimbursement or 
otherwise, and includes but is not limited to--
    (1) A policy of health insurance;
    (2) A contract of a service benefit organization;
    (3) A membership agreement with a health maintenance organization or 
other prepaid health plan;
    (4) A plan, program, agreement or other mechanism established, 
maintained or made available by a self insured employer or group of self 
insured employers, a practitioner, provider or supplier group, third 
party administrator, integrated health care delivery system, employee 
welfare association, public service group or organization or 
professional association; and
    (5) An insurance company, insurance service or insurance 
organization that is licensed to engage in the business of selling 
health care insurance in a State and which is subject to State law which 
regulates health insurance.
    Licensed health care practitioner, licensed practitioner, or 
practitioner means, with respect to a State, an individual who is 
licensed or otherwise authorized by the State to provide health care 
services (or any individual who, without authority, holds himself or 
herself out to be so licensed or authorized).
    Organization name means the subject's business or employer at the 
time the underlying acts occurred. If more than one business or employer 
is involved, the one most closely related to the underlying acts should 
be reported in the ``organization name,'' field with the others being 
reported in the ``affiliated or associated health care entities'' field.
    Organization type means a brief description of the nature of that 
business or employer.
    Other adjudicated actions or decisions means formal or official 
final actions taken against a health care provider, supplier or 
practitioner by a Federal or State governmental agency or a health plan; 
which include the availability of a due process mechanism, and; are 
based on acts or omissions that affect or could affect the payment, 
provision or delivery of a health care item or service. For example, a 
formal or official final action taken by a Federal or State governmental 
agency or a health plan may include, but is not limited to, a personnel-
related action such as suspensions without pay, reductions in pay, 
reductions in grade for cause, terminations or other comparable actions. 
A hallmark of any valid adjudicated action or decision is the 
availability of a due process mechanism. The fact that the subject 
elects not to use the due process mechanism provided by the authority 
bringing the action is immaterial, as long as such a process is 
available to the subject before the adjudicated action or decision is 
made final. In general, if an ``adjudicated action or decision'' follows 
an agency's established administrative procedures (which ensure that due 
process is available to the subject of the final adverse action), it 
would qualify as a reportable action under this definition. This 
definition specifically excludes clinical privileging actions taken by 
Federal or State Government agencies and similar paneling decisions made 
by health plans. This definition does not include overpayment 
determinations made by Federal or State Government programs, their 
contractors or health plans; and it does not include denial of claims 
determinations made by Government agencies or health plans. For health 
plans that are not Government entities, an action taken following 
adequate notice and the opportunity for a hearing that meets the 
standards of

[[Page 145]]

due process set out in section 412(b) of the HCQIA (42 U.S.C. 11112(b)) 
also would qualify as a reportable action under this definition.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and any 
other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services 
to whom the authority involved has been delegated.
    State means any of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam.
    Voluntary surrender means a surrender made after a notification of 
investigation or a formal official request by a Federal or State 
licensing or certification authority for a health care provider, 
supplier or practitioner to surrender the license or certification 
(including certification agreements or contracts for participation in 
Federal or State health care programs). The definition also includes 
those instances where a health care provider, supplier or practitioner 
voluntarily surrenders a license or certification (including program 
participation agreements or contracts) in exchange for a decision by the 
licensing or certification authority to cease an investigation or 
similar proceeding, or in return for not conducting an investigation or 
proceeding, or in lieu of a disciplinary action.

  Subpart C--Disclosure of Information by the Healthcare Integrity and 
                          Protection Data Bank


<R05>
Sec. 61.12  Requesting information from the Healthcare Integrity and 
Protection Data Bank.

    (a) Who may request information and what information may be 
available. Information in the HIPDB will be available, upon request, to 
the following persons or entities, or their authorized agents--
    (1) Federal and State Government agencies;
    (2) Health plans;
    (3) A health care practitioner, provider, or supplier requesting 
information concerning himself, herself or itself; and
    (4) A person or entity requesting statistical information, which 
does not permit identification of any individual or entity. (For 
example, researchers can use statistical information to identify the 
total number of practitioners excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs. Similarly, health plans can use statistical information to 
develop outcome measures in their efforts to monitor and improve quality 
care.)
    (b) Procedures for obtaining HIPDB information. Eligible individuals 
and entities may obtain information from the HIPDB by submitting a 
request in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe. These 
requests are subject to fees set forth in Sec. 61.13. The HIPDB will 
comply with the Department's principles of fair information practice by 
providing each subject of a report with

[[Page 151]]

a copy when the report is entered into the HIPDB.
    (c) Information provided in response to self-queries. (1) At the 
time subjects request information as part of a ``self-query,'' the 
subject will receive--
    (i) Any report(s) in the HIPDB specific to them; and
    (ii) A disclosure history from the HIPDB of the name(s) of any 
entity (or entities) that have previously received the report(s).
    (2) The disclosure history will be restricted in accordance with the 
Privacy Act regulations set forth in 45 CFR part 5b.


<R05>
Sec. 61.13  Fees applicable to requests for information.

    (a) Policy on fees. The fees described in this section apply to all 
requests for information from the HIPDB, except requests from Federal 
agencies. However, for purposes of verification and dispute resolution 
at the time the report is accepted, the HIPDB will provide a copy--at 
the time a report has been submitted automatically, without a request 
and free of charge--of every report to the health care provider, 
supplier or practitioner who is the subject of the report. For the same 
purpose, the Department will provide a copy of the report--at the time a 
report has been submitted automatically, without a request and free of 
charge--to the reporter that submitted it. The fees are authorized by 
section 1128E(d)(2) of the Act, and they reflect the full costs of 
operating the database. The actual fees will be announced by the 
Secretary in periodic notices in the Federal Register.
    (b) Criteria for determining the fee. The amount of each fee will be 
determined based on the following criteria --
    (1) Direct and indirect personnel costs;
    (2) Physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs 
including rent and depreciation on land, buildings and equipment;
    (3) Agency management and supervisory costs;
    (4) Costs of enforcement, research and establishment of regulations 
and guidance;
    (5) Use of electronic data processing equipment to collect and 
maintain information--the actual cost of the service, including computer 
search time, runs and printouts; and
    (6) Any other direct or indirect costs related to the provision of 
services.
    (c) Assessing and collecting fees. The Secretary will announce 
through periodic notice in the Federal Register the method of payment of 
fees. In determining these methods, the Secretary will consider 
efficiency, effectiveness and convenience for users and for the 
Department. Methods may include credit card, electronic funds transfer 
and other methods of electronic payment.


<R05>
Sec. 61.14  Confidentiality of Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data 
Bank information.

    Information reported to the HIPDB is considered confidential and 
will not be disclosed outside the Department, except as specified in 
Sec.Sec. 61.12 and 61.15. Persons and entities receiving information 
from the HIPDB, either directly or from another party, must use it 
solely with respect to the purpose for which it was provided. Nothing in 
this section will prevent the disclosure of information by a party from 
its own files used to create such reports where disclosure is otherwise 
authorized under applicable State or Federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 61.15  How to dispute the accuracy of Healthcare Integrity and Protection 
Data Bank information.

    (a) Who may dispute the HIPDB information. The HIPDB will routinely 
mail or transmit electronically to the subject a copy of the report 
filed in the HIPDB. In addition, as indicated in Sec. 61.12(a)(3), the 
subject may also request a copy of such report. The subject of the 
report or a designated representative may dispute the accuracy of a 
report concerning himself, herself or itself as set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (b) Procedures for disputing a report with the reporting entity. If 
the subject disagrees with the reported information, the subject must 
request in writing that the HIPDB enter the report into ``disputed 
status.''
    (2) The HIPDB will send the report, with a notation that the report 
has been placed in ``disputed status,'' to

[[Page 152]]

queriers (where identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of 
the report.
    (3) The subject must attempt to enter into discussion with the 
reporting entity to resolve the dispute. If the reporting entity revises 
the information originally submitted to the HIPDB, the HIPDB will notify 
the subject and all entities to whom reports have been sent that the 
original information has been revised. If the reporting entity does not 
revise the reported information, or does not respond to the subject 
within 60 days, the subject may request that the Secretary review the 
report for accuracy. The Secretary will decide whether to correct the 
report within 30 days of the request. This time frame may be extended 
for good cause. The subject also may provide a statement to the HIPDB, 
either directly or through a designated representative, that will 
permanently append the report.
    (c) Procedures for requesting a Secretarial review. The subject must 
request, in writing, that the Secretary of the Department review the 
report for accuracy. The subject must return this request to the HIPDB 
along with appropriate materials that support the subject's position. 
The Secretary will only review the accuracy of the reported information, 
and will not consider the merits or appropriateness of the action or the 
due process that the subject received.
    (2) After the review, if the Secretary--
    (i) Concludes that the information is accurate and reportable to the 
HIPDB, the Secretary will inform the subject and the HIPDB of the 
determination. The Secretary will include a brief statement (Secretarial 
Statement) in the report that describes the basis for the decision. The 
report will be removed from ``disputed status.'' The HIPDB will 
distribute the corrected report and statement(s) to previous queriers 
(where identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the 
report.
    (ii) Concludes that the information contained in the report is 
inaccurate, the Secretary will inform the subject of the determination 
and direct the HIPDB or the reporting entity to revise the report. The 
Secretary will include a brief statement (Secretarial Statement) in the 
report describing the findings. The HIPDB will distribute the corrected 
report and statement (s) to previous queriers (where identifiable), the 
reporting entity and the subject of the report.
    (iii) Determines that the disputed issues are outside the scope of 
the Department's review, the Secretary will inform the subject and the 
HIPDB of the determination. The Secretary will include a brief statement 
(Secretarial Statement) in the report describing the findings. The 
report will be removed from ``disputed status.'' The HIPDB will 
distribute the report and the statement(s) to previous queriers (where 
identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the report.
    (iv) Determines that the adverse action was not reportable and 
therefore should be removed from the HIPDB, the Secretary will inform 
the subject and direct the HIPDB to void the report. The HIPDB will 
distribute a notice to previous queriers (where identifiable), the 
reporting entity and the subject of the report that the report has been 
voided.

<R05>
Sec. 61.16  Immunity.

    Individuals, entities or their authorized agents and the HIPDB shall 
not be held liable in any civil action filed by the subject of a report 
unless the individual, entity or authorized agent submitting the report 
has actual knowledge of the falsity of the information contained in the 
report.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-101  Purpose.

    To assure that the business of the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) is conducted effectively, objectively, and without 
improper influence or the appearance of improper influence, employees 
and special Government employees must be persons of integrity and must 
observe high standards of honesty, impartiality, and behavior. They must 
not engage in any conduct prejudicial to the Government

[[Page 162]]

and must avoid conflicts of private interests with public duties and 
responsibilities. In accord with these principles, the regulations in 
this part are issued to inform HHS employees and special Government 
employees what standards of conduct are expected of them in performing 
their duties and what activities are permitted or prohibited both while 
they are employed and after their employment with the Department is 
ended.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-102  Definitions.

    In this part:
    (a) Employee means an officer or employee of HHS other than a 
special Government employee and includes Commissioned Officers of the 
Public Health Service who are on active duty, and individuals on 
assignment or detail to HHS pursuant to the Intergovernmental Personnel 
Act (5 U.S.C. 3371-3376). The term also includes HHS employees who are 
detailed to non-Federal or other Federal organizations. At times the 
term ``regular employee'' is used in place of ``employee'' to make a 
clear distinction between special Government employees and others 
employed by the Federal government.
    (b) Special Government employee means an individual who is retained, 
designated, appointed, or employed to perform temporary duties either on 
a full-time or intermittent basis, with or without compensation, for not 
to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days.
    (c) Person means an individual, a corporation, a company, an 
association, a firm, a partnership or any other organization.
    (d) Former employee means a former employee of HHS or former special 
Government employee as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Principal Operating Component has the meaning given to that term 
in the Department's General Administration Manual. In addition, when 
used in these regulations, it includes the Office of the Secretary.
    (f) Department means the Department of Health and Human Services.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-103  Applicability.

    (a) The regulations in this part apply to all employees of the 
Department and to special Government employees to the extent indicated 
in Subparts J and K. They apply whether an employee is on leave, 
including leave without pay, or on duty.
    (b) These regulations may be supplemented by regulations governing 
principal operating components, or sub-units of principal operating 
components, provided the clearance and publication requirements for 
standards of conduct regulations are met and approval is obtained from 
the Department Ethics Counselor and the Assistant Secretary for 
Personnel Administration.


<R04>
                       Subpart B--Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-201  Employees and supervisors.

    (a) Employees and special Government employees shall be responsible 
for observing all generally accepted rules of conduct and the specific 
provisions of law and the regulations of this part that apply to them. 
They are required to become familiar with these regulations and to 
exercise informed judgments to avoid misconduct or conflicts of 
interest. They shall secure approvals when required and file financial 
disclosure reports or statements in accordance with the provisions of 
this part. Failure to observe any of these regulations may be cause for 
disciplinary action. Some of the provisions are required by law and 
carry criminal penalties which are in addition to any disciplinary 
action which could be taken. When employees have doubts about any 
provision, they should consult their supervisor, personnel office, or 
the Department Ethics Counselor or a deputy counselor.
    (b) Supervisors, because of their day-to-day relationships with 
employees, are responsible to a large degree for making sure high 
standards of conduct are maintained. They must become familiar with the 
Department's standards of conduct regulations and apply the standards to 
the work they do and supervise. Supervisors shall take suitable action, 
including disciplinary action in accordance with Subpart L of these 
regulations, when violations occur.

[[Page 163]]


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-202  Management officials.

    (a) The Department has an obligation to enforce the requirements of 
this part in all respects and to help employees, special Government 
employees, and supervisors carry out their responsibilities to maintain 
high standards of ethical conduct. This includes an obligation for 
managers to provide information and training concerning the HHS conduct 
regulations, to provide advice and guidance with respect to them, and to

Department are kept informed of developments in conflict of interest 
laws and other related matters of ethics.
    (3) Receiving information on conflicts of interest and appearances 
of conflicts of interest involving employees of the Department and 
forwarding this information to the appropriate management official, or 
the Inspector General, as necessary, with his or her legal evaluation of 
the matters addressed.
    (4) Reviewing the financial disclosure reports, requests for 
approval of outside activities, and similar reports filed by Executive

Schedule C employees in the Office of the Secretary for the purpose of 
identifying and resolving possible and actual conflicts of interest.
    (5) Maintaining liaison with the Office of Government Ethics.
    (6) Advising management officials on the resolution of conflicts of 
interest by any of the remedies set forth in Sec. 73.735-904 of this 
part.
    (7) Maintaining accurate and complete documentation of all formal

the provisions of this part, except for routine or repetitious cases 
where the guidance given is not precedential.
    (8) Maintaining and publishing from time to time a list of those 
circumstances or situations which have resulted or may result in 
noncompliance with conflict of interest laws or regulations. [Section 
206(b)(7), Pub. L. 95-521].
    (9) Designating and training an appropriate number of reviewing 
officials to assist him or her in carrying out the duties of the 
Designated Agency Offical under the Ethics in Government Act.
    (10) Maintaining effective lines of communication with deputy ethics

    (c) Deputy Ethics Counselors. Assistant General Counsels and 
Regional Attorneys are designated deputy ethics counselors to assist the 
Department's Counselor in carrying out his or her responsibilities, 
particularly with respect to employees in the organization in which the 
deputy counselor serves. Regional Attorneys shall provide such 
assistance for all employees of the Department in organizations for 
which the Principal Regional Official provides personnel services.
    (d) The Assistant Secretary for Personnel Administration shall be 
responsible for developing and issuing procedures and requirements for 
the implementation of these regulations and for monitoring the 
application of such procedures and requirements throughout the 
Department.
    (e) Heads of Principal Operating Components and the Assistant 
Secretary for Management and Budget for the Office of the Secretary 
shall be ultimately responsible for assuring that persons who work for 
their respective

[[Page 164]]

organizations comply with the standards of this part. Their 
responsibilities shall include:
    (1) Designating officials to review and approve outside activity 
requests in accordance with Sec. 73.735-708 of this part or statements 
of employment or financial interests under Sec. 73.735-902. A list of 
the officials designated for these purposes shall be provided to the 
Department Ethics Counselor and to the Assistant Secretary for Personnel 
Administration and shall be updated in January and July of each year.
    (2) Designating for the components of his or her organization, other 
than those for which a principal regional official provides personnel 
services, one or more individuals to oversee and coordinate the 
administrative aspects of these regulations. Responsibilities of such a 
person include making sure each employee or special government employee 
is provided a copy of these regulations, or an appropriate summary 
thereof; ensuring that training in the requirements of the regulations 
is provided to supervisors and to new employees; providing for the 
distribution, receipt, review and retention of financial interest

<R04>
                      Subpart C--Conduct on the Job


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-301  Courtesy and consideration for others.

    (a) An employee's conduct on the job is, in all respects, of concern 
to the Federal government. Courtesy, consideration, and promptness in 
dealing with the public must be shown in carrying out official 
responsibilities, and actions which deny the dignity of individuals or 
conduct which is disrespectful to others must be avoided. Employees must 
recognize that inattention to matters of common courtesy can adversely 
affect the quality of service the Department is responsible for 
providing. Where appropriate, courtesy to the public should be included 
in the standards for employee performance.
    (b) Of equal importance is the requirement that courtesy be shown in 
day-by-day interaction with co-workers. Employees shall be polite to and 
considerate of other employees, and shall respect their needs and 
concerns in the work environment.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-302  Support of department programs.

    (a) When a Department program is based on law, Executive Order or 
regulation, every employee has a positive obligation to make it function 
as efficiently and economically as possible and to support it as long as 
it is a part of recognized public policy. An employee may, therefore, 
properly make an address explaining and interpreting such a program, 
citing its achievements, defending it against uninformed or unjust 
criticism, or soliciting views for improving it.
    (b) An employee shall not, either directly or indirectly, use 
appropriated funds to influence, or attempt to influence, a Member of 
Congress to favor or oppose legislation. However, when authorized by his 
or her supervisor, an employee is not prohibited from:
    (1) Testifying, on request, as a representative of the Department on 
pending legislation or proposals before Congressional Committees; or
    (2) Assisting Congressional Committees in drafting bills or reports 
on request, when it is clear that the employee is serving solely as a 
technical expert under the direction of committee leadership.
    (c) All employees shall be familiar with regulations and published 
instructions that relate to their official duties and responsibilities 
and shall comply with those directives. This includes carrying out 
proper orders from officials authorized to give them.

[[Page 165]]

    (d) Employees are required to assist the Inspector General and other 
investigative officials in the performance of their duties or functions. 
This requirement includes the giving of statements or evidence to 
investigators of the Inspector General's office or other HHS 
investigators authorized to conduct investigations into potential 
violations.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-303  Use of government funds.

    (a) An employee shall not:
    (1) Improperly use official travel;
    (2) Improperly use payroll and other vouchers and documents on which 
Government payments are based;
    (3) Take or fail to account for funds with which the employee is 
entrusted in his or her official position; or
    (4) Take other Government funds for personal use. Violation of these 
prohibitions carry criminal penalties.
    (b) In addition, employees shall avoid wasteful actions or behavior 
in the performance of their assigned duties.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-304  Use of government property.

    (a) An employee shall not directly or indirectly use, or allow the 
use of, Government property of any kind, including property leased to 
the Government, for other than officially approved activities. An 
Employee has a positive duty to protect and conserve Government 
property, including equipment, supplies, and other property entrusted or 
issued to him or her. For example:
    (1) Only official documents and materials may be processed on 
Government reproduction facilities. Both supervisors and employees must 
assure that this rule is strictly followed. (Exception for employee 
welfare and recreation associations is stated in Chapter 25-10, General 
Administration Manual. Exception for labor organizations is stated in 
Personnel Instruction 711-1.)
    (2) Employees may drive or use Government automobiles or aircraft 
only on official business. Use of a Government owned, leased, or rented 
vehicle or aircraft for non-official purposes may result in suspension 
for at least 30 days or removal from the Federal service. 31 U.S.C. 
638a.

    Example: Normally, use of a Government automobile by travel between 
home and place of duty would not be considered official business and 
could not be authorized. An exception to this rule might be appropriate 
in a situation where an employee is required to leave early in the 
morning to attend a meeting in a distant city, or to return late in the 
day from such a meeting. Allowing the employee to drive a government car 
to his or her home the night before in order to leave from home, or to 
return to his or her home in the evening upon completion of the trip is 
permissible, provided the employee does not use the car for any personal 
reason.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-305  Conduct in Federal buildings.

    (a) An employee shall not participate while on Government-owned or 
leased property or while on duty for the Government, in any gambling 
activity including the operation of a gambling device, in conducting a 
lottery or pool, in a game for money or property, or in selling or 
purchasing a numbers slip or ticket.
    (b) An employee shall not while in or on Government-owned or leased 
property or while on duty for the Government solicit alms and 
contributions, engage in commercial soliciting and vending, display or 
distribute commercial advertisements, or collect private debts.
    (c) The prohibitions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do 
not preclude:
    (1) Activities necessitated by an employee's law enforcement duties;
    (2) Participation in Federally sponsored fund-raising activities 
conducted pursuant to Executive Order 10927, or similar HHS-approved 
activities; or
    (3) Buying a lottery ticket at an authorized State lottery outlet 
for a lottery authorized by State law and conducted by an agency of a 
State within that State.
    (d) General Services Administration regulations on ``Conduct on 
Federal Property'' apply to all property under the control of the 
General Services Administration, and they are also applicable to all 
buildings and space under the control of this Department. These 
regulations prohibit, among other things, gambling, being intoxicated, 
and possession, distribution, or use of narcotic or dangerous drugs on 
the premises. The GSA regulations are found in Subpart 101-20.3 of the 
GSA Regulations, 41 CFR 101-20.3.

[[Page 166]]


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-306  Sexual harassment.

    Sexual harassment is deliberate unsolicited verbal comments, 
gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature which are unwelcome. 
Sexual harassment is unacceptable conduct and is expressly prohibited. 
In addition, supervisors and managers are prohibited from taking or 
promising personnel actions in exchange for sexual favors, or failing to 
take an action because an employee or applicant for employment, refuses 
to engage in sexual conduct. This same prohibition applies to 
relationships between Department personnel who take or recommend action 
on a grant or contract and the grantee or contractor. Those employees 
who wish to file a complaint of sexual harassment should contact the 
Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) within their respective 
agencies for guidance. (Time frames for pursuing a charge alleging 
sexual harassment are the same as for any other complaint based on 
allegations of sex discrimination.)


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-307  Use of official information.

    (a) The public interest requires that certain information in the 
possession of the Government be kept confidential, and released only 
with general or specific authority under Department or operating 
component regulations. Such information may involve the national 
security or be private, personal, or business information which has been 
furnished to the Government in confidence. In addition, information in 
the possession of the Government and not generally available may not be 
used for private gain. The following paragraphs set forth the rules to 
be followed by Department employees in handling information in official 
files or documents:
    (1) Classified information. Employees who have access to information 
which is classified for security reasons in accordance with Executive 
Order 12065 are responsible for its custody and safekeeping, and for 
assuring that it is not disclosed to unauthorized persons. See the 
Department's Security Manual, Part 3 for details.
    (2) Security and investigative information. Security and 
investigative data received from Government agencies or other sources 
for official use only within the Department or developed under a pledge 
of confidence is not to be divulged to unauthorized persons or agencies.
    (3) Information obtained in confidence. Certain Department units 
(e.g., Food and Drug Administration, and the Social Security 
Administration) obtain in the course of their program activities certain 
information from businesses or individuals which they are forbidden by 
law from disclosing. These statutory prohibitions are found in 21 U.S.C. 
331j, and 18 U.S.C. 1905. Each employee is responsible for observing 
these laws.
    (4) Use of information for private gain. Government employees are 
sometimes able to obtain information about some action the Government is 
about to take or some other matter which is not generally known. 
Information of this kind shall not be used by the employee to further 
his or her or someone else's private financial or other interests. Such 
a use of official information is clearly a violation of a public trust. 
Employees shall not, directly or indirectly, make use of, or permit 
others to make use of, for the purpose of furthering any private 
interest, official information not made available to the general public.
    (b) The Privacy Act provides criminal penalties for an employee who 
willfully discloses individually identifiable information from records, 
disclosure of which is prohibited by that Act. 5 U.S.C. 552a(i).


<R04>
                    Subpart D--Financial Obligations


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-401  General provisions.

    (a) The Department considers the indebtedness of its employees to be 
a matter of their own concern. However, employees shall not by failure 
to meet their just financial obligations reflect adversely on the 
Government as their employer. Employees are expected to pay each just 
financial obligation in a proper and timely manner. A ``just financial 
obligation'' is one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to judgment 
by a court, or one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local

[[Page 167]]

taxes. ``In a proper and timely manner'' is a manner which the 
Department determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect 
adversely on the part of an employee in meeting his or her financial 
obligations, particularly those that relate to support of the employee's 
family, to payment of Federal, State, or local taxes, or to payments to 
tax-supported institutions such as a city or State hospital, or 
educational institution. If for some reason an employee is unable to pay 
these obligations promptly, he or she is expected to make satisfactory 
arrangements for payment and abide by these arrangements.
    (b) Disciplinary action may be considered when an employee has 
handled his or her financial affairs in such a way that:
    (1) Action on complaints received from creditors requires the use of 
a considerable amount of official time, or
    (2) It appears that financial difficulties are impairing the 
employee's efficiency on the job, or
    (3) Because of the employee's financial irresponsibility, the 
attitude of the general public toward the Department may be adversely 
affected; and the employee after counseling does not make arrangements 
to meet his or her financial obligations.


<R04>
               Subpart E--Gifts, Entertainment, and Favors


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-501  Prohibited acceptance of gifts, entertainment, and favors.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec.Sec. 73.735-502 and 73.735-506, an 
employee shall not directly or indirectly solicit or accept anything of 
monetary value, including gifts, gratuities, favors, entertainment or 
loans from a person who the employee knows, or should know because of 
the nature of the employee's work:
    (1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or 
financial relations with the employee's principal operating component, 
or sub-unit thereof; or with a component of the Department with respect 
to which the employee has official duties;
    (2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the 
employee's principal operating component, or sub-unit thereof or by a 
component of the Department with respect to which the employee has 
official duties; or
    (3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or non-performance of the employee's official duties.
    (b) Employees may not designate a person or an organization, 
including charitable or non-profit organizations, to accept any gift 
which an employee is prohibited from accepting directly.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-502  Permissible acceptance of gifts, entertainment, and favors.

    (a) An employee may accept a gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, 
loan or similar favor of monetary value which stems from a family 
relationship such as that between the employee and his or her parents, 
spouse or children, if it is clear that the relationship is the 
motivating factor.
    (b) Loans from banks or other financial institutions may be accepted 
on customary terms.
    (c) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material such as pens, 
note pads, calendars and similar items of nominal intrinsic value may be 
accepted.
    (d) An employee may accept food or refreshment of nominal value on 
infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner 
meeting or on an inspection tour only if the employee is properly in 
attendance and there is not a reasonable opportunity to pay.

    Example 1: Employee is on the premises of Company participating in a 
meeting at a normal mealtime. A representative of Company provides a 
meal for all meeting participants from a Company facility and there is 
no established method for payment. Employee may accept.
    Example 2: Employee is on the premises of Company and he or she goes 
outside for lunch with a representative of the Company. The 
representative offers to pay the bill. Since it is practical for the 
employee to pay for his or her own meal, the employee may not accept.

    (e) An employee may also accept food or refreshment of nominal value 
on infrequent occasions if the food and/or refreshment is offered to all 
participants or attendees of a meeting or convention.


[[Page 168]]


    Example 1: During the course of a convention of a professional 
organization a luncheon open to all attendees is sponsored by a 
corporation which conducts business with the Department and the employee 
has official dealings with representatives of the corporation. The 
employee may attend the luncheon.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-503  Criminal provisions relating to gifts, entertainment, and favors.

    (a) The law provides criminal penalties for whoever, directly or 
indirectly:
    (1) Receives or accepts anything of value for or because of any 
official act the employee has performed or will perform; or
    (2) Gives, offers or promises anything of value for the performance 
of an official act or to influence the performance of an official act. 
18 USC 201.
    (b) The law prohibits an employee from receiving any salary or any 
contribution to, or supplementation of, his or her salary as 
compensation for services as an officer or employee of the Government 
from any source other than the United States or any State, county or 
municipality. This law does not prohibit an employee from continuing to 
participate in a bona fide pension, retirement, group life, health or 
accident insurance, profit-sharing, stock bonus or other employee 
welfare or benefit plan maintained by a former employer. 18 U.S.C. 209.

    Example 1: A corporate executive is asked to accept a position in 
the Department. The corporation offers to continue to pay the executive 
the difference between his or her salary as a Government employee and 
that received by an employee of the corporation. Such payment would be 
considered to be ``compensation for'' the employee's Government service 
and is prohibited.
    Example 2: A corporate executive is asked to accept a position in 
the Department. The corporation proposes to pay him or her a special 
severance payment in anticipation of this or her serving in the 
Government. This proposal would be prohibited because there is no 
distinction between the proposed lump-sum payment and the prohibited 
continuation of salary payments described in the example above.
    Example 3: A corporate executive is asked to accept a position in 
the Department. The corporation has an established policy which provides 
for an amount of severance pay to be paid any departing executive and 
proposes to make payment based on that policy when the executive leaves. 
The executive may accept the payment. Under these circumstances it is 
clear that the severance pay is in payment for past services not in 
anticipation of the future services for the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-504  Gifts to official superiors.

    An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another employee 
for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an 
official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay 
than himself or herself. 5 U.S.C. 7351. This section does not prohibit a 
voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in nominal amount made on a 
special occasion such as marriage, illness or retirement.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-505  Acceptance of awards and prizes.

    (a) Employees may accept awards, including cash awards, given in 
recognition of a meritorious public contribution or achievement. 
However, if there is any indication that the award may improperly 
influence the employee in the performance of his or her offical duties, 
advice about the acceptance of it should be sought from a deputy ethics 
counselor. Also, an employee may not accept an award from an 
organization which the employee knows, or should know, has a contractual 
or other business arrangement with, or is regulated by, the principal 
operating component, or a sub-unit, in which he or she is employed or 
with respect to which the employee has official duties, unless 
acceptance is approved by the head of the employee's principal operating 
component. The head of the component may not approve acceptance unless 
he or she is satisfied that no actual conflict of interest would result.
    (b) Employees may generally accept trophies, entertainment, rewards, 
and prizes given to competitors in contests or events which are open to 
the public.
    (c) Employees may not accept gifts, awards, decorations or other 
things of value from a foreign government except as provided in Sec. 
73.735-506.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-506  Gifts and decorations from foreign governments.

    (a) An employee may not request or otherwise encourage the tender of 
a

[[Page 169]]

gift or decorations from a foreign government or official thereof.
    (b) An employee may accept from a foreign government:
    (1) A gift which is in the nature of medical treatment or an 
educational scholarship;
    (2) A tangible gift of minimal value tendered or received as a mark 
of courtesy; (``Minimal value'' means a retail value in the United 
States at the time of acceptance of not more than one hundred dollars, 
unless the Administrator of the General Services Administration adjusts 
the value by regulation.) or
    (3) A tangible gift of more than minimal value when it appears that 
to refuse the gift would be likely to cause offense or embarrassment or 
otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. 
However, the acceptance of such a gift would be on behalf of the United 
States and the gift would become the property of the United States. See 
the Department's General Administration Manual, Chapter 20-25 for 
information regarding the disposition of a gift accepted under these 
circumstances.
    (c) An employee may also accept from a foreign government gifts of 
travel or expenses for travel (such as transportation, food and lodging) 
that take place entirely outside the United States and are of more than 
minimal value, if such acceptance is consistent with the interests of 
the United States and is approved by the travel approving authority in 
accordance with the Department's Travel Manual. See General 
Administration Manual, Chapter 20-25 for a requirement to report such 
travel.
    (d) An employee may accept, retain, and wear a decoration tendered 
in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or 
awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance, 
subject to the approval of the Secretary or his or her designee.
    (e) Members of an employee's family and household are also subject 
to the regulations in this section. A member of an employee's family and 
household is a relative by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident 
of the household. However, if a member of an employee's family and 
household is employed by another agency of the Government, the offer or 
acceptance of a gift shall be treated under the regulations of that 
agency.
    (f) For purposes of this section ``foreign government'' means:
    (1) Any unit of foreign government authority including any foreign 
national, state, local and municipal government;
    (2) Any international or multinational organization whose membership 
is composed of any unit of foreign government described in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section; or
    (3) Any agent or representative of any such unit or organization 
when acting as such agent or representative. (5 U.S.C. 7342)


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-507  Acceptance of travel and subsistence.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, employees 
may accept accommodations, subsistence, and travel in cash or in kind in 
connection with official travel for attendance at meetings, conferences, 
training in non-Governmental facilities or for performing advisory 
services, if approved in accordance with the provisions of the HHS 
Travel Manual. (5 U.S.C. 4111; 42 U.S.C. 3506)
    (b) Employees may not accept accommodations, subsistence, or travel 
in cash or in kind in connection with official travel from a non-
Governmental source with which they have official dealings unless 
Government or commercial travel and/or accommodations are not available. 
If travel and/or subsistence is accepted for official travel under these 
circumstances, such acceptance and the basis for it must be reported in 
writing to the Head of the Principal Operating Component or Assistant 
Secretary for Management and Budget for the Office of the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-508  Other prohibitions.

    Employees shall avoid any action whether or not specifically 
prohibited by this part, which might result in or create the appearance 
of:
    (a) Using public office for private gain;
    (b) Giving preferential treatment to any person;

[[Page 170]]

    (c) Impeding Government efficiency or economy;
    (d) Losing complete independence or impartiality in the performance 
of their Government duties;
    (e) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or
    (f) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Government.


<R04>
                      Subpart F--Political Activity


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-601  Applicability.

    (a) All employees in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, 
including non-career employees, are subject to basic political activity 
restrictions in subchapter III of chapter 73 of title 5, United States 
Code (the former Hatch Act) and Civil Service Rule IV. Employees are 
individually responsible for refraining from prohibited political 
activity. Ignorance of a prohibition does not excuse a violation. This 
subpart summarizes provisions of law and regulation concerning political 
activity of employees. The Federal Personnel Manual and other 
publications of the Office of Personnel Management contain more detailed 
information on this subject. These may be reviewed in Department 
personnel offices, or will be made available by the Ethics Counselor, or 
the deputy counselor for the employee's organizational component.
    (b) The Secretary and Under Secretary are exempt from the 
prohibitions concerning active participation in political management and 
political campaigns. Also exempt are other officials of the Department, 
except the Inspector General and Deputy Inspector General, who are 
appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, and who determine policies to be pursued by the United States in 
the nationwide administration of Federal laws.
    (c) Intermittent employees are subject to the restrictions when in 
active duty status only and for the entire 24 hours of any day of actual 
employment.
    (d) Employees on leave, on leave without pay, or on furlough even 
though an employee's resignation has been accepted, are subject to the 
restrictions. Separated employees who have received a lump-sum payment 
for annual leave are not subject to the restriction during the period 
covered by the lump-sum payment or thereafter, provided they do not 
return to Federal employment during that period. Employees are not 
permitted to take a leave of absence to work with a political candidate, 
committee, or organization or to become a candidate for office with the 
understanding that they will resign their position if nominated or 
elected.
    (e) Employees are accountable for political activity by another 
person acting as their agent or under the employee's direction or 
control, if they are thus accomplishing indirectly what they may not 
lawfully do directly and openly.
    (f) Though officers in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps 
are not subject to the restrictions in Subchapter III of Chapter 73 of 
Title 5, United States Code, the provisions of this subpart apply to 
them.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-602  Permissible activities.

    (a) Section 7324 of Title 5, United States Code, provides that 
employees have the right to vote as they please and to express their 
opinions on political subjects and candidates. Generally, however, 
employees are prohibited from taking an active part in political 
management or political campaigns or using official authority or 
influence to interfere with an election or affect its results. There are 
some exemptions from the restrictions of the statute:
    (1) Employees may engage in political activity in connection with 
any question not specifically identified with a national or State 
political party. They also may engage in political activity in 
connection with an election, if none of the candidates represents a 
party any of whose candidates for presidential elector received votes at 
the last preceding election at which presidential electors were 
selected.
    (2) An exception relates to political campaigns within, or in 
communities adjacent to, the District of Columbia, or in communities the 
majority of whose voters are employees of the Federal government. 
Communities to

[[Page 171]]

which the exception applies are specifically designated by the Office of 
Personnel Management. Information regarding the localities and the 
conditions under which the exceptions are granted may be obtained from 
personnel offices or the Department Counselor or deputy counselors.
    (b) A covered employee is permitted to:
    (1) Register and vote in any election;
    (2) Express his or her opinion as an individual citizen privately 
and publicly on political subjects and candidates;
    (3) Display a political picture, sticker, badge or button;
    (4) Participate in the nonpartisan activities of a civic, community, 
social, labor, or professional organization, or of a similar 
organization;
    (5) Be a member of a political party or other political organization 
and participate in its activities to the extent consistent with law;
    (6) Attend a political convention, rally, fund raising function; or 
other political gathering;
    (7) Sign a political petition as an individual citizen;
    (8) Make a financial contribution to a political party organization;
    (9) Take an active part, as an independent candidate, or support of 
an independent candidate, in a partisan election in localities 
identified as permissible for such activities by the Office of Personnel 
Management;
    (10) Take an active part, as a candidate or in support of a 
candidate, in a nonpartisan election;
    (11) Be politically active in connection with a question which is 
not specifically identified with a political party, such as a 
constitutional amendment, referendum, approval of a municipal ordinance 
or any other question or issue of a similar character;
    (12) Serve as an election judge or clerk, or in a similar position 
to perform nonpartisan duties as prescribed by State or local law; and
    (13) Otherwise participate fully in public affairs, except as 
prohibited by law, in a manner which does not materially compromise his 
or her efficiency or integrity as an employee or the neutrality, 
efficiency, or integrity of his or her agency.
    (c) The head of a principal operating component may prohibit or 
limit the participation of an employee or class of employees of his or 
her component in an activity permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, 
if participation in the activity would interfere with the efficient 
performance of official duties, or create a conflict or apparent 
conflict of interest.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-603  Prohibited activities.

    (a) The following are prohibited activities:
    (1) Serving as an officer of a political party, a member of a 
national, State or local committee of a political party, an officer or 
member of a committee of a partisan political club, or being a candidate 
for any of these positions;
    (2) Organizing or reorganizing a political party organization or 
political club;
    (3) Directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, collecting, 
handling, disbursing, or accounting for assessments, contributions, or

support of or in opposition to a candidate for public office or 
political party office;
    (8) Acting as recorder, watcher, challenger, or similar officer at

opposition to a candidate for public or political party office, or on a 
partisan political question; and
    (13) Initiating or circulating a nominating petition for a candidate 
in a partisan election.
    (b) In addition, certain political activities are prohibited by 
Federal criminal law:
    (1) Officers and employees may not directly or indirectly solicit or 
receive, or be in any way involved in soliciting or receiving, any 
assessment, subscription or contribution for any political purpose 
whatever from another officer or employee. This prohibition extends to 
one who acts as a mere agent or messenger for the purpose of turning the 
contribution over to a political organization. 18 U.S.C. 602.
    (2) All persons, whether employees or not, are prohibited from 
soliciting in any manner, or receiving a contribution of, money or a 
thing of value, in any room or building occupied in the discharge of 
official duties by any officer or employee of the United States. 18 
U.S.C. 603. This prohibition extends to the sending of a letter 
soliciting political contributions for delivery in a Government 
building.
    (3) No officer or employee may directly or indirectly give to any 
other officer, employee or person in the service of the United States, 
any money or other thing of value to be applied to the promotion of any 
political objective. 18 U.S.C. 607.
    (4) Discrimination for giving or withholding any contribution for 
any political purpose and discrimination based on political influence or 
recommendations is prohibited.
    (c) Various other laws prohibit certain activities in connection 
with political campaigns and elections. They include:
    (1) Intimidating, threatening, or coercing voters in Federal 
elections (18 U.S.C. 594).
    (2) Using official authority in interfering with a Federal election 
by a person employed in any administrative position by the United States 
or by any department, independent establishment, or agency of the United

connection with any activity financed in whole or in part by Federal 
funds (18 U.S.C. 595).
    (3) Promising Federal employment, compensation, or any benefit from 
Federal funds, in return for political activity or support (18 U.S.C. 
600).

derived from Federal relief or work relief funds on account of race, 
creed, color, or political activity (18 U.S.C. 601).
    (5) Soliciting, assessing, or receiving subscriptions or 
contributions for political purpose from anyone on Federal relief or 
work relief (18 U.S.C. 604).


<R04>
                      Subpart G--Outside Activities


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-701  General provisions.

    (a) Outside employment may be appropriate when it will not adversely 
affect performance of an employee's official duties and will not reflect 
discredit on the Government or the Department. Such work may include 
civic, charitable, religious, and community undertakings. There are 
certain types of outside work, however, which give rise to a real or 
apparent conflict of interest. Some of these are prohibited by law. 
Others are prohibited by regulation, as discussed in paragraph (b) of 
this section, or by criteria developed by heads of operating components 
for application within a particular component. All of these provisions 
are binding, but they do not necessarily include all possible conflicts 
of interest. In all instances, good judgment must be used to avoid a 
conflict between an employee's Federal responsibilities and outside 
activities.
    (b) An employee shall not engage in outside employment or other 
outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge of 
the duties and responsibilities of his or her Government employment 
whether or not in violation of any specific provision of law. 
Incompatible activities include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or 
any other thing of monetary value in any circumstances in which 
acceptance

[[Page 173]]

may result in, or create the appearance of, conflicts of interest;
    (2) Outside employment which tends to impair the employee's mental 
or physical capacity to perform Government duties and responsibilities 
in an acceptable manner;
    (3) Work which identifies the Department or any employee in his or 
her official capacity with any organization commercializing products 
relating to work conducted by the Department, or with any commercial 
advertising matter, or work performed under such circumstances as to 
give the impression that it is an official act of the Department or 
represents an official point of view;
    (4) Outside work or activity that takes the employee's time and 
attention during his official work hours.
    (c) An employee shall not receive any salary or anything of monetary 
value from a private source as compensation for services to the 
Government. For example, a Department employee may be called upon, as a 
part of his or her official duties, to participate in a professional 
meeting sponsored by a non-Government organization, or to contribute a 
paper or other writing prepared on official time for publication under 
non-Government auspices. The employee must not accept an honorarium or 
fee for such services, even though the organization accepting the 
service customarily makes such a payment to those who participate. Nor 
may the employee accept a contribution to some charity, educational 
institution, or the like, in appreciation of the services furnished by 
the Department employee who cannot accept the usual payment. All offers 
to make such a contribution must be refused. Any employee with whom such 
a question is raised shall explain that the service involved was 
provided as an official action of the Department and is authorized by 
law. Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate for any payment to 
be made, even indirectly and to a third party, for services which are 
furnished without charge by the Government.
    (d) Other than as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
employees may receive compensation or other things of monetary value for 
any lecture, discussion, writing or appearance the subject matter of 
which is in part devoted to the responsibility, programs or operations 
of the Department so long as the activity is undertaken in a personal 
capacity, is not performed as official duty, is not done while on 
official time, and does not create a conflict of interest or appearance 
of conflict of interest. However, such activities are considered outside 
employment and may be undertaken only as provided in this subpart.
    (e) This section does not restrict the acceptance of compensation or 
other things of monetary value for any lecture, discussion, writing or 
appearance, the subject matter of which is not devoted to the 
responsibilities, programs, or operations of the Department and which 
are undertaken in a private capacity and in accordance with Sec.Sec. 
73.735-704, 73.735-705, or 73.735-706.
    (f) Federal law limits the amount of honorarium that may be paid any 
employee for any one speech, writing or appearance to $2,000.00 (not to 
include amounts for actual travel and subsistence expenses for the 
employee and his or her spouse) and an aggregate of $25,000.00 in any 
calendar year. This limitation applies to such activities whether or not 
the subject matter is related to the responsibilities, programs or 
operations of the Department. (2 U.S.C. 441i) The term ``honorarium'' 
means payment of money or other thing of value whether made gratuitously 
or as a fee for an appearance, speech or article but does not include 
salary or compensation made for services rendered on a continuing basis, 
such as for teaching, or as proceeds from the sale of a book or similar 
undertaking.
    (g) An employee who is a Presidential appointee covered by section 
401(a) of Executive Order 11222 shall not receive compensation or 
anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, 
writing or appearance, the subject matter of which is devoted 
substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of his or 
her component, or which draws substantially on official data or ideas 
which have not or will not on request become public information.

[[Page 174]]

    (h) Application of these general provisions to some specific 
activities is discussed below.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-702  Criminal prohibitions on outside activities.

    (a) An employee may not, with or without compensation, represent 
another before any Government agency, court or commission in connection 
with any proceeding, application, request for a ruling, contract, claim 
or other particular matter in which the United States is a party or has 
a direct and substantial interest. (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205)
    (b) An employee may not act as agent or attorney for anyone else in 
prosecuting any claim against the United States (18 U.S.C. 205).
    (c) As an exception to the above, if it is not inconsistent with the 
performance of his or her duties, an employee may act without 
compensation as an agent or attorney for another employee, or a person 
under active consideration for Federal employment, who is the subject of 
disciplinary, loyalty, or other personnel administration proceedings in 
connection with those proceedings at the administrative level. For 
example, an employee may represent another employee who is the subject 
of disciplinary action, or the complainant in a discrimination 
proceeding, at all stages within the Department and before the Merit 
Systems Protection Board or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but 
not in Federal Court. It would be inconsistent with the performance of 
official duties for a supervisor to represent subordinate employees.
    (d) The law and these regulations do not prohibit an employee from 
acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for his or 
her parents, spouse, child or any person for whom, or estate for which, 
he or she is acting as fiduciary provided that the head of the principal 
operating component or his or her designee approve. Such approval, if 
granted, must be granted in accordance with the procedures for approval 
of outside activity. However, the employee may not do so if the 
particular matter is one in which he or she has participated personally 
and substantially or which is his or her official responsibility. (18 
U.S.C. 205).


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-703  Statutory prohibitions related to employment by a foreign 
government.

    Employees, including officers in the Public Health Service (PHS) 
Commissioned Corps and retired officers of the Regular Commissioned 
Corps of the PHS, may not, without the consent of Congress, be employed 
by a foreign government or agency of a foreign government (Art. I, Sec. 
9, U.S. Const.). Congress has consented to such employment by Reserve 
Commissioned Officers of the PHS not on active duty and by Retired 
Regular Commissioned Officers (37 U.S.C. 801, note) if approved under 
regulations of the Department of State. 22 CFR part 3a.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-704  Professional and consultative services.

    (a) Employees may engage in outside professional or consultative 
work only after meeting certain conditions. Except as provided in 
Sec.Sec. 73.735-705 and 73.735-706 for activities discussed in those 
sections, the conditions which must be met are:
    (1) The work is not to be rendered, with or without compensation, to 
organizations, institutions, or state or local governments with which 
the official duties of the employee are directly related, or indirectly 
related if the indirect relationship is significant enough to cause the 
existence of conflict or apparent conflict of interest; or
    (2) The work is not to be rendered for compensation to help a 
person, institution, or government unit prepare or aid in the 
preparation of grant applications, contract proposals, program reports, 
and other material which are designed to become the subject of dealings 
between the institutions or government units and the Federal Government. 
All requests to perform consultative services, either compensated or 
uncompensated, for institutions or government units which have recently 
negotiated or may in the near future seek a contract or grant from this 
Department must be carefully appraised to avoid any conflict or apparent 
conflict of interest.

[[Page 175]]

    (b) Advance administrative approval in accordance with Sec. 73.735-
708 of this subpart must be obtained. Such approval is required whether 
or not the services are for compensation, and whether or not related to 
the employee's official duties.
    (c) For the purpose of this section, ``professional and consultative 
work'' is performance of work requiring knowledge of an advanced type in 
a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of 
specialized instruction and study in an institution of higher education, 
or hospital which requires the exercise of judgment and discretion in 
its performance and is primarily intellectual in nature as opposed to 
manual, mechanical or physical work.
    (d) Membership on a Board of Directors, Board of Regents, Board of 
Trustees, Planning Commission, Advisory Council or Committee, or on any 
similar body which provides advice, counsel, or consultation, shall be 
considered outside consultative services for which advance 
administrative approval is required.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-705  Writing and editing.

    (a) Employees are encouraged to engage in outside writing and 
editing whether or not done for compensation, when such activity is not 
otherwise prohibited. Such writing and editing, though not a part of 
official duties, may be on a directly related subject or entirely 
unrelated. Certain conditions must be met in either case, however, and 
certain clearances or approvals are prescribed according to the content 
of the material as set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this 
section.
    (b) Conditions applying to writing and editing done not as a part of 
official duties.
    (1) The following conditions shall apply to all writing and editing 
whether related or unrelated to the employee's official duties:
    (i) Government-financed time or supplies shall not be used by the 
author or by other Government employees in connection with the activity; 
and
    (ii) Official support must not be expressed or implied in the 
material itself or advertising or promotional material, including book 
jackets and covers, relating to the employee and his or her contribution 
to the publication.
    (2) If the writing or editing activity is unrelated to the 
employee's official duties or other responsibilities and programs of the 
Federal government, the employee must:
    (i) Make no mention of his or her official title or affiliation with 
the Department, or
    (ii) Use his or her official title or affiliation with the 
Department in a way that will not suggest or convey official endorsement 
of the work.
    (3) If the writing or editing activity is related to the employee's 
official duties or other responsibilities and programs of the Federal 
government, the employee must:
    (i) Make no mention of his or her official title or affiliation with 
the Department, or
    (ii) Use his or her official title or affiliation with the 
Department and a disclaimer as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, or
    (iii) Submit the material for clearance within the operating 
component, under procedures established by the component. When clearance 
is denied at any lower level, the employee shall have recourse for 
review up to the head of the principal operating component. This 
clearance will show there are no official objections to the activity and 
the employee may then use his or her official title or affiliation with 
the Department usually without a disclaimer.
    (c) Disclaimers. (1) Except where the requirement for disclaimer is 
waived as a result of official clearance, disclaimers shall be used in 
all writing and editing related to the employee's official duties or 
other responsibilities and programs of the Federal government:
    (i) In which the employee identifies himself or herself by official 
title or affiliation with the Department, or
    (ii) When the prominence of the employee or the employee's position 
might lead the public to associate him or her with the Department, even 
without identification other than name.
    (2) Disclaimers shall read as follows unless a different wording is 
approved by the Assistant General Counsel,

[[Page 176]]

Business and Administrative Law Division, Office of the General Counsel: 
``This (article, book, etc.) was (written, edited) by (employee's name) 
in (his or her) private capacity. No official suport or endorsement by 
(name of operating component or of Department) is intended or should be 
inferred.''
    (d) Advance approval. Advance approval is required in accordance 
with Sec. 73.735-708 of this subpart when one or more of the following 
conditions apply:
    (1) Any Government information is used which is not available on 
request to persons outside the Government;
    (2) Material is written or edited which pertains to subject matter 
directly related to an employee's official duties; (This includes 
editing for scientific or professional journals which is related to his 
or her official duties.)
    (3) Material is written or edited which pertains to any Government-
sponsored research or other studies for which clinical case records or 
other material of a confidential nature are used or to which access is 
limited for persons outside the Government. Such use will not be 
permitted unless made under safeguards established by the operating 
component to retain the confidentiality of the material, and such use is 
determined to be in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-706  Teaching, lecturing, and speechmaking.

    (a) Employees are encouraged to engage in teaching and lecturing 
activities which are not part of their official duties when certain 
conditions are met. These conditions, which apply to outside teaching 
and lecturing (including giving single addresses such as commencement 
and Memorial Day speeches) whether or not done for compensation, are:
    (1) No Government-financed time, or Government supplies not 
otherwise available to the public, are used in connection with such 
activity;
    (2) Government travel or per diem funds are not used for the sole 
purpose of obtaining or performing such teaching or lecturing;
    (3) Such teaching or lecturing is not dependent on specific 
information which would not otherwise be available to the public;
    (4) Teaching, lecturing, or writing may not be for the purpose of 
the special preparation of a person or class of persons for an 
examination of the Office of Personnel Management or Board of Examiners 
for the Foreign Service, that depends on information obtained as a 
result of the employee's Government employment, except when that 
information has been made available to the general public or will be 
made available on request;
    (5) Such activities do not involve knowingly instructing persons on 
dealing with particular matters pending before Government organizations 
with which the employee is associated in an official capacity;
    (6) Advance approval is obtained when required by paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Advance approval. Advance approval must be obtained in 
accordance with Sec. 73.735-708 of this subpart before an employee may:
    (1) Teach or lecture for an institution which has or is likely to 
have official dealings with the bureau or comparable organizational unit 
in which he or she is employed;
    (2) Use, for teaching or lecturing purposes, clinical case records 
or other material of a confidential nature or to which access is limited 
for persons outside the Government. Such use will not be permitted 
unless made under safeguards established by the operating component to 
retain the confidentiality of the material, and such use is determined 
to be in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-707  Holding office in professional societies.

    (a) Employees may be members of professional societies and be 
elected or appointed to office in such a society. Activity in 
professional associations is generally desirable from the point of view 
of both the Department and the employee. Employees shall avoid, however, 
any real or apparent conflict of interest in connection with such 
membership. For example, they must not:
    (1) Directly or indirectly commit the Department or any portion of 
it on any matter unless such action is taken in an official capacity;
    (2) Permit their names to be attached to documents the distribution 
of which

[[Page 177]]

would be likely to embarrass the Department; or
    (3) Serve in capacities involving them as representatives of non-
Government organizations in dealing with the Government.
    (b) In undertaking any office or function beyond ordinary membership 
in a professional association, a Department employee must obtain advance 
approval in accordance with Sec. 73.735-708 of this subpart in any 
situation in which his or her responsibilities as an officer would 
relate to his or her official duties or would create a real or apparent 
conflict of interest with responsibilities as a Department employee. For 
example, advance administrative approval must be obtained:
    (1) Before an employee who is responsible for review and approval of 
grants or contracts, or is in a supervisory position over those who 
conduct review and approval, may hold office, or be a trustee or member 
of the governing board, or the chairman or member of a committee, in any 
organization which has or is seeking a grant or contract with the bureau 
or comparable organizational unit in which he or she is employed;
    (2) Before an employee may hold office in an organization which 
customarily expresses publicly views on matters of legislative or 
administrative policy within the specific areas of concern to the 
Department.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-708  Administrative approval of certain outside activities.

    (a) Scope. As specified in Sec. 73.735-704 through 707, an employee 
is required to obtain advance administrative approval to engage in the 
following outside activities:
    (1) Certain writing or editing activities;
    (2) Certain types of teaching and lecturing;
    (3) All professional and consultative services;
    (4) Any other outside activity for which the head of a principal 
operating component or the head of a sub-unit of a principal operating 
component imposes internal requirements for administrative approval; and
    (5) Certain office-holding activities in professional societies.
    (b) Requests for Administrative Approval. An employee seeking to 
engage in any of the activities for which advance approval is required 
shall make a written request for administrative approval a reasonable 
time before beginning the activity. (See Sec. 73.735-202(e)(1)). This 
request should be directed to the employee's supervisor who will forward 
it to the official authorized to approve outside work requests for the 
employee's component. The request should include the following 
information:
    (1) Employee's name, position title, grade or rank;
    (2) Nature of the activity, fully describing the specific duties or 
services for which approval is requested;
    (3) Name and business of person or organization for which work will 
be done, or statement that work will be self-employment. If self-
employment, employee must state whether activity will be conducted alone 
or with partners;
    (4) Place where work will be performed;
    (5) Estimated total time to be devoted to activity. If on a 
continuing basis, indicate estimated time per year and the anticipated 
termination date;
    (6) Whether services can be performed entirely outside of usual duty 
hours. If not, the estimated number of hours absent from work should be 
indicated;
    (7) Method or basis of compensation if any (e.g., fee, per diem, per 
annum, or other).
    (8) Where an employee seeks approval to provide consultative or 
professional services to organizations including governments which have 
been awarded or may apply for a Federal grant or contract, the request 
shall also include full details on any aspect of the professional and 
consultative services which could relate in any way, either directly or 
indirectly, to grant applications, contract proposals, program reports, 
and other material which are designed to become the subject of dealings 
between the grantee or contractor and the Government. (See Sec. 73.735-
704(a)(2))
    (c) The Department Ethics Counselor will review and approve outside 
work requests for Executive level officers, non-career executives, 
deputy ethics

[[Page 178]]

counselors, and Schedule C employees in the Office of the Secretary.
    (d) Granting Approval of Certain Activities. The approving official 
shall review each request submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, 
and appraise each request on the basis of the standards of this part and 
all other applicable laws, regulations or internal rules of the 
principal operating component or sub-unit thereof. He or she should 
consult with a deputy ethics counselor or the Department Ethics 
Counselor in all cases that raise a difficult or novel question of law 
or fact. The approving official shall approve or disapprove each request 
and communicate his or her decision in writing to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-709  Annual reporting of outside activities.

    By September 10 of each year the approving official shall require a 
report from each person for whom outside work has been approved during 
the past year. The report shall show:
    (a) For the 12 months just past (ending August 31):
    (1) Whether the anticipated work was actually performed for the 
person or organization named in the request for approval;
    (2) Actual amount of time spent on the activity.
    (b) For the forthcoming 12 months (ending August 31):
    (1) Whether it is anticipated that the outside work will continue;
    (2) Whether any change is anticipated with respect to information 
supplied in accordance with the original request on which approval was 
based.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-710  Maintenance of records.

    The official responsible for the administrative aspects of these 
regulations (Sec. 73.735-202) shall make provisions for the retention 
and filing of requests for approval of outside work (or copies of such 
requests), a copy of the notification of approval or disapproval, and 
the annual report.


<R04>
                      Subpart H--Financial Interest


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-801  Participation in matters affecting a personal financial 
interest.

    (a) An employee shall not participate personally and substantially 
as a Government employee in a matter in which any of the following 
individuals or organizations has a financial interest:
    (1) The employee;
    (2) The employee's spouse;
    (3) The employee's minor child;
    (4) An organization in which the employee serves as an officer, 
director, trustee, partner, or employee; or
    (5) A person or organization with which the employee is negotiating 
for prospective employment or has an arrangement for prospective 
employment. Criminal penalties may be imposed under 18 U.S.C. 208 for 
violations of the prohibition.
    (b) Applying the provision of 18 U.S.C. 208:
    (1) A ``financial interest'' is any interest of monetary value which 
may be directly and predictably affected by the official action of an 
employee. There is no minimum amount of value or control that 
constitutes a financial interest.

    Example 1: An employee owns a single share of stock in a widely-held 
corporation. If the corporation is likely to be affected by a matter in 
which the employee participates as a Government official, the employee 
may violate 18 U.S.C. 208.
    Example 2: An employee has a paid part-time position with a non-
federal organization. If the organization is likely to be affected by a 
matter in which the employee participates as a Government official, the 
employee would violate 18 U.S.C. 208.

    (2) The prohibition of 18 U.S.C. 208 applies to personal and 
substantial involvement by an employee in a matter, exercised through 
decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, investigation, giving 
advice, or other significant effort regarding the matter.

    Example 1: An employee is a member of a panel that evaluates 
proposals for contracts and makes recommendations as to their award. If 
the employee's spouse owns stock in a company which submits a proposal 
that

[[Page 179]]

is reviewed by the panel, the employee would violate 18 U.S.C. 208 even 
though the panel recommendation may be rejected by the contracting 
officer.
    Example 2: An employee is on a leave of absence from a university. 
He or she would violate 18 U.S.C. 208 by participating in the drafting 
of regulations which would have a ``direct and predictable effect'' upon 
universities in general and, therefore, upon the employee's university.

    (3) An employee must know that the financial interest exists in 
order to violate 18 U.S.C. 208.

    Example: An employee inherited a beneficial interest in a trust. He 
or she does not, however, have actual knowledge of the specific property 
held by the trustee. If the trust contains stock in a corporation which 
may be affected by the employee's official actions, he or she would not 
violate 18 U.S.C. 208 in taking official action affecting the 
corporation.

    (4) Negotiation for prospective employment includes both an 
indication of interest on the part of the employee in working for an 
organization and an affirmative action on the part of the organization 
to show consideration of the employee.

    Example 1: An employee of the Department sends resumes and cover 
letters to fifty prospective employers, all of whom regularly have 
dealings with HHS. Forty employers do not respond; however, ten respond 
with cordial form letters stating that the employee's resume will be 
retained for future reference. For purposes of the 18 U.S.C. 208 
prohibition, the employee is negotiating for prospective employment at 
the time he or she sends resumes.
    Example 2: At a site visit to a grantee institution, an employee who 
is officially responsible for a grant to that institution informs an 
officer of the institution that he or she is seeking a new position 
outside HHS. The grantee subsequently makes a conditional offer of 
employment to the employee who promptly responds by asking for an 
opportunity to discuss salary and related matters. Under these 
circumstances, a negotiation for prospective employment is underway.

    (c) An employee may obtain approval to participate in his or her 
official capacity in a matter in which he or she has a direct or 
indirect financial interest, if the interest is not so substantial as to 
affect the integrity of his or her official duties. An employee who 
believes that such participation is warranted should follow the 
procedures in Sec. 73.735-804.
    (d) An employee convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. 208 may be fined up 
to $10,000, or imprisoned up to two years, or both.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-802  Executive order prohibitions.

    (a) Basic prohibition of Executive Order 11222. (1) An employee 
shall not have a direct or indirect financial interest that conflicts 
substantially, or appears to conflict substantially, with his or her 
duties as a Federal employee.
    (2) An employee need not have a financial interest that actually 
conflicts with his or her duties to violate the prohibition of E.O. 
11222. Any financial interest that could reasonably be viewed as an 
interest which might compromise the employee's integrity, whether or not 
this is in fact true, is subject to this prohibition.
    (3) Except as provided in Sec. 73.735-802 (b) and (c), an employee 
who has an indirect financial interest in a business entity through the 
ownership of shares in a widely-held mutual fund or other regulated 
investment company will not violate E.O. 11222. Stocks in business 
entities held by an intermediary such as a mutual fund are generally too 
remote or inconsequential to affect the integrity of an employee's 
services.
    (b) Employees in regulatory activities. (1) An employee who is 
working in a regulatory activity shall not have a financial interest in 
any company whose business activities are subject to the regulations of 
the particular activity with which the employee is associated, unless 
the regulated activities of the company are an insignificant part of its 
total business operations.
    (2) An employee working in a regulatory activity may not hold shares 
in a mutual fund or other regulated investment company which specializes 
in holdings in industries that are regulated by the particular activity 
in which he or she is employed.

    Example: An employee working for the Bureau of Laboratories, Centers 
for Disease Control, may not hold shares in a regulated investment 
company which specializes in holdings that include medical testing 
laboratories.


[[Page 180]]


    (c) Employees having procurement or contracting responsibilities.
    (1) An employee who serves as a procurement or contracting officer 
shall not have a financial interest in a company or companies with which 
he or she in the course of his or her official duties would be likely to 
have procurement or contracting relationships.
    (2) A procurement or contracting officer may not hold shares in a 
mutual fund or other regulated investment company that specializes in 
holdings in industries with which such officer would be likely to have 
procurement or contracting relationships.

    Example: A contracting officer in the Social Security Administration 
owns shares in the XYZ Mutual Fund which specializes in stock in firms 
manufacturing electronic data processing equipment. Ownership of XYZ 
Mutual Fund shares would be prohibited in this instance. On the other 
hand, a contracting officer for a Public Health Service hospital, who is 
not likely to have responsibility for major contracts relating to 
electronic data processing, could hold such shares.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-803  Prohibition against involvement in financial transactions 
based on information obtained through Federal employment.

    An employee shall not engage in, directly or indirectly, a financial 
transaction as a result of, or in primary reliance upon, any information 
gained through his or her official duties. Information gained through 
official duties are those facts and other data that relate to the 
employee's official duties or to the functions of the employing 
component and would not be available to the employee were he or she not 
an officer of the Federal government.

    Example 1: An employee working part-time for a consulting firm that 
does no business with the employee's principal operating component, in 
the area of health care planning advises it, based upon his or her 
knowledge of a new health care planning program about to be initiated by 
the Public Health Service. The employee's knowledge of the program was 
acquired solely through reading policy statements and other PHS 
literature available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. 
In such case, the employee would not violate this regulation if the 
outside activity was otherwise approvable under Subpart G.
    Example 2: A contracting officer with detailed knowledge of a 
negotiated procurement contract invests in a corporation that is likely 
to indirectly profit from the award of that contract. The officer's 
decision to invest is based upon technical details of the successful 
contract proposal that would not otherwise be available to a private 
citizen. The officer would violate this regulation in such a situation.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-804  Waiver of the prohibitions in this subpart.

    (a) An employee may request approval to participate in his or her 
official capacity in a matter in which he or she has a direct or 
indirect financial interest if the employee believes the interest is so 
remote and inconsequential that it would not affect the integrity of his 
or her official duties. Also an employee who has a financial interest 
that would otherwise be prohibited under these regulations may request 
an exemption from the prohibition for the reason stated in the preceding 
sentence.
    (b) The request shall be in writing and shall include the following 
information:
    (1) Employee's name, occupational title, grade or rank and Federal 
salary;
    (2) Full description of financial interest: including whether 
ownership, service as officer, partner, etc.;
    (3) Business or activity in which financial interest exists;
    (4) Description of official matter in which employee is requesting 
approval to participate;
    (5) Basis for requesting determination that the interest is ``not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect.'' (If based on a small total 
value of investment, supply appropriate information on total value, such 
as total shares held and latest quoted market price. If other basis, 
explain fully.)

The request should be sent through usual administrative channels to the 
official responsible for reviewing financial disclosure reports or 
statements for the employee's organization (Subpart I). That official, 
after conferring with a deputy ethics counselor or with the Department 
Ethics Counselor as appropriate, will make a decision about the 
exemption or exception and inform the employee in writing.

[[Page 181]]


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-805  Advice and guidance on conflicts matters.

    (a) Whenever an employee has a question about the appropriate course 
of conduct to be followed in a matter that may involve an actual or 
apparent conflict of interest, he or she should immediately consult with 
his or her supervisor or a deputy ethics counselor, or both. If a 
supervisor who is consulted determines that the matter warrants further 
consideration, he or she may, in conjunction with the employee, submit 
the details of the matter, in writing, to the appropriate deputy ethics 
counselor. These details should include a description of:
    (1) The activity, relationship, or interest giving rise to the 
question posed by the employee;
    (2) The duties or official responsibilities of the employee(s) 
involved;
    (3) The nature of the actual or apparent conflict of interest; and
    (4) Any other information that may be helpful in reviewing the 
problem.
    (b) Upon receiving the submission of an employee or a supervisor, 
the deputy ethics counselor will develop any additional information 
about the matter as necessary, and will confer with the Department 
Ethics Counselor as appropriate. The Department Ethics Counselor and the 
head of the principal operating component or his or her designee will be 
informed of any serious violation of the standards of this subpart or 
any other conflict of interest law. Questions of first impression or 
other unusual matters shall be brought to the attention of the 
Department Ethics Counselor and the head of the principal operating 
component or his or her designee.
    (c) On the basis of all information gathered including, where 
appropriate, the advice of the Department Ethics Counselor, the deputy 
ethics counselor will:
    (1) Decide that there is no violation or potential violation of the 
standards of this subpart or any other law and so notify the employee 
and his or her supervisor in writing; or
    (2) Decide that a violation or potential violation of the standards 
of this subpart or other law has occurred or may occur, and that the 
employee involved shall take one or more of the steps set forth in Sec. 
731.735-904 to resolve the problem and notify the employee and his or 
her supervisor in writing; or
    (3) Decide that, although no violation of this subpart or other law 
has occurred, the nature of the matter is such that the employee should 
periodically report any additional information that would require 
reconsideration of the initial submission.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-806  Documentation and publication of opinions.

    (a) The Department Ethics Counselor, deputy ethics counselors, and 
any other individuals required to be involved in the review and 
resolution of violations or potential violations of this subpart shall 
maintain full and accurate documentation of the formal advice and 
guidance given.
    (b) From time to time, the Department Ethics Counselor shall publish 
summaries of advisory opinions issued by his or her office, deleting, as 
necessary, any personal identifiers or other information which may give 
rise to an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. These summaries 
shall be distributed to all deputy ethics counselors, heads of principal 
operating components, and principal regional officials.
    (c) From time to time, the Department Ethics Counselor shall publish 
an index of all summaries issued in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, and shall distribute these indexes to all deputy ethics 
counselors and heads of principal operating components who shall in turn 
make them available for review by supervisors and interested employees.


<R04>

the Government and to avoid possible conflicts of interest. The 
designation of any such positions below the GS-13 grade must be approved 
by the Office of Personnel Management.
    (3) All experts, consultants, or advisory committee members who are 
not required to submit a public financial disclosure report in 
accordance with the Ethics in Government Act except:
    (i) Doctors, dentists and allied medical specialists performing 
services for, or consulted as to the diagnosis or treatment of, 
individual patients; or
    (ii) Veterinarians performing services for or consulted as to care 
and service to animals.
    (b) Filing dates. (1) Experts, consultants, and advisory committee 
members shall file a confidential Statement of Employment and Financial 
Interest no later than the date employment commences and shall file 
supplemental statements as necessary to keep all information submitted 
current and accurate.
    (2) Other individuals covered by Sec. 73.735-902 (a) of this subpart 
shall:
    (i) File a confidential statement no later than 30 days after 
assuming a covered position unless the employee, within 30 days before 
assuming the position, left another covered position in HHS that is 
included in Sec. 73.735-901(a) or Sec. 73.735-902(a) of this subpart; 
and
    (ii) Report changes in or additions to the information in the 
statement as of June 30 of each calendar year, or a different date set 
by employee's component with authorization by the Office of Personnel 
Management.
    (c) Submission and review of financial statements. (1) Heads of 
principal operating components, the Assistant Secretary for Management 
and Budget, and principal regional officials for employees under their 
appointing authority shall establish procedures to ensure that financial 
statements from covered employees are received and updated on a timely 
basis and are referred to the appropriate reviewing officials for review 
and certification. (See Sec. 73.735-202 (e)(1)).
    (2) The reviewing official shall review statements to determine 
whether conflicts of interest or apparent conflicts might arise from the 
activities reported thereon. If the review discloses no conflict or 
apparent conflict, the reviewing official shall certify the statement 
with his or her signature. Action to take if the individual is not in 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations is discussed in Sec. 
73.735-903 and Sec. 73.735-904.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-903  Action if conflicts of interest or possible conflicts are 
noted.

    (a) If after reviewing a financial disclosure report or a financial 
interest statement, a reviewing official believes that additional 
information is needed, he or she shall tell the individual submitting 
such report what additional information is required and the time by 
which it must be submitted.
    (b) If the reviewing official is of the opinion that, on the basis 
of information submitted, the reporting individual is not in compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations, he or she shall notify the 
individual, afford him or her a reasonable opportunity for a written or 
oral response, and after consideration of such response, determine 
whether or not the individual is in compliance.
    (c) If the reviewing official determines that an individual is not 
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, he or she shall 
notify the individual of that determination in writing and, after an 
opportunity for personal consultation, determine and notify the 
individual of the action, including those actions set forth in Sec. 
73.735-904, that would be appropriate to assure compliance with such 
laws and regulations, and the date by which such action should be taken. 
The action required and the date for taking it shall be determined by 
the nature of the financial interest or other relationship,

[[Page 184]]

the particular circumstances of the reporting individual (including his 
or her ability to resolve the problem), and other factors which the 
reviewing official deems relevant. In no case, however, should the date 
be later than 90 days after the reporting individual is notified of the 
reviewing official's opinion.
    (d) If steps for assuring compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations are not taken by the date set in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the matter shall be referred to the Department Ethics 
Counselor.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-904  Resolution of apparent or actual conflicts of interest.

    (a) Disqualification from participating in a particular matter or 
category of matters is an appropriate method for resolving apparent or 
actual conflicts of interest when the interest or activity giving rise 
to the problem:
    (1) Bears a direct or indirect relationship to particular, 
identifiable duties of the employee involved; and
    (2) Is not so substantial as to affect or give the appearance of 
affecting the integrity of the services which the Government may expect 
of the employee. Whenever disqualification is employed to resolve an 
apparent or actual conflict of interest, the disqualified employee shall 
sign a written statement reflecting the scope of the disqualification 
and the precise nature of the conflicting interest or activity. The 
reviewing official shall keep a file of all such disqualification 
statements and shall monitor compliance with these statements on a 
regular basis.
    (b) Change of assignment is an appropriate method for resolving 
apparent or actual conflicts of interest when the interest giving rise 
to the problem bears a direct or indirect relationship to particular, 
identifiable duties of the employee involved, and those duties 
constitute a significant portion of the employee's position.
    (c) Waiver under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) is an appropriate method for 
resolving apparent or actual conflicts of interest when:
    (1) The employee seeking the waiver reported the financial interest 
that bears some relationship to his or her official duties, and the 
reviewing official, in consultation with a deputy ethics counselor or 
the Department Ethics Counselor, determines that the financial interest 
is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of 
the services which the Government may expect from such employee; or
    (2) By general rule or regulation published in the Federal Register, 
the Department has exempted the financial interest from the requirements 
of 18 U.S.C. 208 and this part as being too remote or too 
inconsequential to affect the integrity of the Government officers' 
service.
    (d) A trust containing a financial interest which may give rise to 
an apparent or actual conflict of interest is an appropriate method of 
resolving such conflicts when:
    (1) The trust is qualified under section 202(f) of the Ethics in 
Government Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-521), as amended, and subject to the 
regulations of the Office of Government Ethics; or
    (2) In the opinion of the Department's Ethics Counselor, it is 
sufficiently independent of the employee involved so that the integrity 
of the employee's services to the Government are not compromised.
    (e) Divestiture is an appropriate method for resolving actual 
conflicts of interest when the nature of the financial interest is such 
that the conflict of interest cannot be adequately resolved by any of 
the methods set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section.
    (f) Terminating an appointment as a method for resolving an actual 
conflict of interest should be used only when it is clear that no other 
remedy can be found which would be acceptable to both the Department and 
the employee. Generally, this method will be employed only in the most 
extreme cases. Such a termination would be subject to adverse action.


<R04>
  Subpart J--Provisions Relating to Experts, Consultants and Advisory 
                            Committee Members


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1001  Coverage.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart the title ``consultant'' will be 
used to include those who are appointed to serve

[[Page 185]]

as experts, consultants or members of advisory committees. All persons 
who serve as an employee of the Government in the capacity of a 
consultant are covered by the provisions of this subpart irrespective 
of:
    (1) The title by which designated;
    (2) The statutory authority under which services are obtained;
    (3) The duration of the period for which services are obtained;
    (4) Whether services are obtained by appointment or invitation and 
acceptance;
    (5) Whether services are compensated or rendered without 
compensation;
    (6) Whether or not services are obtained pursuant to a statute 
excepting employees or special Government employees from conflict of 
interest statutes.
    (b) When the service is for less than 130 days in a service year, 
experts, consultants, and advisory committee members are included in the 
group of employees designated by law (18 U.S.C. 202) as ``Special 
Government employees.''


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1002  Ethical standards of conduct.

    (a) Like other Federal employees, an individual serving in a 
consultant capacity must conduct himself or herself according to ethical 
behavior standards of the highest order. In particular, such an 
individual must:
    (1) Refrain from any use of office which is, or appears to be, 
motivated by a private gain for himself or herself or other persons, 
particularly those with whom he or she has family, business, or 
financial ties. The fact that desired gain, if it materializes, will not 
take place at the expense of the Government makes his or her actions no 
less improper.
    (2) Conduct himself or herself in a manner devoid of any suggestion 
that he or she is exploiting Government employment for private 
advantage. A consultant must not, on the basis of any inside 
information, enter into any speculation or recommend speculation to 
members of his or her family or business associates, in commodities, 
land, or the securities of any private company. This injunction applies 
even though the consultant's duties have no connection whatever with the 
Government programs or activities which may affect the value of such 
commodities, land, or securities. He or she should be careful in all 
personal financial activities to avoid any appearance of acting on the 
basis of information obtained in the course of his or her Government 
work.
    (3) Refrain from using information not generally available to those 
outside the Government for the special benefit of a business or other 
entity by which the consultant is employed or retained or in which he or 
she has a financial interest. Information not available to private 
industry should remain confidential in the consultant's hands and not be 
divulged to his or her private employer or clients. In cases of doubt 
whether information is generally available to the public, the consultant 
should confer with the person for whom he or she provides services, with 
the office having functional responsibility for a specific type of 
information, or, as appropriate, with the officials designated in Sec. 
73.735-202 to give interpretive and advisory service.
    (4) Where requested by a private enterprise to act for it in a 
consultant or advisory capacity and the request appears motivated by the 
desire for inside information, make a choice between acceptance of the 
tendered private employment and continuation of his or her Government 
consultancy. He or she may not engage in both.
    (5) Not use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the 
appearance of coercing, anyone to provide a financial benefit to him or 
her or another person, particularly one with whom the consultant has 
family, business, or financial ties.
    (6) Not receive or solicit anything of value as a gift, gratuity, 
loan, entertainment, or favor for himself or herself or another person, 
particularly one with whom he or she has family, business, or financial 
ties if the acceptance would result in loss of complete independence or 
impartiality in serving the Government. All consultants are subject to 
the restrictions in Sec. 73.735-506 of this part concerning gifts and 
decorations from foreign governments.
    (b) Consultants may engage in other employment so long as there is 
no real

[[Page 186]]

or apparent conflict between the consultant's private employment and his 
or her official duties. See Sec. 73.735 Subpart G. The regular 
employment of a consultant who is a special Government employee is not 
considered outside work for purposes of Subpart G. Also, the limitation 
in Sec. 73.735-701(f) regarding the amount of an honorarium that may be 
received does not apply to special Government employees.
    (c) A consultant who has questions about conflicts of interest or 
the application of the regulations in this part to him or her or to his 
or her assigned work should make inquiry of the person for whom services 
are provided. That person may direct the consultant to the Department 
Ethics Counselor or a deputy ethics counselor for interpretative and 
advisory services as provided in Sec. 73.735-202.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1003  Conflicts of interest statutes.

    (a) Each consultant should acquaint himself or herself with sections 
203, 205, 207 and 208 of title 18, United States Code, all of which 
carry criminal penalties related to conflicts of interest. The 
restraints imposed by the four criminal sections are summarized in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) 18 U.S.C. 203 and 205.
    (1) These two sections in general operate to preclude a person who 
works for the Government, except in the discharge of his or her official 
duties, from representing anyone else before a court or Government 
agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct 
and substantial interest. The prohibition applies whether or not 
compensation is received for the representation. However, if the 
individual is a special Government employee, this restriction applies 
only if:
    (i) The representation involves a matter in which the individual has 
at any time participated personally and substantially in the course of 
his or her Government employment; or
    (ii) The individual has served the Department for more than 60 days 
in the immediately preceding period of 365 days, and the matter is one 
which is pending before the Department. This second restraint applies 
whether or not the matter is one in which the individual participated 
personally and substantially in his or her Government employment. These 
two provisions apply to a special Government employee on days when he or 
she does not serve the Government as well as on the days when services 
are rendered, and they apply to both paid and unpaid representation.
    (2) To a considerable extent the prohibitions of sections 203 and 
205 are aimed at the sale of influence to gain special favors for 
private businesses and other organizations and at the misuse of 
governmental position or information. In accordance with these aims, a 
consultant, even when not compelled to do so by sections 203 and 205, 
should make every effort in his or her private work to avoid any 
personal contact with respect to negotiations for contracts or grants 
with the component of the department in which he or she is serving, if 
the subject matter is related to the subject matter of his or her 
consultancy or other service. This will not always be possible to 
achieve where, for example, a consultant has an executive position with 
his or her regular employer which requires him or her to participate 
personally in contract negotiations with the department or agency he or 
she is advising. Whenever this is the case, the consultant should 
participate in the negotiations for his or her employer only after 
advising the responsible Government official of his or her involvement 
in other matters in the Department. In other instances an occasional 
consultant may have technical knowledge which is indispensable to his or 
her regular employer in his efforts to formulate a research and 
development contract or a research grant, and for the same reason, it is 
in the interest of the Government that the consultant should take part 
in negotiations for his or her private employer. Again, the individual 
should participate only after advising the responsible Government 
official of the relevant facts.
    (3) Section 205 permits both the Government and the private employer 
of a special Government employee to benefit, in certain cases, from his 
or her performance of work under a grant or

[[Page 187]]

contract for which he or she would otherwise be disqualified because of 
having participated in the matter for the Government or because it is 
pending in a component in which the consultant had served more than 60 
days in the past year. This provision gives the head of a department the 
authority, notwithstanding any prohibition in either section 203 or 205, 
to allow a special Government employee to represent before such 
department or agency either his or her regular employer or another 
person or organization in the performance of work under a grant or 
contract. As a basis for this action, the Secretary must first make a 
certification in writing, published in the Federal Register, that it is 
required by the national interest.
    (4) Section 205 contains two other exemptive provisions, which apply 
to both special and regular Government employees. See Sec. 73.735-702.
    (c) 18 U.S.C. 207 applies to individuals who have left Government 
service. See Subpart N of these regulations.
    (d) 18 U.S.C. 208 bears on the activities of Government personnel, 
including special Government employees, in the course of their official 
duties. In general, it prevents a Government employee from participating 
as such in a particular matter in which, to his or her knowledge, he or 
she, his or her spouse, minor child, partner, or a profit or non-profit 
enterprise with which he or she is connected has a financial interest. 
However, the section permits an employee's agency to grant him or her an 
ad hoc exemption if the interest is not so substantial as to affect the 
integrity of his or her services. Insignificant interests may also be 
waived by a general rule or regulation. The matters in which special 
Government employees are disqualified by section 208 are not limited to 
those involving a specific party or parties in which the United States 
is a party or has an interest, as in the case of sections 203, 205 and 
207. Section 208 therefore extends to matters in addition to contracts, 
grants, judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings, and other matters of an 
adversary nature. Accordingly, a special Government employee, like all 
government employees, should in general be disqualified from 
participating as such in a matter of any type the outcome of which will 
have a direct and predictable effect upon the financial interests 
covered by the section.

However, the power of exemption may be exercised in this situation if 
the special Government employee renders advice of a general nature from 
which no preference or advantage over others might be gained by any 
particular person or organization. The power of exemption may also be 
exercised where the financial interests involved are minimal in value.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1004  Requesting waivers or exemptions.

    (a) A consultant may present in writing to the official for whom he 
or she provides services requests for the waivers or exemptions 
specified in Sec. 73.735-1003. That official will take, or refer the 
request for, action as appropriate, and will see that the employee 
receives advice or decision on his or her request.
    (b) A file of all waivers or exemptions granted shall be maintained 
in such manner that information can be given promptly on individual 
cases or statistics provided upon request. Generally, these records, 
together with written advice given in connection with less formal 
requests concerning questions of ethical standards, are kept with the 
employee's statement of employment and financial interests or financial 
disclosure report (Sec. 73.735-1006).
    (c)(1) Waiver for reviewers from certain multi-campus institutions. 
Applicability of the prohibitions of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and this subpart 
are hereby waived pursuant to a determination that the interest involved 
is too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of a 
special Government employee's review of a funding application or 
contract proposal from one campus of one of the following multi-campus 
institutions, where the interest consists solely of employment as a 
faculty member (including Department Chairman) at a separate campus of 
the same multi-campus institution:

    The University of Alabama system consisting of the University of 
Alabama, the University of Alabama in Birmingham, and the University of 
Alabama in Huntsville.

    The campuses of the University of California.
    The system consisting of Colorado State University, the University 
of Southern Colorado, and Fort Lewis College.

contract proposal from another of the named institutions within that 
State:

    The University of Alabama System and other Alabama State owned

<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1005  Salary from two sources.

    Special Government employees are not subject to 18 U.S.C. 209 which 
prohibits other employees from receiving any salary, or supplementation 
of Government salary, from a private source as a compensation for 
services to the

[[Page 189]]

Government. This Department will not knowingly pay per diem to a 
consultant who also receives per diem pay for the same day from another 
Government agency (in or outside the Department). Erroneous payments in 
contravention of this provision will be subject to collection, and any 
consultant who willfully collects double payments may be barred from 
further employment.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1006  Reporting financial interests.

    (a) Consultants who will work more than 60 days in a calendar year 
are subject to the provisions of title II of the Ethics in Government 
Act of 1978 when their rate of pay is equal to or greater than the basic 
rate for GS-16, Step 1. Such consultants are covered by the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 73.735-901 of these regulations.
    (b) Consultants not subject to the Ethics in Government Act shall 
file statements of financial interests as provided by Sec. 73.735-902 of

    Consultants who serve intermittently are subject to the political 
activity restrictions of Subchapter III of Chapter 73 of Title 5 U.S.C. 
and Civil Service Rule IV only on days on which service is rendered and 
then for the entire 24 hours of such service day. Other consultants are 
subject to these restrictions at all times.


<R04>
     Subpart K--Special Government Employees Other Than Consultants


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1101  General provision.

    Individuals who are designated as special Government employees 
because of the nature of their services but who are not serving as a 
consultant, expert, or advisory committee member are subject to the 
provisions of Subparts B through I of these regulations. However, the 
provisions of 18 U.S.C. 205, 206, 207, and 208 apply to them only as 
described in Subpart J. Also, the limitation in Sec. 73.735-701(f) on 
the amount of an honorarium that may be received does not apply.


<R04>
                     Subpart L--Disciplinary Action


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1201  General provisions.

    (a) Violations of the regulations contained in the Part may be cause 
for disciplinary action which could be in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law. (For a list of some offenses for which disciplinary 
action may be taken and ``The Code of Ethics for Government Service,'' 
the violation of which may also result in disciplinary action, see 
Appendixes A and B of this Part).
    (b) The type of disciplinary action to be taken must be determined 
in relation to the specific violation. Those responsible for 
recommending and for taking disciplinary action must apply judgment to 
each case, taking into account the general objectives of meeting any 
requirements of law, deterring similar offenses by the employee and 
other employees, and maintaining high standards of employee conduct and 
public confidence. Some types of disciplinary action which may be 
considered are:
    (1) Admonishment
    (2) Written reprimand
    (3) Reassignment
    (4) Suspension
    (5) Demotion
    (6) Removal
    (c) Suspension, demotion, and removal are adverse actions; and when 
such actions are taken, applicable laws, regulations, and policies must 
be followed.

<R04>
                     Subpart M--Reporting Violations


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1301  Responsibility for reporting possible criminal violations.

    An employee who has information which he or she reasonably believes 
indicates a possible offense against the United States by an employee of 
the Department, or any other individual working on behalf of the 
Department, shall immediately report such information to his or her 
supervisor, any management official, or directly to the Office of the 
Inspector General. Offenses covered by the preceding sentence include, 
but are not limited to, bribery,

[[Page 190]]

fraud, perjury, conflict of interest, misuse of funds, equipment, or 
facilities, and other conduct by a government officer or employee, 
grantee, contractor or other person which is prohibited by title 18 of 
the United States Code. Employees and supervisors should refer to 
chapter 5-10 of the Department's General Administration Manual for 
procedures regarding the reporting and handling of such information.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1302  Responsibility for reporting allegations of misconduct.

    An employee who has information which he or she reasonably believes 
indicates the existence of an activity constituting (a) a possible 
violation of a rule or regulation of the Department; or (b) 
mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, or abuse of authority; or (c) a 
substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety, shall 
immediately report such information to his or her supervisor, any 
management official of the Department, or directly to the Office of the 
Inspector General. Employees and supervisors should refer to chapter 5-
10 of the Department's General Administration Manual for procedures 
regarding the reporting and handling of such information. This 
subsection does not cover employee grievances, equal employment 
opportunity complaints, classification appeals, or other matters for 
which a formal government-wide review system has been established by the 
Federal government.


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1303  Prohibition of reprisals.

    (a) Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, 
recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to 
such authority, take or threaten to take any action against any employee 
as a reprisal for making a complaint or providing any information 
pursuant to Sec.Sec. 73.735-1301 and 73.735-1302. If the complaint was 
made or the information was disclosed with the knowledge that it was 
false, or with willful disregard of its truth or falsity, any personnel 
action taken against the employee based on those reasons would not 
constitute a reprisal action.
    (b) An employee who believes that he or she has been threatened with 
a personnel action, any other action, or harassment or has been harmed 
by any action as a reprisal for having made a complaint or providing 
information pursuant to Sec. 73.735-1301 or Sec. 73.735-1302 may request 
the Office of the Inspector General to review his or her allegations. 
Whenever the Inspector General has reason to believe that the 
allegations may be true, he or she will refer the matter to the 
Assistant Secretary for Personnel Administration for appropriate action. 
The Assistant Secretary for Personnel Administration may order a stay of 
any personnel action if he or she determines that there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the personnel action is being taken as a 
reprisal for making a complaint or providing information pursuant to 
Sec. 73.735-1301 or Sec. 73.735-1302.

Sec. 73.735-1304  Referral of matters arising under the standards of this part.

    (a) The Department Ethics Counselor may refer to the Inspector 
General for investigation and/or further action any matter arising under 
the standards of this part.
    (b) The Department Ethics Counselor may refer to the Office of

       Subpart N--Conduct and Responsibilities of Former Employees


<R05>
Sec. 73.735-1401  Prohibitions against post-employment conflicts of interest.

    (a) The purpose of criminal prohibition in 18 U.S.C. 207 is to 
prevent the unfair use of inside knowledge or influence that results 
from Federal service. 18 U.S.C. 207 generally prohibits a former 
employee from acting as another person's representative to the 
Government in particular matters involving a specific party or parties 
in which the employee had been involved while in Federal service. This 
prohibition does not require a former employee to decline employment 
with any organization regardless of his or her dealings with that 
organization while

[[Page 191]]

employed by the Government. It applies solely to activities, not the 
mere existence of an employment arrangement.
    (b) The Office of Government Ethics, Office of Personnel Management, 
has issued Government-wide regulations covering post-employment conflict 
of interest (5 CFR Part 737). Those regulations are incorporated herein 
by reference, and they are available for review in personnel offices 
throughout the Department.

  Appendix A to Part 73--List of Some Offenses for Which Disciplinary 
                           Action May Be Taken

    Following is a list of some offenses for which disciplinary action 
may be taken under this Part. When a statute applies specifically to a 
particular offense, either wholly or in part, the statute is cited.

inclusive. The ``Code of Ethics for Government Service'' is not cited 
because of its general applicability but is published in its entirety in

    I. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-101  Principles and purpose.

    (a) To assure that the business of the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) is conducted effectively, objectively, and without improper 
influence or appearance thereof, all employees must be persons of 
integrity and observe the highest standards of conduct. Because of FDA's 
special regulatory responsibilities to the consumer and industry, its 
employees must be especially alert to avoid any real or appearance of 
conflict of their private interests with their public duties. Their 
actions must be unquestionable and free from suspicion of partiality, 
favoritism, or any hint of conflicting interests. This supplement 
recognizes FDA's public obligation to set reasonable and fair safeguards 
for the prevention of employee conflicts of interest. It is necessary to 
meet FDA's regulatory responsibilities and to otherwise assure full 
protection of the public confidence in the integrity of its employees.
    (b) Since FDA is a unique consumer protection and regulatory agency 
within the Department, the DHHS Standards of Conduct need further 
supplementation to reflect this role. Therefore, for purposes of 
implementing the DHHS Standards of Conduct regulations within the FDA, 
this supplement provides interpretive definitions and additional 
requirements. As further guidance to its employees and supervisory 
officials, FDA will issue internal procedural instructions in accordance 
with this supplement.


<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-103  Responsibilities.

    (a) A ``control activity'' employee shall be personally responsible 
for assuring that he does not hold an interest in any organization whose 
FDA-regulated activities constitute more than an insignificant part of 
its business as defined in Sec. 73a.735-502(b)(2). The Associate 
Commissioner for Administration (or his designee) is available to assist 
such employees in obtaining corporate data necessary to make such a 
determination.
    (b) Other employees are similarly responsible for observing the 
financial interest retention requirements in Sec.Sec. 73a.735-501(b) and 
73a.735-502(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-104  Advice and guidance.

    (a) The Associate Commissioner for Administration (or his designee) 
shall provide day-to-day guidance and assistance to employees and 
supervisors on matters covered by regulations in Part 73 and this part 
of this chapter.
    (b) The FDA Conflict of Interest Review Board shall review and make 
recommendations to the Commissioner on requests for exceptions to 
conflict of interest policies and procedures in regulations in this part 
and Part 73 of this chapter.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-201  Control activity employees formerly associated with 
organizations subject to FDA regulation.

    (a) For a period of 1 year after FDA appointment, or appointment to 
the Food and Drug Division, Office of the General Counsel, a control 
activity employee who was employed in a regulated organization within 1 
year before FDA employment shall not participate in any regulatory 
action before FDA

[[Page 195]]

that involves the former employer organization. Exceptions may be 
authorized only under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) A control activity employee who was previously employed in a 
regulated organization shall not participate in any regulatory action 
before FDA in which the employee had participated personally and 
substantially in behalf of the former employer organization, e.g., drug 
investigations/applications, food additive petitions, matters dealing 
with compliance in areas of radiation-producing products or medical 
devices. Exceptions may be authorized only under paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (c) Employment in a regulated organization includes contractual 
relationships, e.g., attorneys who may have represented an FDA-regulated 
firm or industry or an association of such firms and individuals who may 
have served a firm, industry or association in a consultant capacity.
    (d) Within 30 days after assignment to a control activity position, 
an employee shall submit to his supervisor detailed information 
concerning former industry employers, and dates and substance of 
involvement in such regulatory matters as may be subject to the 
prohibition in paragraph (b) of this action.
    (e) The Commissioner may grant individual exceptions to paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section whenever he determines that strict 
application would not be in the best interests of the United States. A 
memorandum of any exception granted shall be filed for public inspection 
in the Public Records and Documents Center, Food and Drug 
Administration, Room 4-68, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857, 
within 10 days after the Commissioner's decision. The memorandum shall 
include the employee's name, title, grade, summary of official duties, 
prior pertinent industry involvement, a brief description of the 
specific regulatory action in which the employee has been permitted to 
participate, and a statement explaining why such strict application of 
the subpart would not be in the best interests of the United States.

Subpart C [Reserved]


<R04>

<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-401  General provisions.

    (1) Memberships in charitable, religious, social, fraternal, 
recreational, public service, civic, or similar non business

    (b) Control activity employees (defined in Sec. 73a.735-502) will 
not generally be granted approval to:

    (i) The regulated activities of the organization are an

of the organization constitute no more than 10 percent of its annual 
gross sales, and
    (ii) The outside employment is in nonregulated activities of the 
organization.
    (c) All other employees will generally be granted approval to engage 
in outside employment which is compatible with the full performance of 
their FDA duties and responsibilities and which will not give rise to a 
real or apparent conflict of interest. Permissible employment includes 
but is not limited to:
    (1) Employment where the sale of FDA-regulated products is 
incidential to the purpose of the establishment, e.g., hotels, theaters, 
bowling alleys, and sports arenas.
    (2) Sales and clerical occupations relating to regulated products, 
e.g., supermarkets, drugstores, department stores, liquor stores.

[[Page 196]]

work, cook, waiter, waitress, hospital attendant, snack bar vendor,

paid or unpaid outside employment which contributes to their technical 
or professional development, e.g.,

    (2) Pharmacy practice after meeting the following conditions which 
will serve to protect against possible conflicts or apparent conflicts 
of interest and to avoid other problems resulting in embarrassment to 
the employee or FDA:
    (i) The primary purpose of the part-time employment is to contribute 
to the overall professional development of the employee and generally 
enhance his capability to better perform his current FDA duties.
    (ii) The part-time duties will be confined generally to dispensing 
Rx drugs and related professional pharmacy duties.
    (iii) The employee will avoid unrelated nonprofessional duties such 
as supervision or management of store operations, contractual or 
purchasing responsibilities (except normal ``out-of-stock'' 
requisitioning) and repacking and relabeling of bulk items.
    (iv) The employee will demonstrate a high degree of discretion and 
judgment in his contacts with customers and representatives of regulated 
industry and competitor firms so as to avoid giving the impression that:
    (a) His part-time actions, recommendations, opinions, or remarks are 
official points of view;
    (b) He is using his FDA position for private gain by oral 
misrepresentations and false claims of the company's products;
    (c) He is making a Government decision outside official channels, 
e.g., to customers, prescribing physicians, buyers, distributors;
    (d) He or other FDA representatives will give preferential treatment 
to any regulated organization or representatives of such organizations, 
or that FDA employees have not exercised complete independence or 
impartiality in carrying out their regulatory and consumer protection 
responsibilities; or
    (e) His part-time work is creating an adverse effect on the image of 
FDA or discrediting the integrity of official FDA regulatory decisions.


<R04>
                     Subpart E--Financial Interests


<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-501  General provisions.

    (a) No restrictions are placed on ownership of diversified mutual 
funds.
    (b) An FDA employee, other than a control activity employee (defined 
in Sec. 73a.735-502), may have financial interests:
    (1) In an organization whose FDA-regulated activities are an 
insignificant part of its total operations, i.e., no more than 10 
percent of the organization's annual gross sales are in products 
regulated by FDA; or
    (2) In an organization whose FDA-regulated business activities are a 
significant part of its total business operations: Provided, That:
    (i) The holding is less than $5,000 (value or cost at time of 
initial reporting),
    (ii) The holding represents less than 1 percent of the total 
outstanding stock shares of that organization, and
    (iii) No more than 50 percent of the employee's total investment 
value is concentrated in organizations whose FDA-regulated business 
activities are a significant part of their business operations.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this part permitting employees 
to hold financial interests in organizations subject to FDA regulation, 
an employee holding such an interest shall not participate in an 
official matter whose outcome would have a direct and predictable effect 
on his financial interest. However, this prohibition is not applicable 
to:
    (1) Diversified mutual funds, which are exempted from 18 U.S.C. 208 
by Sec. 73.735-501(a) of this chapter.
    (2) Financial interests for which the Commissioner has in advance 
granted a written exception on the ground that the public interest would 
be served if a particular employee is allowed to participate in an

outcome may have a direct and predictable effect on the employee's 
financial interest. Such exemptions will be granted only in exceptional 
circumstances. Any determination to authorize such exceptions shall be 
made in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) and documented for public 
inspection in accordance with Sec. 73a.735-504.


<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-502  Employees in regulatory activities.

    (a) An employee in regulatory activities (``control activity'' 
employee) may hold financial interests in an FDA-regulated organization 
only if either of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The regulated activities of the organization are an 
``insignificant'' part of its total business operations, or
    (2) Written approval for an individual exception is granted by the 
Commissioner in accordance with Sec. 73a.735-504; however, such approval 
will not be considered unless all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) Retention of the financial interest does not give rise to an 
actual conflict of interest;
    (ii) Acquisition of the financial interest occurred by marriage or 
inheritance, or the interest was held prior to an FDA reorganization, 
change in regulations, or similar circumstances beyond the control of 
the employee that resulted in the interest becoming prohibited;
    (iii) No direct relationship exists between the employee's official 
duties and the regulated activities of the organization in which the 
financial interest is held;
    (iv) The employee occupies a position below that of Bureau/Deputy 
Bureau Director (or Assistant/Deputy General Counsel, Food and Drug 
Division, Office of the General Counsel); and
    (v) The employee agrees to refrain from engaging, either directly or 
indirectly, in transactions that are designed to increase the value of 
his ``excepted'' financial interest.
    (b) To administer provisions within this part, the following 
interpretations apply:
    (1) A ``control activity'' employee (``control activity'' positions 
are identified in Appendix C to Part 73 of this chapter), means one who:
    (i) Occupies an FDA position classified at GS-11 or above, or PHS 
Commissioned Officer 0-3 or above, or equivalent;
    (ii) Occupies an FDA position below GS-11 with duties of a nature 
that the employee could in the discharge of his official duties and 
responsibilities cause an economic advantage for or impose a handicap on 
a non-Federal enterprise (includes investigators, inspectors, regulatory 
analysts);
    (iii) Occupies a position at GS-11 or above in the Office of the 
Assistant General Counsel, Food and Drug Division.
    (2) ``Insignificant'' (part of an organization's total business 
operations) means that the FDA-regulated products constitute no more 
than 10 percent of the organization's annual gross sales.


<R05>
Sec. 73a.735-504  Exceptions.

    (a) A control activity employee who can satisfy all of the 
conditions specified in Sec. 73a.735-502(a)(2) may submit a request to 
retain a prohibited financial interest. Any such request must be 
submitted no later than 30 days after the event that results in the 
employee holding the prohibited financial interest. Such requests for 
exception should be forwarded in writing through supervisory channels to 
the Associate Commissioner for Administration for review by the FDA 
Conflict of Interest Review Board and subsequent recommendation to the 
Commissioner. All decisions on requests for exceptions shall be in 
writing and a copy furnished to the employee involved.
    (b) A memorandum of each approved exception shall be filed in the 
Public Records and Documents Center for public inspection. Such public 
disclosure shall be made within 10 days after the Commissioner's 
decision. The following is an example of the format of such memorandum 
(in a hypothetical employee situation):
    (1) Employee: Joe Doe.
    (2) Title: Research Chemist.
    (3) Grade/Salary: GS-14.
    (4) Organization: Bureau of Biologics, Food and Drug Administration, 
Bethesda, Md.
    (5) Date of employee's request for exception: ------.

[[Page 198]]

    (6) Date of Commissioner's approval: ------.
    (7) Basis for exception: Employee owns financial interest in the ABC 
Foods Corporation, and permanent retention is normally prohibited under 
FDA/HHS conflict of interest regulations for such an employee. The 
employee, however, acquired this financial interest prior to his 
reassignment to FDA on ------, which was part of a major Department 
reorganization transferring certain functions from NIH to the FDA (i.e., 
FDA's Bureau of Biologics). At the time of acquisition and immediately 
prior to the reorganization, the employee's financial interest was 
allowable under Department regulations. The employee's official duties 
are fully confined to the matters under the jurisdiction of the Bureau 
of Biologics, and his official duties do not involve any contact with 
the food industry. The Commissioner has determined that an exception is 
warranted under the following criteria:
    (i) Acquisition occurred prior to Department reorganization;
    (ii) Financial interest retention will not give rise to an actual 
conflict of interest situation;
    (iii) There is no direct relationship between the employee's 
official duties and the regulated activities of ABC Foods;
    (iv) The employee occupies a position below that of Bureau or Deputy 
Bureau Director (or equivalent position in the Office of the 
Commissioner); and
    (v) The employee agrees to refrain from engaging in any direct or 
indirect transactions that are designed to increase the value/shares of 
the ``excepted'' ABC Foods interests.

This exception is considered equitable to the employee involved, and 
retention of the ABC Foods interest will not in any way impair the 
interests of the Government or of the public.
    (c) In interpreting the requirement of Sec. 73a.735-502(a)(2)(v), 
events not involving employee discretion (e.g., accepting dividends in 
the form of cash or additional shares) do not constitute transactions 
designed to increase the value/shares of an ``excepted'' financial 
interest. A transaction involving discretion, e.g., exercise of stock 
options, may be made only if proposed to the Associate Commissioner for 
Administration and approved by the Conflict of Interest Review Board as 
an amendment to the original exception. A memorandum recording such 
approval shall be made public in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (d) An employee may temporarily retain a prohibited financial 
interest pending review of a written request for an exception submitted 
in accordance with this section.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 73a.735-501(c), no employee may 
participate in an official matter whose outcome will have a direct and 
predictable effect on a financial interest held by him. This prohibition 
applies to official matters handled before and after approval of an 
exception under this section.

    (a) If an officer or employee of the Department has reason to 
believe that a former officer or employee of the Department has violated 
any provision of 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c) or if any such officer or 
employee receives information to that effect, he/she shall promptly make 
a written report thereof which shall be forwarded to the Inspector 
General. If any other person has information of such violations, he/she 
may make a report thereof to the Inspector General or to any officer or 
employee of the Department.
    (b) The Inspector General shall coordinate proceedings under this 
part with the Department of Justice in cases where it appears criminal 
prosecution is warranted.


<R05>
Sec. 73b.4  Proceedings.

    (a) Upon a determination by the Assistant General Counsel, Business 
and Administrative Law Division, or his/her designee, after 
investigation by the Inspector General, that there is reasonable cause 
to believe that a former officer or employee, including a former special 
Government employee, of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(former departmental employee) has violated 18 US.C. 207 (a), (b) or 
(c), the Assistant General Counsel, or his/her designee, shall cause a 
copy of written charges of the violation(s) to be served upon such 
individual, either personally or by registered mail. The charges shall 
be accompanied by a notice to the former departmental employee to show 
cause within a specified time of not less than 30 days after receipt of 
the notice why he/she should not be prohibited from engaging in 
representational activities in relation to matters pending in the 
Department, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. 207(j), or subjected to other 
appropriate debarment or disqualification action under that statute. The 
notice to show cause shall include:
    (1) A statement of allegations, and their bases, sufficiently 
detailed to enable the former departmental employee to prepare an 
adequate defense;
    (2) Notification of the right to a hearing, and that failure to 
answer shall constitute a waiver of defense; and
    (3) An explanation of the method by which a hearing may be 
requested.
    (b) If a former departmental employee who submits an answer to the 
notice to show cause does not request a hearing or if the Assistant 
General Counsel does not receive an answer within the time prescribed by 
the notice, the Assistant General Counsel shall forward the record, 
including the report(s) of investigation, to the Assistant Secretary for 
Personnel Administration (Assistant Secretary). In the case of a failure 
to answer, such failure shall constitute a waiver of defense.
    (c) Upon receipt of a former departmental employee's request for a 
hearing, the Assistant General Counsel shall notify him/her of the time 
and

[[Page 200]]

place thereof, giving due regard both to such person's need for an 
adequate period to prepare a suitable defense and an expeditious 
resolution of allegations that may be damaging to his or her reputation.
    (d) The presiding officer at the hearing and any related proceedings 
shall be a federal administrative law judge. He/she shall insure that 
the former departmental employee has the following rights:
    (1) To self-representation or representation by counsel,
    (2) To introduce and examine witnesses and submit physical evidence,
    (3) To confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses,

the proceedings.
    (f) A decision adverse to the former departmental employee must be 
sustained by substantial evidence that he/she violated 18 U.S.C. 207 
(a), (b) or (c). If a judgment of conviction has been entered by a 
Federal district court against the former departmental employee for 
violation of 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), regardless of whether the 
judgment is based upon a verdict or a plea of guilty, such judgment of 
conviction shall be conclusive evidence of a violation of 18 U.S.C. 207 
(a), (b) or (c), unless and until the judgment is vacated or reversed on 
appeal.
    (g) The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision 
based exclusively on the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together 
with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, and shall set 
forth in the decision findings and conclusions, supported by reasons, on 
the material issues of fact and law presented on the record.
    (h) Within 30 days after issuance of the initial decision, either 
party may appeal in writing to the Assistant Secretary who in that event 
shall issue the final decision based on the record of the proceedings or 
those portions thereof cited by the parties to limit the issues. If the 
final decision modifies or reverses the initial decision, the Assistant 
Secretary shall specify the findings of fact and conclusions of law that 
vary from those of the presiding officer.
    (i) If a former departmental employee fails to appeal from an 
adverse initial decision within the prescribed period of time, the 
administrative law judge shall forward the record of the proceedings to 
the Assistant Secretary.
    (j) In the case of a former departmental employee who filed an 
answer to the notice to show cause but did not request a hearing, the 
Assistant Secretary shall make the final decision on the record 
submitted to him by the Assistant General Counsel pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (k) In a case where:
    (1) The defense has been waived,
    (2) The former departmental employee has failed to appeal from an 
adverse initial decision, or
    (3) The Assistant Secretary has issued a final decision that the 
former departmental employee violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c),

The Assistant Secretary may issue an order:
    (i) Prohibiting the former departmental employee from making, on 
behalf of any other person (except the United States), any informal or 
formal appearance before, or, with the intent to influence, any oral or 
written communication to, the Department on a pending matter of business 
for a period not to exceed five years, or
    (ii) Prescribing other appropriate debarment or disqualification 
action, such as limiting the action to a particular organization or 
organizations within the Department.
    (l) An order issued under either paragraph (k)(i) or (k)(ii) of this 
section shall be supplemented by a directive to officers and employees 
of the Department not to engage in conduct in relation to the former 
departmental employee that would contravene such order.

    (a) Hearings shall be stenographically recorded and transcribed and 
the testimony of witnesses shall be taken

[[Page 201]]

under oath or affirmation. Hearings will be closed unless an open 
hearing is requested by the respondent, except that if classified 
information or protected information of third parties is likely to be 
adduced at the hearing, it will remain closed. If either party to the 
proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, after due notice thereof has 
been sent to him/her, he/she shall be deemed to have waived the right to 
a hearing and the administrative law judge may make a decision on the 
basis of the record before him/her at that time.
    (b) The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity are 
not controlling in hearings under this part. However, the administrative 
law judge shall exclude evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, or 
unduly repetitious.
    (c) Depositions for use at a hearing may, with the consent of the 
parties in writing or the written approval of the administrative law 
judge be taken by either the Assistant General Counsel or the respondent 
or their duly authorized representatives. Depositions may be taken upon 
oral or written interrogatories. There shall be at least 10 days written 
notice to the other party. The requirement of a 10-day written notice 
may be waived by the parties in writing. When a deposition is taken upon 
written interrogatories, any cross-examination shall be upon written 
interrogatories. Copies of such written interrogatories shall be served 
upon the other party with the notice, and copies of any written cross-
interrogation shall be mailed or delivered to the opposing party at 
least 5 days before the date of taking the depositions, unless the 
parties mutually agree otherwise. Expenses in the reporting of 
depositions shall be borne by the party at whose instance the deposition 
is taken.

instructions or authorized by the terms and conditions of the award.

an organizational component within the Office of the Secretary, HHS, and 
reports to the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget.
    OMB means the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays or expenditures mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense charged, 
the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the amount of 
cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports prepared 
on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for 
direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense 
incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the net 
increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods 
and other property received, for services performed by employees, 
contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming 
owed under programs for which no current services or performance are 
required.
    Personal property means property of any kind except real property. 
It may be tangible, having physical existence, or intangible, having no 
physical existence, such as copyrights, patents, or securities.
    Prior approval means written approval by an authorized HHS official 
evidencing prior consent.
    Program income means gross income earned by the recipient that is 
directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the 
award (see exclusions in Sec. 74.24 (e) and (h)). Program income 
includes, but is not limited to,

[[Page 205]]

income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or 
personal property acquired under federally-funded projects, the sale of 
commodities or items fabricated under an award, license fees and 
royalties on patents and copyrights, and interest on loans made with 
award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program 
income. Except as otherwise provided in the terms and conditions of the 
award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on 
loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of 
them. Furthermore, program income does not include taxes, special 
assessments, levies, and fines raised by governmental recipients.
    Project costs means all allowable costs, as set forth in the 
applicable Federal cost principles (see Sec. 74.27), incurred by a 
recipient and the value of the contributions made by third parties in 
accomplishing the objectives of the award during the project period.
    Project period means the period established in the award document 
during which HHS awarding agency sponsorship begins and ends.
    Property means, unless otherwise stated, real property, equipment, 
intangible property and debt instruments.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and equipment.
    Recipient means an organization receiving financial assistance 
directly from an HHS awarding agency to carry out a project or program. 
The term includes public and private institutions of higher education, 
public and private hospitals, commercial organizations, and other quasi-
public and private nonprofit organizations such as, but not limited to, 
community action agencies, research institutes, educational 
associations, and health centers. The term may include foreign or 
international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations) 
which are recipients, subrecipients, or contractors or subcontractors of 
recipients or subrecipients at the discretion of the HHS awarding 
agency. The term does not include government-owned contractor-operated 
facilities or research centers providing continued support for mission-
oriented, large-scale programs that are government-owned or controlled, 
or are designated as federally-funded research and development centers. 
For entitlement programs listed at 45 CFR 92.4(a)(3), (a)(7), and (a)(8) 
``recipient'' means the government to which an HHS awarding agency 
awards funds and which is accountable for the use of the funds provided. 
The recipient in this case is the entire legal entity even if only a 
particular component of the entity is designated in the award document.
    Research and development means all research activities, both basic 
and applied, and all development activities that are supported at 
universities, colleges, hospitals, other nonprofit institutions, and 
commercial organizations. ``Research'' is defined as a systematic study 
directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the 
subject studied. ``Development'' is the systematic use of knowledge and 
understanding gained from research directed toward the production of 
useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including design and 
development of prototypes and processes. The term research also includes 
activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques 
where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and 
development activities and where such activities are not included in the 
instruction function.
    Small awards means a grant or cooperative agreement not exceeding 
the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) 
(currently $100,000).
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments.
    Subaward means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient 
to an eligible subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier 
subrecipient. The term includes financial assistance when provided by 
any legal agreement, even if the agreement is called a contract, but 
does not include procurement of goods

[[Page 206]]

and services nor does it include any form of assistance which is 
excluded from the definition of ``award'' in this section.
    Subrecipient means the legal entity to which a subaward is made and 
which is accountable to the recipient for the use of the funds provided. 
The term may include foreign or international organizations (such as 
agencies of the United Nations) at the discretion of the HHS awarding 
agency.
    Supplies means all personal property excluding equipment, intangible 
property, and debt instruments as defined in this section, and 
inventions of a contractor conceived or first actually reduced to 
practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement (``subject 
inventions''), as defined in 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Business Firms Under Government 
Grants, Contracts, and Cooperative Agreements.''
    Suspension means an action by the HHS awarding agency that 
temporarily withdraws the agency's financial assistance sponsorship 
under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a 
decision to terminate the award.
    Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension under 
HHS regulations (45 CFR part 76) implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, 
``Debarment and Suspension.''
    Termination means the cancellation of HHS awarding agency 
sponsorship, in whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior 
to the date of completion. For the entitlement programs listed at 45 CFR 
92.4 (a)(3), (a)(7), and (a)(8), ``termination'' shall have that meaning 
assigned at 45 CFR 92.3.
    Third party in-kind contributions means the value of non-cash 
contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. Third party in-kind 
contributions may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies 
and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services 
directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or 
program.
    Unliquidated obligations, for financial reports prepared on a cash 
basis, mean the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient that has 
not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, 
they represent the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient for 
which an outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
HHS awarding agency that has not been obligated by the recipient and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.
    Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount 
awarded and the amount which could have been awarded under the 
recipient's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.
    Working capital advance means a procedure whereby funds are advanced 
to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for a given 
initial period.

Sec. 74.3  Effect on other issuances.

    This part supersedes all administrative requirements of codified 
program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other nonregulatory 
materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this part, 
except to the extent they are required by Federal statute, or authorized 
in accordance with the deviations provision in Sec. 74.4.

Sec. 74.4  Deviations.

    (a) After consultation with OMB, the HHS OGAM may grant exceptions 
to HHS awarding agencies for classes of awards or recipients subject to 
the requirements of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by 
statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from 
the requirements of this part shall be permitted only in unusual 
circumstances. HHS awarding agencies may apply more restrictive 
requirements to a class of awards or recipients when approved by the 
OGAM, after consultation with the OMB. HHS awarding agencies may apply 
less restrictive requirements without approval by the

[[Page 207]]

OGAM when making small awards except for those requirements which are 
statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by HHS 
awarding agencies without seeking prior approval from the OGAM. OGAM 
will maintain a record of all requests for exceptions from the 
provisions of this part that have been approved for classes of awards or 
recipients.
    (b) As a matter of Departmental policy, requests for individual case 
deviations will be considered favorably by HHS and its awarding agencies 
whenever the deviation will facilitate comprehensive or integrated 
service delivery, or multiple-source consolidated awards, unless the 
deviation would impair the integrity of the program.

Sec. 74.5  Subawards.

    (a) Unless inconsistent with statutory requirements, this part 
(except for Sec. 74.12 and the forms prescribed in Sec. 74.22) shall 
apply to--
    (1) Except for subawards under block grants (45 CFR part 96), all 
subawards received by institutions of higher education, hospitals, other 
nonprofit organizations, and commercial organizations from any recipient 
of an HHS award, including any subawards received from States, local 
governments, and Indian tribal governments covered by 45 CFR part 92; 
and
    (2) All subawards received from States by any entity, including a 
government entity, under the entitlement programs identified at 45 CFR 
part 92, Sec. 92.4 (a), (a)(7), and (a)(8), except that Sec.Sec. 74.12 
and 74.25 of this part shall not apply.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, when 
State, local, and Indian Tribal government recipients of HHS awards make 
subawards to a government entity, they shall apply the regulations at 45 
CFR part 92, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and 
Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,'' or State rules, 
whichever apply, to such awards.

    Source: 59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 74.10  Purpose.

    Sections 74.11 through 74.17 prescribe forms and instructions and 
other pre-award matters to be used in applying for HHS awards.


<R05>
Sec. 74.11  Pre-award policies.

    (a) Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. The 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, 31 U.S.C. 6301-08, governs 
the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or 
cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a 
transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation 
authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing 
between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, 
``substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and 
the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the 
activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when 
the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the 
direct benefit or use of the HHS awarding agency.
    (b) HHS awarding agencies shall notify the public of funding 
priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities 
are established by Federal statute.


<R05>
Sec. 74.12  Forms for applying for HHS financial assistance.

    (a) HHS awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report 
clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling Paperwork 
Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used in place of or as 
a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF-424) series. However, HHS 
awarding agencies should use the SF-424 series and its program narrative 
whenever possible.
    (b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and 
instructions prescribed by the HHS awarding agency. Applicants shall 
submit the original and two copies of any applications

[[Page 208]]

unless additional copies are required pursuant to 5 CFR part 1320.
    (c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, as amended by E.O. 
12416, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant 
shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for 
Federal Assistance) indicating whether the application was subject to 
review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address 
of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the HHS awarding 
agency or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall 
advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made 
has been selected by that State for review. (See also 45 CFR part 100.)
    (d) HHS awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form will 
indicate on the application form they prescribe whether the application 
is subject to review by the State under E.O. 12372.
    (e) This section does not apply to applications for subawards.

[59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 11746, Mar. 22, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 74.13  Debarment and suspension.

    Recipients are subject to the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment 
and Suspension,'' 45 CFR part 76. This common rule restricts subawards 
and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or 
otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal 
assistance programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 74.14  Special award conditions.

    (a) The HHS awarding agency may impose additional requirements as 
needed, without regard to Sec. 74.4, above, if an applicant or 
recipient:
    (1) Has a history of poor performance;
    (2) Is not financially stable;
    (3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards 
prescribed in this part;
    (4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous 
award; or
    (5) Is not otherwise responsible.
    (b) When it imposes any additional requirements, the HHS awarding 
agency must notify the recipient in writing as to the following:
    (1) The nature of the additional requirements;
    (2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;
    (3) The nature of the corrective actions needed;
    (4) The time allowed for completing the corrective actions; and
    (5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional 
requirements imposed.
    (c) The HHS awarding agency will promptly remove any additional 
requirements once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 74.15  Metric system of measurement.

    The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act, 15 U.S.C. 205, declares that the metric system is 
the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act 
requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of 
measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other 
business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where 
the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause 
significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded 
activities. HHS awarding agencies will follow the provisions of E.O. 
12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.''


<R05>
Sec. 74.16  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA, Section 6002 of 
Pub. L. No. 94-580 (Codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962)).

    Under the Act, any State agency or agency of a political subdivision 
of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with 
section 6002 of the RCRA. This section requires that preference be given 
in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing 
recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247-254). 
Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, 
hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations that receive direct HHS 
awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement 
programs funded

[[Page 209]]

with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the 
EPA guidelines.


<R05>
Sec. 74.17  Certifications and representations.

    Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each HHS 
awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to 
submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive 
order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing 
and continuing relationships with the HHS awarding agency. Annual 
certifications and representations shall be signed by the responsible 
official(s) with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the 
pertinent requirements.

                    Financial and Program Management


<R05>
Sec. 74.20  Purpose of financial and program management.

    Sections 74.21 through 74.28 prescribe standards for financial 
management systems, methods for making payments, and rules for 
satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for 
program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining 
allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.


<R05>
Sec. 74.21  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) Recipients shall relate financial data to performance data and 
develop unit cost information whenever practical. For awards that 
support research, unit cost information is usually not appropriate.
    (b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the 
following:
    (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial 
results of each HHS-sponsored project or program in accordance with the 
reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 74.52. If the HHS awarding 
agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that 
maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient 
shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These 
recipients may develop such accrual data for their reports on the basis 
of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of 
funds for HHS-sponsored activities. These records shall contain 
information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, 
unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.
    (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, 
property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all 
such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
    (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. 
Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to 
performance and unit cost data. (Unit cost data are usually not 
appropriate for awards that support research.)
    (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the 
issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means 
for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions 
of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) and its 
implementing regulations, ``Rules and Procedures for Funds Transfers,'' 
(31 CFR part 205) apply, payment methods of State agencies, 
instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA 
Treasury-State Agreements, or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 
CFR 205.9(f).
    (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, 
allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions 
of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions 
of the award.
    (7) Accounting records, including cost accounting records, that are 
supported by source documentation.
    (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment 
of money borrowed by the recipient, the

[[Page 210]]

HHS awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and 
insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are 
not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
    (d) The HHS awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond 
coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the 
Federal Government's interest.
    (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described in Sec. 
74.21 (c) and (d), the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding 
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 
CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business with the United 
States.''


<R05>
Sec. 74.22  Payment.

    (a) Unless inconsistent with statutory program purposes, payment 
methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds 
from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, 
warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods 
of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with 
Treasury-State CMIA agreements, or the CMIA default procedures codified 
at 31 CFR 205.9, to the extent that either applies.
    (b)(1) Recipients will be paid in advance, provided they maintain or 
demonstrate the willingness to maintain:
    (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient; and
    (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund 
control and accountability as established in Sec. 74.21.
    (2) Unless inconsistent with statutory program purposes, cash 
advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum 
amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, 
immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying 
out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and 
amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively 
feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for 
direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any 
allowable indirect costs.
    (c) Whenever possible, advances will be consolidated to cover 
anticipated cash needs for all awards made by all HHS awarding agencies 
to the recipient.
    (1) Advance payment mechanisms include electronic funds transfer, 
with Treasury checks available on an exception basis.
    (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.
    (3) Recipients may submit requests for advances and reimbursements 
at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.
    (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted 
on PMS-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as 
may be authorized by HHS. This form is not to be used when Treasury 
check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through 
the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special 
HHS-wide instructions for electronic funds transfer.
    (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in 
paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. The HHS awarding agency may 
also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major 
portion of the construction project is accomplished through private 
market financing or Federal loans, and the HHS assistance constitutes a 
minor portion of the project.
    (1) When the reimbursement method is used, HHS will make payment 
within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is 
improper.
    (2) Recipients may submit a request for reimbursement at least 
monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.
    (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and 
the HHS awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not 
feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, HHS may 
provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, 
HHS advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement 
needs for an initial period generally geared to the recipient's 
disbursing cycle. Thereafter,

[[Page 211]]

HHS reimburses the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The 
working capital advance method of payment will not be used for 
recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their 
subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.
    (g) Unless inconsistent with statutory program purposes, to the 
extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from 
repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, 
rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest 
earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.
    (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, the HHS awarding agency 
will not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any 
time during the project period unless paragraph (h) (1) or (2) of this 
section applies:
    (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, 
the terms and conditions of the award, or HHS awarding agency reporting 
requirements.
    (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the 
United States. Under such conditions, the HHS awarding agency may, upon 
reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made 
for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are 
corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
(See 45 CFR part 30).
    (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as 
depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows.
    (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section, HHS will not require separate depository accounts for funds 
provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for 
depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must 
be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.
    (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in 
insured accounts whenever possible.
    (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities 
for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients are 
encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).
    (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest 
bearing accounts, unless one of the following conditions apply:
    (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per 
year.
    (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not 
be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash 
balances.
    (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so 
high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-
Federal cash resources.
    (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations 
do not apply (see 31 CFR part 205), interest earned on Federal advances 
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to the 
Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. 
Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Recipients with Electronic Funds Transfer 
capability should use an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit 
System. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the 
recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals 
shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject 
to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary 
awards without prior written approval from the HHS awarding agency, it 
waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA. (See Sec. 
74.25(d)).
    (m) PMS-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Recipients shall 
use the PMS-270 to request advances or reimbursement for all programs 
when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not 
used. HHS shall not require recipients to submit more than an original 
and two copies.
    (n) Recipients and subrecipients are not required to use forms PMS-
270 and 272 in connection with subaward payments.

<R05>
Sec. 74.23  Cost sharing or matching.

    (a) To be accepted, all cost sharing or matching contributions, 
including cash and third party in-kind, shall meet all of the following 
criteria:
    (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records;
    (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-
assisted project or program;
    (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of project or program objectives;
    (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles;
    (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, 
except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing 
or matching;
    (6) Are provided for in the approved budget; and
    (7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.
    (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost 
sharing or matching.
    (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property 
shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. 
If the HHS awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or 
land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, 
the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be 
the lesser of:
    (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property 
recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation; 
or
    (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient 
justification, the HHS awarding agency may approve the use of the 
current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds 
the certified value at the time of donation to the project.
    (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical 
personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be 
counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and 
necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer 
services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the 
recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required 
skills are not found in the recipient's organization, rates shall be 
consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which 
the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either 
case, fringe benefits consistent with those paid that are reasonable, 
allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.
    (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services 
of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular 
rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, 
allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided 
these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally 
paid.
    (f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable property, 
office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. 
Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or 
matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market 
value of the property at the time of the donation.
    (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for 
donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the 
recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph 
(g)(1) or (2) of this section applies:
    (1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the 
acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the 
donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that 
require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only 
depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. 
However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair 
rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the HHS awarding 
agency has approved the charges.
    (h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance 
with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following 
qualifications.
    (1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its 
fair market value at the time of donation to

[[Page 213]]

the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., 
certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration 
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the 
recipient.
    (2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market 
value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of 
donation.
    (3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental 
value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of 
comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the 
same locality.
    (4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental 
value.
    (i) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting 
records for in-kind contributions from third parties.
    (1) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent 
feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its 
own employees, including time records.
    (2) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, 
material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.

<R05>
Sec. 74.24  Program income.

    (a) The standards set forth in this section shall be used to account 
for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with 
Federal funds.
    (b) Except as provided below in paragraph (h) of this section, 
program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the 
recipient and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award, 
shall be used in one or more of the following ways:
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project or program, and used to 
further eligible project or program objectives;
    (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program; 
or
    (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in 
determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs 
is based.
    (c) When the HHS awarding agency authorizes the disposition of 
program income as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (d) In the event that the HHS awarding agency does not specify in 
the terms and conditions of the award how program income is to be used, 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all 
projects or programs except research. For awards that support 
performance of research work, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall 
apply automatically unless:
    (1) The HHS awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions of 
the award another alternative; or
    (2) The recipient is subject to special award conditions under Sec. 
74.14; or
    (3) The recipient is a commercial organization (see Sec. 74.82).
    (e) Unless the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, 
recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding 
program income earned after the end of the project period.
    (f) Costs incident to the generation of program income may be 
deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these 
costs have not been charged to the award.
    (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in 
accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards. (See 
Sec.Sec. 74.30 through 74.37, below).
    (h) The Patent and Trademark Laws Amendments, 35 U.S.C. section 200-
212, apply to inventions made under an award for performance of 
experimental, developmental, or research work. Unless the terms and 
conditions for the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no 
obligation to HHS with respect to program income earned from license 
fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent 
applications, trademarks, and inventions made under an award. However, 
no scholarship, fellowship, training grant, or other funding agreement 
made primarily to a recipient for educational purposes will contain any 
provision giving the Federal agency rights to inventions made by the 
recipient.

[[Page 214]]


<R05>
Sec. 74.25  Revision of budget and program plans.

    (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or 
program as approved during the award process. It may include either the 
sum of the Federal and non-Federal shares, or only the Federal share, 
depending upon HHS awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to 
performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
    (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and 
program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan 
revisions, in accordance with this section. Except as provided at 
Sec.Sec. 74.4, 74.14, and this section, HHS awarding agencies may not 
impose other prior approval requirements for specific items.
    (c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall obtain prior 
approvals from the HHS awarding agency for one or more of the following 
program or budget related reasons.
    (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program 
(even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written 
approval).
    (2) Change in the project director or principal investigator or 
other key persons specified in the application or award document.
    (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent 
reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project 
director or principal investigator.
    (4) The need for additional Federal funding.
    (5) The inclusion, unless waived by the HHS awarding agency, of 
costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions;'' OMB Circular A-122, 
``Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations;'' or appendix E of this 
part, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and 
Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR part 
31, ``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as applicable.
    (6) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct 
payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.
    (7) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved 
award, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an 
award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, 
material, equipment or general support services.
    (8) The inclusion of research patient care costs in research awards 
made for the performance of research work.
    (d) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) 
of this section, the HHS awarding agency is authorized, at its option, 
to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals 
required by this part and its appendixes. Additional waivers may be 
granted authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following:
    (1) Incur pre-award costs up to 90 calendar days prior to award, or 
more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the HHS awarding 
agency. However, all pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's 
risk: the HHS awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such 
costs if for any reason the applicant does not receive an award or if 
the award to the recipient is less than anticipated and inadequate to 
cover such costs.
    (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the 
award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions identified 
at paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section apply. For one-
time extensions, the recipient must notify the HHS awarding agency in 
writing, with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date, at 
least 10 days before the date specified in the award. This one-time 
extension may not be exercised either by recipients or HHS awarding 
agencies merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. Such 
extensions are not permitted where:
    (i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension; or
    (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds; or
    (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives 
or scope of the project.
    (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding 
periods.
    (4) For awards that support performance of research work, unless the 
HHS awarding agency provides otherwise in

[[Page 215]]

the award, or the award is subject to Sec. 74.14 or subpart E of this 
Part, the prior approval requirements described in paragraphs (d) (1)-
(3) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not 
obtain such prior approvals). However, extension of award expiration 
dates must be approved by the HHS awarding agency if one of the 
conditions in paragraph (d)(2) of this section applies.
    (e) The HHS awarding agencies may not permit any budget changes in a 
recipient's award that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used 
for purposes other then those consistent with the original purpose of 
the authorization and appropriation under which the award was funded.
    (f) For construction awards, recipients shall obtain prior written 
approval promptly from the HHS awarding agency for budget revisions 
whenever:
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the project or program;
    (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the 
project; or
    (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which 
prior written approval requirements apply in keeping with the applicable 
cost principles listed in Sec. 74.27.
    (g) When an HHS awarding agency makes an award that provides support 
for both construction and nonconstruction work, it may require the 
recipient to obtain prior approval before making any fund or budget 
transfers between the two types of work supported.
    (h) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, recipients 
shall notify the HHS awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the 
amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of 
the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent 
of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not 
be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a 
continuation award.
    (i) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request 
for budget revisions, HHS awarding agencies shall notify the recipient 
whether its requested budget revisions have been approved. If the 
requested revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 
calendar days, the HHS awarding agency must inform the recipient in 
writing of the date when the recipient may expect a decision.
    (j) When requesting approval for budget changes, recipients shall 
make their requests in writing.
    (k) All approvals granted in keeping with the provisions of this 
section shall not be valid unless they are in writing, and signed by at 
least one of the following HHS officials:
    (1) The Head of the HHS Operating or Staff Division that made the 
award or subordinate official with proper delegated authority from the 
Head, including the Head of the Regional Office of the HHS Operating or 
Staff Division that made the award; or
    (2) The responsible Grants Officer of the HHS Operating or Staff 
Division that made the award or an individual duly authorized by the 
Grants Officer.
    (l) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a class deviation has been approved by OMB.

Sec. 74.26  Non-Federal audits.

    (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher 
education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall 
be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act 
Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, 
``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit 
requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 
U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of States, 
Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (c) For-profit hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of 
revised OMB Circular A-133 shall be subject to the audit requirements of 
the Federal awarding agencies.
    (d)(1) Recipients and subrecipients that are commercial 
organizations (including for-profit hospitals) have two options 
regarding audits:

[[Page 216]]

    (i) A financial related audit (as defined in the Government Auditing 
Standards, GPO Stock <greek-i>020-000-00-265-4) of a particular award in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards, in those cases where the 
recipient receives awards under only one HHS program; or, if awards are 
received under multiple HHS programs, a financial related audit of all 
HHS awards in accordance with Government Auditing Standards; or
    (ii) An audit that meets the requirements contained in OMB Circular 
A-133.
    (2) Commercial organizations that receive annual HHS awards totaling 
less than OMB Circular A-133's audit requirement threshold are exempt 
from requirements for a non-Federal audit for that year, but records 
must be available for review by appropriate officials of Federal 
agencies.

[59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 11746, Mar. 22, 1996;

45945, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 74.27  Allowable costs.

    (a) For each kind of recipient, there is a particular set of Federal 
principles that applies in determining allowable costs. Allowability of 
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles 
applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of 
costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal 
governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB 
Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.'' The 
allowability of costs incurred by nonprofit organizations (except for 
those listed in Attachment C of Circular A-122) is determined in 
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles 
for Nonprofit Organizations'' and paragraph (b) of this section. The 
allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is 
determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of 
costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the 
provisions of appendix E of this part, ``Principles for Determining 
Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts 
with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial 
organizations and those nonprofit organizations listed in Attachment C 
to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31, except that 
independent research and development costs are unallowable.
    (b) OMB Circular A-122 does not cover the treatment of bid and 
proposal costs or independent research and development costs. The 
following rules apply to these costs for nonprofit organizations subject 
to that Circular.
    (1) Bid and proposal costs. Bid and proposal costs are the immediate 
costs of preparing bids, proposals, and applications for Federal and 
non-Federal awards, contracts, and other agreements, including the 
development of scientific, cost, and other data needed to support the 
bids, proposals, and applications. Bid and proposal costs of the current 
accounting period are allowable as indirect costs. Bid and proposal 
costs of past accounting periods are unallowable in the current period. 
However, if the recipient's established practice is to treat these costs 
by some other method, they may be accepted if they are found to be 
reasonable and equitable. Bid and proposal costs do not include 
independent research and development costs covered by paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, or pre-award costs covered by OMB Circular A-122, 
Attachment B, paragraph 33 and Sec. 74.25(d)(1).
    (2) Independent Research and Development costs. Independent research 
and development is research and development which is conducted by an 
organization, and which is not sponsored by Federal or non-Federal 
awards, contracts, or other agreements. Independent research and 
development shall be allocated its proportionate share of indirect costs 
on the same basis as the allocation of indirect costs to sponsored 
research and development. The cost of independent research and 
development, including their proportionate share of indirect costs, are 
unallowable.

[[Page 217]]


<R05>
Sec. 74.28  Period of availability of funds.

    Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the 
award only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during 
the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the HHS 
awarding agency pursuant to Sec. 74.25(d)(1).

                           Property Standards


<R05>
Sec. 74.30  Purpose of property standards.

    Sections 74.31 through 74.37 set forth uniform standards governing 
management and disposition of property furnished by HHS or whose cost 
was charged directly to a project supported by an HHS award. The HHS 
awarding agency may not impose additional requirements, unless 
specifically required to do so by Federal statute. The recipient may use 
its own property management standards and procedures provided they meet 
the provisions of Sec.Sec. 74.31 through 74.37.


<R05>
Sec. 74.31  Insurance coverage.

    Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance 
coverage for real property and equipment acquired with HHS funds as 
provided to other property owned by the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 74.32  Real property.

    (a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to 
the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the 
authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the HHS awarding agency.
    (b) The recipient shall obtain written approval from the HHS 
awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-
sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no 
longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other 
projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects 
(i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those 
authorized for support by the HHS awarding agency.
    (c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall request 
disposition instructions from the HHS awarding agency or its successor. 
The HHS awarding agency must provide one or more of the following 
disposition instructions:
    (1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further 
obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal share in the project.
    (2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under 
guidelines provided by the HHS awarding agency and pay the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal share in the project (after 
deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, 
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required 
to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property 
to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, 
in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its 
attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 74.33  Federally-owned and exempt property.

    (a)(1) Title of federally-owned property remains vested in the 
Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory 
listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the HHS awarding 
agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer 
needed, the recipient shall report the property to the HHS awarding 
agency for further agency utilization.
    (2) If the HHS awarding agency has no further need for the property, 
it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services 
Administration, unless the HHS awarding agency has statutory authority 
to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority 
provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C.

[[Page 218]]

3710(I), to donate research equipment to educational and nonprofit 
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and 
Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals''). 
Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the HHS 
awarding agency.
    (b) For research awards to certain types of recipients, 31 U.S.C. 
6306 authorizes HHS to vest title to property acquired with Federal 
funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal 
government and under conditions that HHS considers appropriate. Such 
property is ``exempt property''. Exempt property shall not be subject to 
the requirements of Sec. 74.34, except that it shall be subject to 
paragraphs (h)(1), (2), and (4) of that section concerning the HHS 
awarding agency's right to require transfer.

[59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 11747, Mar. 22, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 74.34  Equipment.

    (a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with HHS funds shall 
vest in the recipient, subject to the conditions of this section.
    (b)(1) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with HHS funds 
to provide services to non-Federal organizations for a fee that is less 
than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless 
specifically authorized by Federal statute, for so long as the Federal 
Government retains an interest in the equipment.
    (2) If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on 
other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be 
permissible if authorized by the HHS awarding agency.
    (3) User charges shall be treated as program income, in keeping with 
the provisions of Sec. 74.24.
    (c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program 
for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project 
or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the HHS awarding agency. When 
no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient 
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored 
activities, if any, in the following order of priority:
    (1) Programs, projects, or activities sponsored by the HHS awarding 
agency;
    (2) Programs, projects, or activities sponsored by other HHS 
awarding agencies; then
    (3) Programs, project, or activities sponsored by other Federal 
agencies.
    (d) During the time that equipment is used on the program, project, 
or activity for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it 
available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will 
not interfere with the work on the program, project, or activity for 
which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such 
other use shall be given to other programs, projects, or activities 
sponsored by the HHS awarding agency. Second preference shall be given 
to programs, projects, or activities sponsored by other HHS awarding 
agencies. Third preference shall be given to programs, projects, or 
activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.
    (e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the 
equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the 
proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the 
approval of the HHS awarding agency.
    (f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment 
acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include 
all of the following:
    (1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall 
include the following information:
    (i) A description of the equipment;
    (ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock 
number, national stock number, or other identification number;
    (iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number;
    (iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government;
    (v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was 
furnished by the Federal Government) and cost;
    (vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of 
HHS's share in the cost of the equipment (not

[[Page 219]]

applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government);
    (vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the 
information was reported;
    (viii) Unit acquisition cost; and
    (ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales 
price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a 
recipient compensates the HHS awarding agency for its share.
    (2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to 
indicate Federal ownership.
    (3) The recipient shall take a physical inventory of equipment and 
the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every 
two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical 
inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be 
investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient 
shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current 
utilization, and continued need for the equipment.
    (4) recipient shall maintain a control system to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, 
damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully 
documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the 
recipient shall promptly notify the HHS awarding agency.
    (5) The recipient shall implement adequate maintenance procedures to 
keep the equipment in good condition.
    (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the 
equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide 
for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest 
possible return.
    (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, it may use the 
equipment for other activities in accordance with the following 
standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of 
$5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses 
provided that compensation is made to the original HHS awarding agency 
or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by 
applying the percentage of HHS's share in the cost of the original 
project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If 
the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request 
disposition instructions from the HHS awarding agency; such instructions 
must be issued to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after 
the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern:
    (1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued 
within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient 
shall sell the equipment and reimburse the HHS awarding agency an amount 
computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of HHS share 
in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient 
shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the HHS share $500 or ten 
percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling 
and handling expenses.
    (2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, 
the recipient shall be reimbursed by the HHS awarding agency by an 
amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's 
share in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair 
market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim 
storage costs incurred.
    (3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the 
equipment, the recipient will be reimbursed by the HHS awarding agency 
for such costs incurred in its disposition.
    (4) If the recipient's project or program for which or under which 
the equipment was acquired is still receiving support from the same HHS 
program, and if the HHS awarding agency approves, the net amount due may 
be used for allowable costs of that project or program. Otherwise the 
net amount must be remitted to the HHS awarding agency by check.
    (h) The HHS awarding agency reserves the right to order the transfer 
of title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the 
awarding agency when such third party is otherwise eligible under 
existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following 
standards:

[[Page 220]]

    (1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or 
otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
    (2) The HHS awarding agency may require submission of a final 
inventory that lists all equipment acquired with HHS funds and 
federally-owned equipment.
    (3) If the HHS awarding agency fails to issue disposition 
instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of the inventory, 
the recipient shall apply the standards of paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section as appropriate.
    (4) When the HHS awarding agency exercises its right to order the 
transfer of title to the Federal Government, the equipment shall be 
subject to the rules for federally-owned equipment. (See Sec. 74.34(g)).

[59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 11747, Mar. 22, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 74.35  Supplies.

    (a) Title to supplies shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. 
If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in 
total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or 
program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-
sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies 
for use on non-federally sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, 
in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The 
amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for 
equipment. (See Sec. 74.34(g)).
    (b)(1) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal 
funds to provide services to non-Federal organizations for a fee that is 
less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless 
specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal 
Government retains an interest in the supplies.
    (2) If the supplies are owned by the Federal Government, use on 
other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be 
permissible if authorized by the HHS awarding agency.
    (3) User charges shall be treated as program income, in keeping with 
the provisions of Sec. 74.24.

[59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 11747, Mar. 22, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 74.36  Intangible property.

    (a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to 
copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under 
an award. The HHS awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive 
and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work 
for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
    (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing 
patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations issued by 
the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (c) The Federal Government has the right to:
    (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first 
produced under an award; and
    (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use such data for Federal purposes.
    (d)(1) In addition, in response to a Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) request for research data relating to published research findings 
produced under an award that were used by the Federal Government in 
developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the 
HHS Awarding Agency shall request, and the recipient shall provide, 
within a reasonable time, the research data so that they can be made 
available to the public through the procedures established under the 
FOIA. If the HHS Awarding Agency obtains the research data solely in 
response to a FOIA request, the agency may charge the requester a 
reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the 
research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred by the agency, the 
recipient, and applicable subrecipients. This fee is in addition to any 
fees the agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).

[[Page 221]]

    (2) The following definitions apply for purposes of this paragraph 
(d):
    (i) Research data is defined as the recorded factual material 
commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate 
research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, 
drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or 
communications with colleagues. This ``recorded'' material excludes 
physical objects (e.g., laboratory samples). Research data also do not 
include:
    (A) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be 
held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar 
information which is protected under law; and
    (B) Personnel and medical information and similar information the 
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a 
particular person in a research study.
    (ii) Published is defined as either when:
    (A) Research findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or 
technical journal; or
    (B) A Federal agency publicly and officially cites the research 
findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of 
law.
    (iii) Used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action 
that has the force and effect of law is defined as when an agency 
publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an 
agency action that has the force and effect of law.
    (3) The requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
do not apply to commercial organizations.
    (e) Title to intangible property and debt instruments purchased or 
otherwise acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in 
the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-
-authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property 
without approval of the HHS awarding agency. When no longer needed for 
the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible 
property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 74.34 (g) 
and (h).

[59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 65 FR 14407, 14418, Mar. 16, 
2000]


<R05>
Sec. 74.37  Property trust relationship.

    Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments 
that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust 
by the recipients as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or 
program under which the property was acquired or improved, and shall not 
be encumbered without the approval of the HHS awarding agency. 
Recipients shall record liens or other appropriate notices of record to 
indicate that real property has been acquired or constructed or, where 
applicable, improved with Federal funds, and that use and disposition 
conditions apply to the property.

                          Procurement Standards


<R05>
Sec. 74.40  Purpose of procurement standards.

    Sections 74.41 through 74.48 set forth standards for use by 
recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies 
and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other 
services with Federal funds. These standards are established to ensure 
that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and 
in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and 
executive orders. The standards apply where the cost of the procurement 
is treated as a direct cost of an award.


<R05>
Sec. 74.41  Recipient responsibilities.

    The standards contained in this section do not relieve the 
recipients of the contractual responsibilities arising under its 
contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without 
recourse to the HHS awarding agency, regarding the settlement and 
satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of 
procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. 
This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or 
other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of 
statute are to be referred

[[Page 222]]

to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper 
jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 74.42  Codes of conduct.

    The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing 
the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration 
of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the 
selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal 
funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such 
a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, or any 
member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an 
organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties 
indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected 
for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients 
may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not 
substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The 
standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be 
applied for violations of such standards by officers, employers, or 
agents of the recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 74.43  Competition.

    All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to 
provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The 
recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well 
as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or 
eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure 
objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive 
advantage, contractors that develop or draft grant applications, or 
contract specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations 
for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing 
for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror 
whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most 
advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors 
considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that 
the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be 
evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected 
when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 74.44  Procurement procedures.

    (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. 
These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that:
    (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items;
    (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase 
alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and 
practical procurement for the recipient and the Federal Government; and
    (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the 
following:
    (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements 
for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive 
procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly 
restrict competition.
    (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all 
other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements 
in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including 
the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
    (iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions 
that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the 
solicitation.
    (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of 
measurement.
    (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and 
protect the environment and are energy efficient.
    (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small 
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, 
whenever possible. Recipients of HHS awards shall

[[Page 223]]

take all of the following steps to further this goal.
    (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's 
business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.
    (2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and 
arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and 
facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and 
women's business enterprises.
    (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for 
larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-
owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
    (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, 
minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is 
too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
    (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such 
organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of 
Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and 
utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's 
business enterprises.
    (c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price 
contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive 
contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate 
for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of 
the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' 
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not 
be used.
    (d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who 
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms 
and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given 
to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, 
financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary 
resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are 
restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, 
``Debarment and Suspension.'' (See 45 CFR part 76.)
    (e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the HHS 
awarding agency, pre-award review, procurement documents such as 
requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost 
estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply:
    (1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to 
comply with the procurement standards in this Part.
    (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $100,000) and is to be 
awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in 
response to a solicitation.
    (3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold specifies a ``brand name'' product.
    (4) The proposed award over the simplified acquisition threshold is 
to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid 
procurement.
    (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the 
simplified acquisition threshold.

62 FR 41878, Aug. 4, 1997; 62 FR 51377, Oct. 1, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 74.45  Cost and price analysis.

    Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in 
the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price 
analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison 
of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, 
together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of 
each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and 
allowability.


<R05>
Sec. 74.46  Procurement records.

    Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the 
simplified acquisition threshold shall include the following at a 
minimum: (a) Basis for contractor selection, (b) justification

[[Page 224]]

for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not 
obtained, and (c) basis for award cost or price.

[59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 41878, Aug. 4, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 74.47  Contract administration.

    A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure 
contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of 
the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all 
purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and 
document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, 
conditions and specifications of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 74.48  Contract provisions.

    The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a 
sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. 
The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts:
    (a) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold 
shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for 
administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a 
contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such 
remedial actions as may be appropriate.
    (b) All contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold 
(currently $100,000) shall contain suitable provisions for termination 
by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be 
effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall 
describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for 
default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated 
because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
    (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires 
the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility 
improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own 
requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment 
bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. 
For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the HHS awarding 
agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, 
provided the HHS awarding agency has made a determination that the 
Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a 
determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as 
follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance 
of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies 
Doing Business with the United States.''
    (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the 
simplified acquisition threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a 
provision to the effect that the recipient, the HHS awarding agency, the 
U.S. Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized 
representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific 
program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and 
transcriptions.
    (e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients 
and

[[Page 225]]

their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of appendix A 
to this part, as applicable.

                           Reports and Records


<R05>
Sec. 74.50  Purpose of reports and records.

    Sections 74.51 through 74.53 set forth the procedures for monitoring 
and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and 
the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record 
retention requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 74.51  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each 
project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. 
Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure that subrecipients have met 
the audit requirements as set forth in Sec. 74.26.
    (b) The HHS awarding agency will prescribe the frequency with which 
the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports will not be required 
more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual 
reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the award year; quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
HHS awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary 
dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final 
performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or 
termination of the award.
    (c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report will 
not be required after completion of the project.
    (d) Performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, 
brief information on each of the following:
    (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and 
objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, 
or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can 
be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost 
data for computation of unit costs.
    (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
    (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (e) Recipients shall submit the original and two copies of 
performance reports.
    (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the HHS awarding agency of 
developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported 
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, 
delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to 
meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a 
statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed 
to resolve the situation.
    (g) HHS may make site visits, as needed.
    (h) The HHS awarding agency complies with the applicable report 
clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling Paperwork 
Burdens on the Public,'' when requesting performance data from 
recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 74.52  Financial reporting.

    (a) The following forms are used for obtaining financial information 
from recipients:
    (1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report.
    (i) The HHS awarding agency will require recipients to use either 
the SF-269 (long form) or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all 
nonconstruction projects or programs. The SF-269 shall always be used if 
income has been earned. The awarding agency may, however, waive the SF-
269 or SF-269A requirement when the PMS-270, Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement, or PMS-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, will 
provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF-
269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when 
the PMS-270 is used only for advances.
    (ii) If the HHS awarding agency requires accrual information and the 
recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual 
basis, the

[[Page 226]]

recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but 
shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on 
an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (iii) The HHS awarding agency will determine the frequency of the 
Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the 
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the 
report will not be required more frequently than quarterly or less 
frequently than annually except under Sec. 74.14. A final report shall 
be required at the completion of the agreement.
    (iv) Recipients shall submit the SF-269 and SF-269A (an original and 
two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified 
reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar 
days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may 
be approved by the HHS awarding agency upon request of the recipient.
    (2) PMS-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.
    (i) When funds are advanced to recipients, the HHS awarding agency 
requires each recipient to submit the PMS-272 and, when necessary, its 
continuation sheet, PMS-272A through G. The HHS awarding agency uses 
this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain 
disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.
    (ii) The HHS awarding agency may require forecasts of Federal cash 
requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.
    (iii) Recipients shall submit the original and two copies of the 
PMS-272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. The HHS 
awarding agency may require a monthly report from those recipients 
receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.
    (iv) The HHS awarding agency may waive the requirement for 
submission of the PMS-272 for any one of the following reasons: (A) When 
monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such 
advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section; 
(B) If, in HHS' opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are 
adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or, (C) When the 
electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
    (b) When the HHS awarding agency needs additional information or 
more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.
    (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative 
requirements, the HHS awarding agency will issue instructions to require 
recipients to submit that information under the ``Remarks'' section of 
the reports.
    (2) When HHS determines that a recipient's accounting system does 
not meet the standards in Sec. 74.21, additional pertinent information 
to further monitor awards may be obtained, without regard to Sec. 74.4, 
upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is 
brought up to standard. In obtaining this information, the HHS awarding 
agencies comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, 
``Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public.''
    (3) The HHS awarding agency may accept the identical information 
from a recipient in machine readable format or computer printouts or 
electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
    (4) The HHS awarding agency may provide computer or electronic 
outputs to recipients when such action expedites or contributes to the 
accuracy of reporting.


<R05>
Sec. 74.53  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and 
access to records for awards to recipients.
    (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, 
and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a 
period of three years from the date of submission of the final 
expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or 
annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual 
financial report. The only exceptions are the following:
    (1) If any litigation, claim, financial management review, or audit 
is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall 
be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings

[[Page 227]]

involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.
    (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal 
funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
    (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the HHS 
awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to 
the recipient.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as 
specified in Sec. 74.53(g).
    (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original 
records if authorized by the HHS awarding agency.
    (d) The HHS awarding agency will request transfer of certain records 
to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records 
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate 
recordkeeping, the HHS awarding agency may make arrangements for 
recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint 
use.
    (e) HHS awarding agencies, the HHS Inspector General, the U.S. 
Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, 
have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, 
documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to 
the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts 
and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and 
reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of 
interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access 
in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but 
shall last as long as records are retained.
    (f) Unless required by statute, the HHS awarding agency will not 
place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records 
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the HHS 
awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept 
confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, if the records had 
belonged to the HHS awarding agency.
    (g) Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the 
following types of documents, and their supporting records: Indirect 
cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any 
similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group 
of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or 
composite fringe benefit rates).
    (1) If the recipient submits to the Federal Government or the 
subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other 
computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of 
such submission.
    (2) If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal 
Government or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the 
recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation 
purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or 
other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the 
fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, 
or other computation.

                       Termination and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 74.60  Purpose of termination and enforcement.

    Sections 74.61 and 74.62 set forth uniform suspension, termination 
and enforcement procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 74.61  Termination.

    (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph 
(a) (1), (2), or (3) of this section applies.
    (1) By the HHS awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to 
comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
    (2) By the HHS awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in 
which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, 
including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, 
the portion to be terminated.
    (3) By the recipient upon sending to the HHS awarding agency written 
notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However,

[[Page 228]]

if the HHS awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination 
that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish 
the purposes for which the award was made, it may terminate the award in 
its entirety.
    (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the 
recipient referred to in Sec. 74.71(a), including those for property 
management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the 
award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of 
the recipient after termination, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 74.62  Enforcement.

    (a) If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and 
conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute or 
regulation, an assurance, an application, or a notice of award, the HHS 
awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special 
conditions outlined in Sec. 74.14, take one or more of the following 
actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the HHS 
awarding agency.
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable 
matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action 
not in compliance.
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
    (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
    (5) Take any other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) In taking an enforcement action, the HHS awarding agency will 
provide the recipient or subrecipient an opportunity for such hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient or 
subrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action. (See also 45 CFR parts 16 and 95.)
    (c) Costs to a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the 
recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the HHS awarding agency expressly authorizes them in 
the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient 
costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not 
reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, 
are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are 
noncancellable; and
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including 
suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being 
subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the 
HHS implementing regulations at Sec. 74.13 of this part and 45 CFR part 
76.

<R05>
Sec. 74.70  Purpose.

    Sections 74.71 through 74.73 contain closeout procedures and other 
procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 74.71  Closeout procedures.

    (a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date 
of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other 
reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The HHS 
awarding agency may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.
    (b) Unless the HHS awarding agency authorizes an extension, a 
recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not 
later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of 
completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in 
agency implementing instructions.

[[Page 229]]

    (c) HHS will make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable 
reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.
    (d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated 
cash that HHS has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be 
retained by the recipient for use in other projects. 45 CFR part 30

will make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the 
Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.
    (f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property 
acquired with HHS funds or received from the Federal Government in 
accordance with Sec.Sec. 74.31 through 74.37.
    (g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the 
closeout of an award, HHS retains the right to recover an appropriate 
amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs 
resulting from the final audit.


<R05>
Sec. 74.72  Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

    (a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following:
    (1) The right of the HHS awarding agency to disallow costs and 
recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
    (2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a 
result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.

    (4) Property management requirements in Sec.Sec. 74.31 through 
74.37.
    (5) Records retention requirements in Sec. 74.53.
    (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an 
award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of 
the HHS awarding agency and the recipient, provided the responsibilities 
of the recipient referred to in Sec. 74.72(a), including those for 
property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made 
for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 74.73  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which 
the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and 
conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If 
not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the 
HHS awarding agency may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2), or 
(3) of this section:
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements.
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due the recipient.
    (3) Taking other action permitted by statute.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, HHS awarding agencies will 
charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR ch. II, 
``Federal Claims Collection Standards.'' (See 45 CFR part 30.)

    Source: 59 FR 43760, Aug. 25, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 74.90  Final decisions in disputes.

    (a) HHS attempts to promptly issue final decisions in disputes and 
in other matters affecting the interests of recipients. However, final 
decisions adverse to the recipient are not issued until it is clear that 
the matter cannot be resolved through further exchange of information 
and views.
    (b) Under various HHS statutes or regulations, recipients have the 
right to appeal from, or to have a hearing on, certain final decisions 
by HHS awarding agencies. (See, for example, subpart D of 42 CFR part 
50, and 45 CFR part 16). Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section set 
forth the standards HHS expects its member agencies to meet in issuing a 
final decision covered by any of the statutes or regulations.
    (c) The decision may be brief but must contain:
    (1) A complete statement of the background and basis of the awarding 
agency's decision, including reference to the pertinent statutes, 
regulations, or other governing documents; and
    (2) Enough information to enable the recipient to understand the 
issues and the position of the HHS awarding agency.
    (d) The following or similar language (consistent with the 
terminology of the applicable statutes or regulations) should appear at 
the end of the decision: ``This is the final decision of the (title of 
grants officer or other official responsible for the decision). It shall 
be the final decision of the Department unless, within 30 days after 
receiving this decision, you deliver or mail (you should use registered 
or certified mail to establish the date) a written notice of appeal to 
(name and address of appropriate contact, e.g., the office responsible 
for awarding agency preliminary appeal process or, where none, the 
Departmental Appeals Board, Department of Health and Human Services, 
Washington, DC 20201). You shall attach to the notice a copy of this 
decision, note that you intend an appeal, state the amount in dispute, 
and briefly state why you think that this decision is wrong. You will be 
notified of further procedures.''

<R05>
Sec. 74.91  Alternative dispute resolution.

    HHS encourages its awarding agencies and recipients to try to 
resolve disputes by using alternative dispute resolution (ADR) 
techniques. ADR often is effective in reducing the cost, delay and 
contentiousness involved in appeals and other traditional ways of 
handling disputes. ADR techniques include mediation, neutral evaluation 
and other consensual methods. Information about ADR is available from 
the HHS Dispute Resolution Specialist at the Departmental Appeals Board, 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC 20201.

               Appendix A to Part 74--Contract Provisions

    All contracts awarded by a recipient, including small purchases, 
shall contain the following provisions as applicable where the cost of 
the contract is treated as a direct cost of an award:
    1. Equal Employment Opportunity-- All contracts shall contain a 
provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246, ``Equal Employment 
Opportunity,'' as amended by E.O. 11375, ``Amending Executive Order 
11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented by 
regulations at 41 CFR part 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.''
    2. Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 
276c)-- All contracts and subgrants in excess of $2,000 for construction 
or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients shall include a

U.S.C. 874, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations, 29 CFR 
part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public 
Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from

[[Page 231]]

the United States.'' The Act provides that each contractor or 
subrecipient shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person 
employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to 
give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. 
The recipient shall report all suspected or reported violations to the 
Federal awarding agency.
    3. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)-- When 
required by Federal program legislation, all construction contracts 
awarded by the recipients and subrecipients of more than $2000 shall 
include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 
276a to a-7, and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations, 29 
CFR part 5, ``Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts 
Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction.'' Under this 
Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and 
mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage 
determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors 
shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The recipient 
shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued 
by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a 
contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage 
determination. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported 
violations to the HHS awarding agency.
    4. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333)-
- Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of 
$100,000 for construction contracts and for other contracts that involve

compliance with sections 102 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and 
Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. 327-333, as supplemented by Department 
of Labor regulations, 29 CFR part 5. Under section 102 of the Act, each 
contractor shall be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and 
laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess 
of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is 
compensated at a rate of not less than 1\1/2\ times the basic rate of 
pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. Section 
107 of the Act is applicable to construction work and provides that no 
laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under 
working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These 
requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or 
articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for 
transportation or transmission of intelligence.

Agency.
    7. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)-- Contractors who 
apply or bid for an award of more than $100,000 shall file the required 
certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not 
and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or 
organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or 
employee of any Federal agency, a member of Congress, officer or 
employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in 
connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award 
covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying 
with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any 
Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to 
the recipient. (See also 45 CFR part 93).
    8. Debarment and Suspension (E.O.s 12549 and 12689)-- Certain

                  Appendixes B-D to Part 74 [Reserved]

 Appendix E to Part 74--Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to 
   Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts With Hospitals

                          i. purpose and scope

    A. Objectives. This appendix provides principles for determining the 
costs applicable to research and development work performed by hospitals 
under grants and contracts with the Department of Health and Human 
Services. These principles are confined to the subject of cost 
determination and make no attempt to identify the circumstances or 
dictate the extent of hospital participation in the financing of a 
particular research or development project. The principles are designed 
to provide recognition of the full allocated costs of such research work 
under generally accepted accounting principles. These principles will be 
applicable to both proprietary and non-profit hospitals. No provision 
for profit or other increment above cost is provided for in these 
principles. However, this is not to be interpreted as precluding a 
negotiated fee between contracting parties when a fee is appropriate.
    B. Policy guides. The successful application of these principles 
requires development of mutual understanding between representatives of 
hospitals and of the Department of Health and Human Services as to their 
scope, applicability and interpretation. It is recognized that:
    1. The arrangements for hospital participation in the financing of a 
research and development project are properly subject to negotiation 
between the agency and the hospital concerned in accordance with such 
Government-wide criteria as may be applicable.
    2. Each hospital, possessing its own unique combination of staff, 
facilities and experience, should be encouraged to conduct research in a 
manner consonant with its own institutional philosophies and objectives.
    3. Each hospital in the fulfillment of its contractual obligations 
should be expected to employ sound management practices.
    4. The application of the principles established herein shall be in 
conformance with the generally accepted accounting practices of 
hospitals.
    5. Hospitals receive reimbursements from the Federal Government for 
differing types of services under various programs such as support of 
Research and Development (including discrete clinical centers) Health 
Services Projects, Medicare, etc. It is essential that consistent 
procedures for determining reimbursable costs for similar services be 
employed without regard to program differences. Therefore, both the 
direct and indirect costs of research programs must be identified as a 
cost center(s) for the cost finding and step-down requirements of the 
Medicare program, or in its absence the Medicaid program.
    C. Application. All operating agencies within the Department of 
Health and Human Services that sponsor research and development work in 
hospitals will apply these principles and related policy guides in 
determining the costs incurred for such work under grants and cost-
reimbursement type contracts and subcontracts. These principles will 
also be used as a guide in the pricing of fixed-price contracts and 
subcontracts.

                        ii. definitions of terms

    A. Organized research means all research activities of a hospital 
that may be identified whether the support for such research is from a 
federal, non-federal or internal source.
    B. Departmental research means research activities that are not 
separately budgeted and accounted for. Such work, which includes all 
research activities not encompassed under the term organized research, 
is regarded for purposes of this document as a part of the patient care 
activities of the hospital.
    C. Research agreement means any valid arrangement to perform 
federally-sponsored research or development including grants, cost-
reimbursement type contracts, cost-reimbursement type subcontracts, and 
fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.
    D. Instruction and training means the formal or informal programs of 
educating and training technical and professional health services 
personnel, primarily medical and nursing training. This activity, if 
separately budgeted or identifiable with specific costs, should be 
considered as a cost objective for purposes of indirect cost allocations 
and the development of patient care costs.
    E. Other hospital activities means all organized activities of a 
hospital not immediately related to the patient care, research, and 
instructional and training functions which produce identifiable revenue 
from the performance of these activities. If a non-related activity does 
not produce identifiable revenue, it may be necessary to allocate this 
expense using an appropriate basis. In such a case, the activity may be 
included as an allocable cost (See paragraph III D below.) Also included 
under this definition is any category of cost treated as 
``Unallowable,'' provided such category of cost identifies a function or 
activity to which a portion of the institution's indirect cost (as 
defined in paragraph V. A.) are properly allocable.
    F. Patient care means those departments or cost centers which render 
routine or ancillary services to in-patients and/or out-patients. As 
used in paragraph IX B.23, it

[[Page 233]]

means the cost of these services applicable to patients involved in 
research programs.
    G. Allocation means the process by which the indirect costs are 
assigned as between:
    1. Organized research,
    2. Patient care including departmental research.
    3. Instruction and training, and
    4. Other hospital activities.
    H. Cost center means an identifiable department or area (including 
research) within the hospital which has been assigned an account number 
in the hospital accounting system for the purpose of accumulating 
expense by department or area.
    I. Cost finding is the process of recasting the data derived from 
the accounts ordinarily kept by a hospital to ascertain costs of the 
various types of services rendered. It is the determination of direct 
costs by specific identification and the proration of indirect costs by 
allocation.
    J. Step down is a cost finding method that recognizes that services 
rendered by certain nonrevenue-producing departments or centers are 
utilized by certain other nonrevenue producing centers as well as by the 
revenue-producing centers. All costs of nonrevenue-producing centers are 
allocated to all centers which they serve, regardless of whether or not 
these centers produce revenue. Following the apportionment of the cost 
of the nonrevenue-producing center, that center will be considered 
closed and no further costs are apportioned to that center.
    K. Scatter bed is a bed assigned to a research patient based on 
availability. Research patients occupying these beds are not physically 
segregated from nonresearch patients occupying beds. Scatter beds are 
geographically dispersed among all the beds available for use in the 
hospital. There are no special features attendant to a scatter bed that 
distinguishes it from others that could just as well have been occupied.
    L. Discrete bed is a bed or beds that have been set aside for 
occupancy by research patients and are physically segregated from other 
hospital beds in an environment that permits an easily ascertainable 
allocation of costs associated with the space they occupy and the 
services they generate.

                        iii. basic considerations

    A. Composition of total costs. The cost of a research agreement is 
comprised of the allowable direct costs incident to its performance plus 
the allocable portion of the allowable indirect costs of the hospital 
less applicable credits. (See paragraph III-E.)
    B. Factors affecting allowability of costs. The tests of 
allowability of costs under these principles are:
    1. They must be reasonable.
    2. They must be assigned to research agreements under the standards 
and methods provided herein.
    3. They must be accorded consistent treatment through application of 
those generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the 
circumstances (See paragraph I-E.5.) and
    4. They must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in 
these principles or in the research agreement as to types or amounts of 
cost items.
    C. Reasonable costs. A cost may be considered reasonable if the 
nature of the goods or services acquired or applied, and the amount 
involved therefor reflect the action that a prudent person would have 
taken under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision to 
incur the cost was made. Major considerations involved in the 
determination of the reasonableness of a cost are:
    1. Whether or not the cost is of a type generally recognized as 
necessary for the operation of the hospital or the performance of the 
research agreement,
    2. The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as arm's 
length bargaining, federal and state laws and regulations, and research 
agreement terms and conditions,
    3. Whether or not the individuals concerned acted with due prudence 
in the circumstances, considering their responsibilities to the 
hospital, its patients, its employees, its students, the Government, and 
the public at large, and
    4. The extent to which the actions taken with respect to the 
incurrence of the cost are consistent with established hospital policies 
and practices applicable to the work of the hospital generally, 
including Government research.
    D. Allocable costs. 1. A cost is allocable to a particular cost 
center (i.e., a specific function, project, research agreement, 
department, or the like) if the goods or services involved are 
chargeable or assignable to such cost center in accordance with relative 
benefits received or other equitable relationship. Subject to the 
foregoing, a cost is allocable to a research agreement if it is incurred 
solely to advance the work under the research agreement; or it benefits 
both the research agreement and other work of the hospital in 
proportions that can be approximated through use of reasonable methods; 
or it is necessary to the overall operation of the hospital and, in 
light of the standards provided in this chapter, is deemed to be 
assignable in part to organized research. Where the purchase of 
equipment or other capital items are specifically authorized under a 
research agreement, the amounts thus authorized for such purchases are 
allocable to the research agreement regardless of the use that may 
subsequently be made of the equipment or other capital items involved.
    2. Any costs allocable to a particular research agreement under the 
standards provided in these principles may not be shifted to other 
research agreements in order to

[[Page 234]]

meet deficiencies caused by overruns or other fund considerations, to 
avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of the research agreement, 
or for other reasons of convenience.
    E. Applicable credits. 1. The term applicable credits refers to 
those receipts or negative expenditure types of transactions which 
operate to offset or reduce expense items that are allocable to research 
agreements as direct or indirect costs as outlined in paragraph V-A. 
Typical examples of such transactions are: purchase discounts, rebates, 
or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; sales of scrap or 
incidental services; tuition; adjustments of overpayments or erroneous 
charges; and services rendered to patients admitted to federally funded 
clinical research centers, primarily for care though also participating 
in research protocols.
    2. In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal 
Government to finance hospital activities or service operations should 
be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting 
such credit items against related expenditures should be applied by the 
hospital in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to government 
research for services rendered whenever the facilities or other 
resources used in providing such services have been financed directly, 
in whole or in part, by federal funds. Thus, where such items are 
provided for or benefit a particular hospital activity, i.e., patient 
care, research, instruction and training, or other, they should be 
treated as an offset to the indirect costs apportioned to that activity. 
Where the benefits are common to all hospital activities they should be 
treated as a credit to the total indirect cost pool before allocation to 
the various cost objectives.

                            iv. direct costs

    A. General. Direct costs are those that can be identified 
specifically with a particular cost center. For this purpose, the term 
cost center refers not only to the ultimate centers against which costs 
are finally lodged such as research agreements, but also to other 
established cost centers such as the individual accounts for recording 
particular objects or items of expense, and the separate account 
groupings designed to record the expenses incurred by individual 
organizational units, functions, projects and the like. In general, the 
administrative functions and service activities described in paragraph 
VI are identifiable as separate cost centers, and the expenses 
associated with such centers become eligible in due course for 
distribution as indirect costs of research agreements and other ultimate 
cost centers.
    B. Application to research agreements. Identifiable benefit to the 
research work rather than the nature of the goods and services involved 
is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect costs 
of research agreements. Typical of transactions chargeable to a research 
agreement as direct costs are the compensation of employees for the time 
or effort devoted to the performance of work under the research 
agreement, including related staff benefit and pension plan costs to the 
extent that such items are consistently accorded to all employees and 
treated by the hospital as direct rather than indirect costs (see 
paragraph V. B4b); the costs of materials consumed or expended in the 
performance of such work; and other items of expense incurred for the 
research agreement, such as extraordinary utility consumption. The cost 
of materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized 
facilities or other institutional service operations may be included as 
direct costs of research agreements provided such items are consistently 
treated by the institution as direct rather than indirect costs and are 
charged under a recognized method of costing or pricing designed to 
recover only the actual direct and indirect costs of such material or 
service and conforming to generally accepted cost accounting practices 
consistently followed by the institution.

                            v. indirect costs

    A. General. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for 
common or joint objectives, and thus are not readily subject to 
treatment as direct costs of research agreements or other ultimate or 
revenue producing cost centers. In hospitals such costs normally are 
classified but not necessarily restricted to the following functional 
categories: Depreciation; Administrative and General (including fringe 
benefits if not charged directly); Operation of Plant; Maintenance of 
Plant; Laundry and Linen Service; Housekeeping; Dietary; Maintenance of 
Personnel; and Medical Records and Library.
    B. Criteria for distribution--1. Base period. A base period for 
distribution of indirect costs is the period during which such costs are 
incurred and accumulated for distribution to work performed within that 
period. The base period normally should coincide with the fiscal year 
established by the hospital, but in any event the base period should be 
so selected as to avoid inequities in the distribution of costs.
    2. Need for cost groupings. The overall objective of the allocation 
process is to distribute the indirect costs described in paragraph VI to 
organized research, patient care, instruction and training, and other 
hospital activities in reasonable proportions consistent with the nature 
and extent of the use of the hospital's resources by research personnel, 
medical staff, patients, students, and other personnel or organizations. 
In order to

[[Page 235]]

achieve this objective with reasonable precision, it may be necessary to 
provide for selective distribution by establishing separate groupings of 
cost within one or more of the functional categories of indirect costs 
referred to in paragraph V-A. In general, the cost groupings established 
within a functional category should constitute, in each case, a pool of 
those items of expense that are considered to be of like character in 
terms of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from) 
the particular cost centers to which distribution is appropriate. Each 
such pool or cost grouping should then be distributed individually to 
the related cost centers, using the distribution base or method most 
appropriate in the light of the guides set out in B3 below. While this 
paragraph places primary emphasis on a step-down method of indirect cost 
computation, paragraph VIII provides an alternate method which may be 
used under certain conditions.
    3. Selection of distribution method. Actual conditions must be taken 
into account in selecting the method or base to be used in distributing 
to related cost centers the expenses assembled under each of the 
individual cost groups established as indicated under B2 above. Where a 
distribution can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to 
the area benefited, the distribution should be made in that manner. Care 
should be given, however, to eliminate similar or duplicative costs from 
any other distribution made to this area. Where the expenses under a 
cost grouping are more general in nature, the distribution to related 
cost centers should be made through use of a selected base which will 
produce results which are equitable to both the Government and the 
hospital. In general, any cost element or cost-related factor associated 
with the hospital's work is potentially adaptable for use as a 
distribution base provided:
    a. It can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other 
quantitative measure (total direct expenditures, direct salaries, 
manhours applied, square feet utilized, hours of usage, number of 
documents processed, population served, and the like); and
    b. It is common to the related cost centers during the base period. 
The essential consideration in selection of the distribution base in 
each instance is that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool 
of costs to related cost centers in accord with the relative benefits 
derived; the traceable cause and effect relationship; or logic and 
reason, where neither benefit nor cause and effect relationship is 
determinable.
    4. General consideration on cost groupings. The extent to which 
separate cost groupings and selective distribution would be appropriate 
at a hospital is a matter of judgment to be determined on a case-by-case 
basis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of two or 
more separate cost groups (based on account classification or analysis) 
within a functional category include but are not limited to the 
following:
    a. Where certain items or categories of expense relate solely to one 
of the major divisions of the hospital (patient care, sponsored 
research, instruction and training, or other hospital activities) or to 
any two but not all, such expenses should be set aside as a separate 
cost grouping for direct assignment or selective distribution in 
accordance with the guides provided in B2 and B3 above.
    b. Where any types of expense ordinary treated as indirect cost as 
outlined in paragraph V-A are charged to research agreements as direct 
costs, the similar type expenses applicable to other activities of the 
institution must through separate cost grouping be excluded from the 
indirect costs allocable to research agreements.
    c. Where it is determined that certain expenses are for the support 
of a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurement 
on a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be set 
aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to 
organized research and other hospital activities.
    d. Where organized activities (including identifiable segments of 
organized research as well as the activities cited in paragraph II-E) 
provide their own purchasing, personnel administration, building 
maintenance, or housekeeping or similar service, the distribution of 
such elements of indirect cost to such activities should be accomplished 
through cost grouping which includes only that portion of central 
indirect costs (such as for overall management) which are properly 
allocable to such activities.
    e. Where the hospital elects to treat as indirect charges the costs 
of pension plans and other staff benefits, such costs should be set 
aside as a separate cost grouping for selective distribution to related 
cost centers, including organized research.
    f. Where the hospital is affiliated with a medical school or some 
other institution which performs organized research on the hospital's 
premises, every effort should be made to establish separate cost 
groupings in the Administrative and General or other applicable category 
which will reasonably reflect the use of services and facilities by such 
research. (See also paragraph VII-A.3)
    5. Materiality. Where it is determined that the use of separate cost 
groupings and selective distribution are necessary to produce equitable 
results, the number of such separate cost groupings within a functional 
category should be held within practical limits, after taking into 
consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of 
precision attainable through less selective methods of distribution.

[[Page 236]]

    C. Administration of limitations on allowances for indirect costs. 
1. Research grants may be subject to laws and/or administrative 
regulations that limit the allowance for indirect costs under each such 
grant to a stated percentage of the direct costs allowed. Agencies that 
sponsor such grants will establish procedures which will assure that:
    a. The terms and amount authorized in each case conform with the 
provisions of paragraphs III, V and IX of these principles as they apply 
to matters involving the consistent treatment and allowability of 
individual items of cost; and
    b. The amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such 
research grant does not exceed the maximum allowable under the 
limitation or the amount otherwise allowable under these principles, 
whichever is the smaller.
    2. Where the actual allowance for indirect costs on any research 
grant must be restricted to the smaller of the two alternative amounts 
referred to in C1 above, such alternative amounts should be determined 
in accordance with the following guides:
    a. The maximum allowable under the limitation should be established 
by applying the stated percentage to a direct cost base which shall 
include all items of expenditure authorized by the sponsoring agency for 
inclusion as part of the total cost for the direct benefit of the work 
under the grant; and
    b. The amount otherwise allowable under these principles should be 
established by applying the current institutional indirect cost rate to 
those elements of direct cost which were included in the base on which 
the rate was computed.
    3. When the maximum amount allowable under a statutory limitation or 
the terms of a research agreement is less than the amount otherwise 
allocable as indirect costs under these principles, the amount not 
recoverable as indirect costs under the research agreement involved may 
not be shifted to other research agreements.

           vi. identification and assignment of indirect costs

    A. Depreciation or use charge. 1. The expenses under this heading 
should include depreciation (as defined in paragraph IX-B.9a) on 
buildings, fixed equipment, and movable equipment, except to the extent 
purchased through federal funds. Where adequate records for the 
recording of depreciation are not available, a use charge may be 
substituted for depreciation (See paragraph IX-B.)
    2. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to 
applicable cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides set forth 
in paragraph V-B, on a basis that gives primary emphasis to (a) space 
utilization with respect to depreciation on buildings and fixed 
equipment; and (b) specific identification of assets and their use with 
respect to movable equipment as it relates to patient care, organized 
research, instruction and training, and other hospital activities. Where 
such records are not sufficient for the purpose of the foregoing, 
reasonable estimates will suffice as a means for effecting distribution 
of the amounts involved.
    B. Administration and general expenses. 1. The expenses under this 
heading are those that have been incurred for the administrative offices 
of the hospital including accounting, personnel, purchasing, information 
centers, telephone expense, and the like which do not relate solely to 
any major division of the institution, i.e., solely to patient care, 
organized research, instruction and training, or other hospital 
activities.
    2. The expenses included in this category may be allocated on the 
basis of total expenditures exclusive of capital expenditures, or 
salaries and wages in situations where the results of the distribution 
made on this basis are deemed to be equitable both to the Government and 
the hospital; otherwise the distribution of Administration and General 
expenses should be made through use of selected bases, applied to 
separate cost groupings established within this category of expenses in 
accordance with the guides set out in paragraph V-B.
    C. Operation of plant. 1. The expenses under this heading are those 
that have been incurred by a central service organization or at the 
departmental level for the administration, supervision, and provision of 
utilities (exclusive of telephone expense) and protective services to 
the physical plant. They include expenses incurred for such items as 
power plant operations, general utility costs, elevator operations, 
protection services, and general parking lots.
    2. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to 
applicable cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided 
in paragraph V-B, on a basis that gives primary emphasis to space 
utilization. The allocations should be developed as follows:
    a. Where actual space and related cost records are available or can 
readily be developed and maintained without significant change in the 
accounting practices, the amount distributed should be based on such 
records;
    b. Where the space and related cost records maintained are not 
sufficient for purposes of the foregoing, a reasonable estimate of the 
proportion of total space assigned to the various costs centers normally 
will suffice as a means for effecting distribution of the amounts 
involved; or
    c. Where it can be demonstrated that an area or volume or space 
basis of allocation is impractical or inequitable, other bases may be 
used provided consideration is given to

[[Page 237]]

the use of facilities by research personnel and others, including 
patients.
    D. Maintenance of plant. 1. The expenses under this heading should 
include:
    a. All salaries and wages pertaining to ordinary repair and 
maintenance work performed by employees on the payroll of the hospital;
    b. All supplies and parts used in the ordinary repairing and 
maintaining of buildings and general equipment; and
    c. Amounts paid to outside concerns for the ordinary repairing and 
maintaining of buildings and general equipment.
    2. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to 
applicable cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided 
in paragraph V-B. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to space 
utilization. The allocations and apportionments should be developed as 
follows:
    a. Where actual space and related cost records are available and can 
readily be developed and maintained without significant change in the 
accounting practices, the amount distributed should be based on such 
records;
    b. Where the space and related cost records maintained are not 
sufficient for purposes of the foregoing, a reasonable estimate of the 
proportion of total space assigned to the various cost centers normally 
will suffice as a means for effecting distribution of the amounts 
involved; or
    c. Where it can be demonstrated that an area or volume of space 
basis of allocation is impractical or inequitable, other basis may be 
used provided consideration is given to the use of facilities by 
research personnel and others, including patients.
    E. Laundry and linen. 1. The expenses under this heading should 
include:
    a. Salaries and wages of laundry department employees, seamstresses, 
clean linen handlers, linen delivery men, etc.;
    b. Supplies used in connection with the laundry operation and all 
linens purchased; and
    c. Amounts paid to outside concerns for purchased laundry and/or 
linen service.
    2. The expense included in this category should be allocated to 
related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in 
paragraph V-B. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to actual pounds 
of linen used. The allocations should be developed as follows:
    a. Where actual poundage and related cost records are available or 
can readily be developed and maintained without significant change in 
the accounting practices, the amount distributed should be based on such 
records;
    b. Where it can be demonstrated that a poundage basis of allocation 
is impractical or inequitable other bases may be used provided 
consideration is given to the use of linen by research personnel and 
others, including patients.
    F. Housekeeping. 1. The expenses under this heading should include:
    a. All salaries and wages of the department head, foreman, maids, 
porters, janitors, wall washers, and other housekeeping employees;
    b. All supplies used in carrying out the housekeeping functions; and
    c. Amounts paid to outside concerns for purchased services such as 
window washing, insect extermination, etc.
    2. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to 
related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in 
paragraph V-B. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to space actually 
serviced by the housekeeping department. The allocations and 
apportionments should be developed as follows:
    a. Where actual space serviced and related cost records are 
available or can readily be developed and maintained without significant 
change in the accounting practices, the amount distributed should be 
based on such records;
    b. Where the space serviced and related cost records maintained are 
not sufficient for purposes of the foregoing, a reasonable estimate of 
the proportion of total space assigned to the various cost centers 
normally will suffice as a means for effecting distribution of the 
amounts of housekeeping expenses involved; or
    c. Where it can be demonstrated that the space serviced basis of 
allocation is impractical or inequitable, other bases may be used 
provided consideration is given to the use of housekeeping services by 
research personnel and others, including patients.
    G. Dietary. 1. These expenses, as used herein, shall mean only the 
subsidy provided by the hospital to its employees including research 
personnel through its cafeteria operation. The hospital must be able to 
demonstrate through the use of proper cost accounting techniques that 
the cafeteria operates at a loss to the benefit of employees.
    2. The reasonable operating loss of a subsidized cafeteria operation 
should be allocated to related cost centers in a manner consistent with 
the guides provided in paragraph V-B. on a basis that gives primary 
emphasis to number of employees.
    H. Maintenance (housing) of personnel. 1. The expenses under this 
heading should include:
    a. The salaries and wages of matrons, clerks, and other employees 
engaged in work in nurses' residences and other employees' quarters;
    b. All supplies used in connection with the operation of such 
dormitories; and
    c. Payments to outside agencies for the rental of houses, 
apartments, or rooms used by hospital personnel.

[[Page 238]]

    2. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to 
related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in 
paragraph V-B. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to employee 
utilization of housing facilities. The allocation should be developed as 
follows:
    a. Appropriate credit should be given for all payments received from 
employees or otherwise to reduce the expense to be allocated;
    b. A net cost per housed employee may then be computed; and
    c. Allocation should be made on a departmental basis based on the 
number of housed employees in each respective department.
    I. Medical records and library. 1. The expenses under this heading 
should include:
    a. The salaries and wages of the records librarian, medical 
librarian, clerks, stenographers, etc.; and
    b. All supplies such as medical record forms, chart covers, filing 
supplies, stationery, medical library books, periodicals, etc.
    2. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to 
related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in 
paragraph V-B. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to a special time 
survey of medical records personnel. If this appears to be impractical 
or inequitable, other bases may be used provided consideration is given 
to the use of these facilities by research personnel and others, 
including patients.

    vii. determination and application of indirect cost rate or rates

    A. Indirect cost pools. 1. Subject to (2) below, indirect costs 
allocated to organized research should be treated as a common pool, and 
the costs in such common pool should be distributed to individual 
research agreements benefiting therefrom on a single rate basis.
    2. In some instances a single rate basis for use on all government 
research at a hospital may not be appropriate since it would not take 
into account those different environmental factors which may affect 
substantially the indirect costs applicable to a particular segment of 
government research at the institution. For this purpose, a particular 
segment of government research may be that performed under a single 
research agreement or it may consist of research under a group of 
research agreements performed in a common environment. The environmental 
factors are not limited to the physical location of the work. Other 
important factors are the level of the administrative support required, 
the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific 
disciplines or technical skills involved, the organizational 
arrangements used, or any combination thereof. Where a particular 
segment of government research is performed within an environment which 
appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, 
provision should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to 
such work. An example of this differential may be in the development of 
a separate indirect cost pool for a clinical research center grant. The 
separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the 
regular distribution process, and the separate indirect cost rate 
resulting therefrom should be utilized provided it is determined that:
    a. Such indirect cost rate differs significantly from that which 
would have obtained under (1) above; and
    b. The volume of research work to which such rate would apply is 
material in relation to other government research at the institution.
    3. It is a common practice for grants or contracts awarded to other 
institutions, typically University Schools of Medicine, to be performed 
on hospital premises. In these cases the hospital should develop a 
separate indirect cost pool applicable to the work under such grants or 
contracts. This pool should be developed by a selective distribution of 
only those indirect cost categories which benefit the work performed by 
the other institution, within the practical limits dictated by available 
data and the materiality of the amounts involved. Hospital costs 
determined to be allocable to grants or contracts awarded to another 
institution may not be recovered as a cost of grants or contracts 
awarded directly to the hospital.
    B. The distribution base. Preferably, indirect costs allocated to 
organized research should be distributed to applicable research 
agreements on the basis of direct salaries and wages. However, where the 
use of salaries and wages results in an inequitable allocation of costs 
to the research agreements, total direct costs or a variation thereof, 
may be used in lieu of salaries and wages. Regardless of the base used, 
an indirect cost rate should be determined for each of the separate 
indirect cost pools developed pursuant to paragraph VII-A. The rate in 
each case should be stated as the percentage which the amount of the 
particular indirect cost pool is of the total direct salaries and wages 
(or other base selected) for all research agreements identified with 
such a pool.
    C. Negotiated lump sum for overhead. A negotiated fixed amount in 
lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate for self-contained or off-
campus research activities where the benefits derived from a hospital's 
indirect services cannot be readily determined. Such amount negotiated 
in lieu of indirect costs will be treated as an offset to the 
appropriate indirect cost pool after allocation to patient care, 
organized research, instruction and training, and other hospital 
activities. The base on which such remaining expenses

[[Page 239]]

are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.
    D. Predetermined overhead rates. The utilization of predetermined 
fixed overhead rates may offer potential advantages in the 
administration of research agreements by facilitating the preparation of 
research budgets and permitting more expeditious close out of the 
agreements when the work is completed. Therefore, to the extent allowed 
by law, consideration may be given to the negotiation of predetermined 
fixed rates in those situations where the cost experience and other 
pertinent factors available are deemed sufficient to enable the 
Government and the hospital to reach a reasonable conclusion as to the 
probable level of the indirect cost rate for the ensuing accounting 
period.

             viii. simplified method for small institutions

    A. General. 1. Where the total direct cost of all government-
sponsored research and development work at a hospital in a year is 
minimal, the use of the abbreviated procedure described in paragraph 
VIII-B below may be acceptable in the determination of allowable 
indirect costs. This method may also be used to initially determine a 
provisional indirect cost rate for hospitals that have not previously 
established a rate. Under this abbreviated procedure, data taken 
directly from the institution's most recent annual financial report and 
immediately available supporting information will be utilized as a basis 
for determining the indirect cost rate applicable to research agreements 
at the institution.
    2. The rigid formula approach provided under the abbreviated 
procedure has limitations which may preclude its use at some hospitals 
either because the minimum data required for this purpose are not 
readily available or because the application of the abbreviated 
procedure to the available data produces results which appear 
inequitable to the Government or the hospital. In any such case, 
indirect costs should be determined through use of the regular procedure 
rather than the abbreviated procedure.
    3. In certain instances where the total direct cost of all 
government-sponsored research and development work at the hospital is 
more than minimal, the abbreviated procedure may be used if prior 
permission is obtained. This alternative will be granted only in those 
cases where it can be demonstrated that the step-down technique cannot 
be followed.
    B. Abbreviated procedure. 1. Total expenditures as taken from the 
most recent annual financial report will be adjusted by eliminating from 
further consideration expenditures for capital items as defined in 
paragraph IX-B.4 and unallowable costs as defined under various headings 
in paragraph IX and paragraph III-E.
    2. Total expenditures as adjusted under the foregoing will then be 
distributed among (a) expenditures applicable to administrative and 
general overhead functions, (b) expenditures applicable to all other 
overhead functions, and (c) expenditures for all other purposes. The 
first group shall include amounts associated with the functional 
categories, Administration and General, and Dietary, as defined in 
paragraph VI. The second group shall include Depreciation, Operation of 
Plant, Maintenance of Plant, and Housekeeping. The third group--
expenditures for all other purposes--shall include the amounts 
applicable to all other activities, namely, patient care, organized 
research, instruction and training, and other hospital activities as 
defined under paragraph II-E. For the purposes of this section, the 
functional categories of Laundry and Linen, Maintenance of Personnel, 
and Medical Records and Library as defined in paragraph VI shall be 
considered as expenditures for all other purposes.
    3. The expenditures distributed to the first two groups in paragraph 
VIII-B.2 should then be adjusted by those receipts or negative 
expenditure types of transactions which tend to reduce expense items 
allocable to research agreements as indirect costs. Examples of such 
receipts or negative expenditures are itemized in paragraph III-E.1.
    4. In applying the procedures in paragraphs VIII-B.1 and B.2, the 
cost of unallowable activities such as Gift Shop, Investment Property 
Management, Fund Raising, and Public Relations, when they benefit from 
the hospital's indirect cost services, should be treated as expenditures 
for all other purposes. Such activities are presumed to benefit from the 
hospital's indirect cost services when they include salaries of 
personnel working in the hospital. When they do not include such 
salaries, they should be eliminated from the indirect cost rate 
computation.
    5. The indirect cost rate will then be computed in two stages. The 
first stage requires the computation of an Administrative and General 
rate component. This is done by applying a ratio of research direct 
costs over total direct costs to the Administrative and General pool 
developed under paragraphs VIII-B.2 and B.3 above. The resultant amount-
-that which is allocable to research--is divided by the direct research 
cost base. The second stage requires the computation of an All Other 
Indirect Cost rate component. This is done by applying a ratio of 
research direct space over total direct space to All Other Indirect Cost 
pool developed under paragraphs VIII-B.2 and B.3 above. The resultant 
amount--that which is allocable to research--is divided by the direct 
research cost base.
    The total of the two rate components will be the institution's 
indirect cost rate. For

[[Page 240]]

the purposes of this section, the research direct cost or space and 
total direct cost or space will be that cost or space identified with 
the functional categories classified under Expenditures for all other 
purposes under paragraph VIII-B.2.

            ix. general standards for selected items of cost

    A. General. This section provides standards to be applied in 
establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining 
cost. These standards should apply irrespective of whether a particular 
item of cost is properly treated as direct cost or indirect cost. 
Failure to mention a particular item of cost in the standards is not 
intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable; rather, 
determination as to allowability in each case should be based on the 
treatment or standards provided for similar or related items of cost. In 
case of discrepancy between the provisions of a specific research 
agreement and the applicable standards provided, the provisions of the 
research agreement should govern. However, in some cases advance 
understandings should be reached on particular cost items in order that 
the full costs of research be supported. The extent of allowability of 
the selected items of cost covered in this section has been stated to 
apply broadly to many accounting systems in varying environmental 
situations. Thus, as to any given research agreement, the reasonableness 
and allocability of certain items of costs may be difficult to 
determine, particularly in connection with hospitals which have medical 
school or other affiliations. In order to avoid possible subsequent 
disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness or nonallocability, it 
is important that prospective recipients of federal funds particularly 
those whose work is predominantly or substantially with the Government, 
seek agreement with the Government in advance of the incurrence of 
special or unusual costs in categories where reasonableness or 
allocability are difficult to determine. Such agreement may also be 
initiated by the Government. Any such agreement should be incorporated 
in the research agreement itself. However, the absence of such an 
advance agreement on any element of cost will not in itself serve to 
make that element either allowable or unallowable. Examples of costs on 
which advance agreements may be particularly important are:
    1. Facilities costs, such as;
    a. Depreciation
    b. Rental
    c. Use charges for fully depreciated assets
    d. Idle facilities and idle capacity
    e. Plant reconversion
    f. Extraordinary or deferred maintenance and repair
    g. Acquisition of automatic data processing equipment.
    2. Preaward costs
    3. Non-hospital professional activities
    4. Self-insurance
    5. Support services charged directly (computer services, printing 
and duplicating services, etc.)
    6. Employee compensation, travel, and other personnel costs, 
including;
    a. Compensation for personal service, including wages and salaries, 
bonuses and incentives, premium payments, pay for time not worked, and 
supplementary compensation and benefits, such as pension and retirement, 
group insurance, severance pay plans, and other forms of compensation
    b. Morale, health, welfare, and food service and dormitory costs
    c. Training and education costs
    d. Relocation costs, including special or mass personnel movement
    B. Selected items--1. Advertising costs. The term advertising costs 
means the costs of advertising media and corollary administrative costs. 
Advertising media include magazines, newspapers, radio and television 
programs, direct mail, exhibits, and the like. The only advertising 
costs allowable are those which are solely for;
    a. The recruitment of persons required for the performance by the 
institution of obligations arising under the research agreement, when 
considered in conjunction with all other recruitment costs as set forth 
in paragraph IX-B.34.
    b. The procurement of scarce items for the performance of the 
research agreement; or
    c. The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the 
performance of the research agreement.

Costs of this nature, if incurred for more than one research agreement 
or for both research agreement work and other work of the institution, 
are allowable to the extent that the principles in paragraphs IV and V 
are observed.
    2. Bad debts. Losses arising from uncollectible accounts and other 
claims and related collection and legal costs are unallowable except 
that a bad debt may be included as a direct cost of the research 
agreement to the extent that it is caused by a research patient and 
approved by the awarding agency. This inclusion is only intended to 
cover the situation of the patient admitted for research purposes who 
subsequently or in conjunction with the research receives clinical care 
for which a charge is made to the patient. If, after exhausting all 
means of collecting these charges, a bad debt results, it may be 
considered an appropriate charge to the research agreement.
    3. Bonding costs. a. Bonding costs arise when the Government 
requires assurance against financial loss to itself or others by reason 
of the act or default of the hospital. They arise also in instances 
where the hospital requires similar assurance.

[[Page 241]]

    Included are such types as bid, performance, payment, advance 
payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds.
    b. Costs of bonding required pursuant to the terms of the research 
agreement are allowable.
    c. Costs of bonding required by the hospital in the general conduct 
of its business are allowable to the extent that such bonding is in 
accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are 
reasonable under the circumstances.
    4. Capital expenditures. The costs of equipment, buildings, and 
repairs which materially increase the value or useful life of buildings 
or equipment should be capitalized and are unallowable except as 
provided for in the research agreement.
    5. Civil defense costs. Civil defense costs are those incurred in 
planning for, and the protection of life and property against the 
possible effects of enemy attack. Reasonable costs of civil defense 
measures (including costs in excess of normal plant protection costs, 
first-aid training and supplies, fire-fighting training, posting of 
additional exit notices and directions, and other approved civil defense 
measures) undertaken on the institution's premises pursuant to 
suggestions or requirements of civil defense authorities are allowable 
when distributed to all activities of the institution. Capital 
expenditures for civil defense purposes will not be allowed, but a use 
allowance or depreciation may be permitted in accordance with provisions 
set forth elsewhere. Costs of local civil defense projects not on the 
institution's premises are unallowable.
    6. Communication costs. Costs incurred for telephone services, local 
and long distance telephone calls, telegrams, radiograms, postage, and 
the like are allowable.
    7. Compensation for personal services-- a. General. Compensation for 
personal services covers all remuneration paid currently or accrued to 
employees of the hospital for services rendered during the period of 
performance under government research agreements. Such remuneration 
includes salaries, wages, staff benefits (see paragraph IX-B.10), and 
pension plan costs (see paragraph IX-B.25). The costs of such 
remuneration are allowable to the extent that the total compensation to 
individual employees is reasonable for the services rendered and 
conforms to the established policy of the institution consistently 
applied, and provided that the charges for work performed directly on 
government research agreements and for other work allocable as indirect 
costs to sponsored research are determined and supported as hereinafter 
provided. For non-profit, non-proprietary institutions, where federally 
supported programs constitute less than a preponderance of the activity 
at the institution the primary test of reasonableness will be to require 
that the institution's compensation policies be applied consistently 
both to federally-sponsored and non-sponsored activities alike. However, 
where special circumstances so dictate a contractual clause may be 
utilized which calls for application of the test of comparability in 
determining the reasonableness of compensation.
    b. Payroll distribution. Amounts charged to organized research for 
personal services, regardless of whether treated as direct costs or 
allocated as indirect costs, will be based on hospital payrolls which 
have been approved and documented in accordance with generally accepted 
hospital practices. In order to develop necessary direct and indirect 
allocations of cost, supplementary data on time or effort as provided in 
paragraph (c) below, normally need be required only for individuals 
whose compensation is properly chargeable to two or more research 
agreements or to two or more of the following broad functional 
categories: (1) Patient care; (2) organized research; (3) instruction 
and training; (4) indirect activities as defined in paragraph V-A; or 
(5) other hospital activities as defined in paragraph II-E.
    c. Reporting time or effort. Charges for salaries and wages of 
individuals other than members of the professional staff will be 
supported by daily time and attendance and payroll distribution records. 
For members of the professional staff, current and reasonable estimates 
of the percentage distribution of their total effort may be used as 
support in the absence of actual time records. The term professional 
staff for purposes of this section includes physicians, research 
associates, and other personnel performing work at responsible levels of 
activities. These personnel normally fulfill duties, the competent 
performance of which usually requires persons possessing degrees from 
accredited institutions of higher learning and/or state licensure. In 
order to qualify as current and reasonable, estimates must be made no 
later than one month (though not necessarily a calendar month) after the 
month in which the services were performed.
    d. Preparation of estimates of effort. Where required under 
paragraph (c) above, estimates of effort spent by a member of the 
professional staff on each research agreement should be prepared by the 
individual who performed the services or by a responsible individual 
such as a department head or supervisor having first-hand knowledge of 
the services performed on each research agreement. Estimates must show 
the allocation of effort between organized research and all other 
hospital activities in terms of the percentage of total effort devoted 
to each of the broad functional categories referred to in (b) above. The 
estimate of effort spent on a research agreement may include a 
reasonable amount of time spent in activities contributing and 
intimately related to work under

[[Page 242]]

the agreement, such as preparing and delivering special lectures about 
specific aspects of the ongoing research, writing research reports and 
articles, participating in appropriate research seminars, consulting 
with colleagues with respect to related research, and attending 
appropriate scientific meetings and conferences. The term ``all other 
hospital activities'' would include departmental research, 
administration, committee work, and public services undertaken on behalf 
of the hospital.
    e. Application of budget estimates. Estimates determined before the 
performance of services, such as budget estimates on a monthly, 
quarterly, or yearly basis do not qualify as estimates of effort spent.
    f. Non-hospital professional activities. A hospital must not alter 
or waive hospital-wide policies and practices dealing with the 
permissible extent of professional services over and above those 
traditionally performed without extra hospital compensation, unless such 
arrangements are specifically authorized by the sponsoring agency. Where 
hospital-wide policies do not adequately define the permissible extent 
of consultantships or other non-hospital activities undertaken for extra 
pay, the Government may require that the effort of professional staff 
working under research agreements be allocated as between (1) hospital 
activities, and (2) non-hospital professional activities. If the 
sponsoring agency should consider the extent of non-hospital 
professional effort excessive, appropriate arrangements governing 
compensation will be negotiated on a case by case basis.
    g. Salary rates for part-time appointments. Charges for work 
performed on government research by staff members having only part-time 
appointments will be determined at a rate not in excess of that for 
which he is regularly paid for his part-time staff assignment.
    8. Contingency provisions. Contributions to a contingency reserve or 
any similar provisions made for events the occurrence of which cannot be 
foretold with certainty as to time, intensity, or with an assurance of 
their happening, are unallowable.
    9. Depreciation and use allowances. a. Hospitals may be compensated 
for the use of buildings, capital improvements and usable equipment on 
hand through depreciation or use allowances. Depreciation is a charge to 
current operations which distributes the cost of a tangible capital 
asset, less estimated residual value, over the estimated useful life of 
the asset in a systematic and logical manner. It does not involve a 
process of valuation. Useful life has reference to the prospective 
period of economic usefulness in the particular hospital's operations as 
distinguished from physical life. Use allowances are the means of 
allowing compensation when depreciation or other equivalent costs are 
not considered.
    b. Due consideration will be given to government-furnished research 
facilities utilized by the institution when computing use allowances 
and/or depreciation if the government-furnished research facilities are 
material in amount. Computation of the use allowance and/or depreciation 
will exclude both the cost or any portion of the cost of grounds, 
buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, 
irrespective of where title was originally vested or where it presently 
resides, and secondly, the cost of grounds. Capital expenditures for 
land improvements (paved areas, fences, streets, sidewalks, utility 
conduits, and similar improvements not already included in the cost of 
buildings) are allowable provided the systematic amortization of such 
capital expenditures has been provided in the institution's books of 
accounts, based on reasonable determinations of the probable useful 
lives of the individual items involved, and the share allocated to 
organized research is developed from the amount thus amortized for the 
base period involved.
    c. Normal depreciation on a hospital's plant, equipment, and other 
capital facilities, except as excluded by (d) below, is an allowable 
element of research cost provided that the amount thereof is computed:
    1. Upon the property cost basis used by the hospital for Federal 
Income Tax purposes (See section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954); or
    2. In the case of non-profit or tax exempt organizations, upon a 
property cost basis which could have been used by the hospital for 
Federal Income Tax purposes, had such hospital been subject to the 
payment of income tax; and in either case
    3. By the consistent application to the assets concerned of any 
generally accepted accounting method, and subject to the limitations of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended, including--
    i. The straight line method;
    ii. The declining balance method, using a rate not exceeding twice 
the rate which would have been used had the annual allowance been 
computed under the method described in (i) above;
    iii. The sum of the years-digits method; and
    iv. Any other consistent method productive of an annual allowance 
which, when added to all allowances for the period commencing with the 
use of the property and including the current year, does not during the 
first two-thirds of the useful life of the property exceed the total of 
such allowances which would have been used had such allowances been 
computed under the method described in (ii) above.
    d. Where the depreciation method is followed, adequate property 
records must be

[[Page 243]]

maintained. The period of useful service (service life) established in 
each case for usable capital assets must be determined on a realistic 
basis which takes into consideration such factors as type of 
construction, nature of the equipment used, technological developments 
in the particular research area, and the renewal and replacement 
policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets 
involved. Where the depreciation method is introduced for application to 
assets acquired in prior years, the annual charges therefrom must not 
exceed the amounts that would have resulted had the depreciation method 
been in effect from the date of acquisition of such assets.
    e. Depreciation on idle or excess facilities shall not be allowed 
except on such facilities as are reasonably necessary for standby 
purposes.
    f. Where an institution elects to go on a depreciation basis for a 
particular class of assets, no depreciation, rental or use charge may be 
allowed on any such assets that would be viewed as fully depreciated; 
provided, however, that reasonable use charges may be negotiated for any 
such assets if warranted after taking into consideration the cost of the 
facility or item involved, the estimated useful life remaining at time 
of negotiation, the actual replacement policy followed in the light of 
service lives used for calculating depreciation, the effect of any 
increased maintenance charges or decreased efficiency due to age, and 
any other factors pertinent to the utilization of the facility or item 
for the purpose contemplated.
    g. Hospitals which choose a depreciation allowance for assets 
purchased prior to 1966 based on a percentage of operating costs in lieu 
of normal depreciation for purposes of reimbursement under Pub. L. 89-97 
(Medicare) shall utilize that method for determining depreciation 
applicable to organized research.
    The operating costs to be used are the lower of the hospital's 1965 
operating costs or the hospital's current year's allowable costs. The 
percent to be applied is 5 percent starting with the year 1966-67, with 
such percentage being uniformity reduced by one-half percent each 
succeeding year. The allowance based on operating costs is in addition 
to regular depreciation on assets acquired after 1965. However, the 
combined amount of such allowance on pre-1966 assets and the allowance 
for actual depreciation on assets acquired after 1965 may not exceed 6 
percent of the hospital's allowable cost for the current year. After 
total depreciation has been computed, allocation methods are used to 
determine the share attributable to organized research.
    For purposes of this section, Operating Costs means the total costs 
incurred by the hospital in operating the institution, and includes 
patient care, research, and other activities. Allowable Costs means 
operating costs less unallowable costs as defined in these principles; 
by the application of allocation methods to the total amount of such 
allowable costs, the share attributable to Federally-sponsored research 
is determined.
    A hospital which elects to use this procedure under Pub. L. 89-97 
and subsequently changes to an actual depreciation basis on pre-1966 
assets in accordance with the option afforded under the Medicare program 
shall simultaneously change to an actual depreciation basis for 
organized research.
    Where the hospital desires to change to actual depreciation but 
either has no historical cost records or has incomplete records, the 
determination of historical cost could be made through appropriate means 
involving expert consultation with the determination being subject to 
review and approval by the Department of Health and Human Services.
    h. Where the use allowance method is followed, the use allowance for 
buildings and improvements will be computed at an annual rate not 
exceeding two percent of acquisition cost. The use allowance for 
equipment will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding six and two-
thirds percent of acquisition cost of usable equipment in those cases 
where the institution maintains current records with respect to such 
equipment on hand. Where the institution's records reflect only the cost 
(actual or estimated) of the original complement of equipment, the use 
allowance will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding ten percent 
of such cost. Original complement for this purpose means the complement 
of equipment initially placed in buildings to perform the functions 
currently being performed in such buildings; however, where a permanent 
change in the function of a building takes place, a redetermination of 
the original complement of equipment may be made at that time to 
establish a new original complement. In those cases where no equipment 
records are maintained, the institution will justify a reasonable 
estimate of the acquisition cost of usable equipment which may be used 
to compute the use allowance at an annual rate not exceeding six and 
two-thirds percent of such estimate.
    i. Depreciation and/or use charges should usually be allocated to 
research and other activities as an indirect cost.
    10. Employee morale, health, and welfare costs and credits. The 
costs of house publications, health or first-aid benefits, recreational 
activities, employees' counseling services, and other expenses incurred 
in accordance with the hospital's established practice or custom for the 
improvement of working conditions, employer-employee relations, employee 
morale, and employee performance, are allowable. Such costs will be 
equitably apportioned to all activities of the hospital. Income 
generated from any of these activities will be credited to the cost 
thereof unless

[[Page 244]]

such income has been irrevocably set over to employee welfare 
organizations.
    11. Entertainment costs. Except as pertains to 10 above, costs 
incurred for amusement, social activities, entertainment, and any items 
relating thereto, such as meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and 
gratuities are unallowable.
    12. Equipment and other facilities. The cost of equipment or other 
facilities are allowable on a direct charge basis where such purchases 
are approved by the sponsoring agency concerned or provided for by the 
terms of the research agreement.
    13. Fines and penalties. Costs resulting from violations of, or 
failure of the institution to comply with federal, state and local laws 
and regulations are unallowable except when incurred as a result of 
compliance with specific provisions of the research agreement, or 
instructions in writing from the awarding agency.
    14. Insurance and indemnification. a. Costs of insurance required or 
approved and maintained pursuant to the research agreement are 
allowable.
    b. Costs of other insurance maintained by the hospital in connection 
with the general conduct of its activities are allowable subject to the 
following limitations: (1) Types and extent and cost of coverage must be 
in accordance with sound institutional practice; (2) costs of insurance 
or of any contributions to any reserve covering the risk of loss of or 
damage to government owned property are unallowable except to the extent 
that the Government has specifically required or approved such costs; 
and (3) costs of insurance on the lives of officers or trustees are 
unallowable except where such insurance is part of an employee plan 
which is not unduly restricted.
    c. Contributions to a reserve for an approved self-insurance program 
are allowable to the extent that the types of coverage, extent of 
coverage, and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had 
insurance been purchased to cover the risks. Such contributions are 
subject to prior approval of the Government.
    d. Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible 
insurance (through an approved self-insurance program or otherwise) are 
unallowable unless expressly provided for in the research agreement, 
except that costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal 
deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management 
practice as well as minor losses not covered by insurance such as 
spoilage, breakage and disappearance of small hand tools which occur in 
the ordinary course of operations are allowable.
    15. Interest, fund raising and investment management costs. a. Costs 
incurred for interest on borrowed capital or temporary use of endowment 
funds, however represented, are unallowable.
    b. Costs of organized fund raising, including financial campaigns, 
endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests, and similar 
expenses incurred solely to raise capital or obtain contributions are 
not allowable.
    c. Costs of investment counsel and staff and similar expenses 
incurred solely to enhance income from investments are not allowable.
    d. Costs related to the physical custody and control of monies and 
securities are allowable.
    16. Labor relations costs. Costs incurred in maintaining 
satisfactory relations between the hospital and its employees, including 
costs of labor management committees, employees' publications, and other 
related activities are allowable.
    17. Losses on research agreements or contracts. Any excess of costs 
over income under any agreement or contract of any nature is 
unallowable. This includes, but is not limited to, the hospital's 
contributed portion by reason of cost-sharing agreements, under-
recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for overhead, or legal or 
administrative limitations.
    18. Maintenance and repair costs. a. Costs necessary for the upkeep 
of property (including government property unless otherwise provided 
for), which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor 
appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient 
operating condition, are to be treated as follows:
    1. Normal maintenance and repair costs are allowable;
    2. Extraordinary maintenance and repair costs are allowable, 
provided they are allocated to the periods to which applicable for 
purposes of determining research costs.
    b. Expenditures for plant and equipment, including rehabilitation 
thereof, which according to generally accepted accounting principles as 
applied under the hospital's established policy, should be capitalized 
and subjected to depreciation, are allowable only on a depreciation 
basis.
    19. Material costs. Costs incurred for purchased materials, supplies 
and fabricated parts directly or indirectly related to the research 
agreement, are allowable. Purchases made specifically for the research 
agreement should be charged thereto at their actual prices after 
deducting all cash discounts, trade discounts, rebates, and allowances 
received by the institution. Withdrawals from general stores or 
stockrooms should be charged at their cost under any recognized method 
of pricing stores withdrawals conforming to sound accounting practices 
consistently followed by the hospital. Incoming transportation charges 
are a proper part of material cost. Direct material cost should

[[Page 245]]

include only the materials and supplies actually used for the 
performance of the research agreement, and due credit should be given 
for any excess materials retained or returned to vendors. Due credit 
should be given for all proceeds or value received for any scrap 
resulting from work under the research agreement. Where government 
donated or furnished material is used in performing the research 
agreement, such material will be used without charge.
    20. Memberships, subscriptions and professional activity costs. a. 
Costs of the hospital's membership in civic, business, technical and 
professional organizations are allowable.
    b. Costs of the hospital's subscriptions to civic, business, 
professional and technical periodicals are allowable.
    c. Costs of meetings and conferences, when the primary purpose is 
the dissemination of technical information, are allowable. This includes 
costs of meals, transportation, rental of facilities, and other items 
incidental to such meetings or conferences.
    21. Organization costs. Expenditures such as incorporation fees, 
attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, brokers' fees, fees to promoters and 
organizers in connection with (a) organization or reorganization of a 
hospital, or (b) raising capital, are unallowable.
    22. Other business expenses. Included in this item are such 
recurring expenses as registry and transfer charges resulting from 
changes in ownership of securities issued by the hospital, cost of 
shareholders meetings preparation and publication of reports to 
shareholders, preparation and submission of required reports and forms 
to taxing and other regulatory bodies, and incidental costs of directors 
and committee meetings. The above and similar costs are allowable when 
allocated on an equitable basis.
    23. Patient care. The cost of routine and ancillary or special 
services to research patients is an allowable direct cost of research 
agreements.
    a. Routine services shall include the costs of the regular room, 
dietary and nursing services, minor medical and surgical supplies and 
the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not 
customarily made.
    b. Ancillary or special services are the services for which charges 
are customarily made in addition to routine services, such as operating 
rooms, anesthesia, laboratory, BMR-EKG, etc.
    c. Patient care, whether expressed as a rate or an amount, shall be 
computed in a manner consistent with the procedures used to determine 
reimbursable costs under Pub. L. 89-97 (Medicare Program) as defined 
under the ``Principles Of Reimbursement For Provider Costs'' published 
by the Social Security Administration of the Department of Health and 
Human Services. The allowability of specific categories of cost shall be 
in accordance with those principles rather than the principles for 
research contained herein. In the absence of participation in the 
Medicare program by a hospital, all references to the Medicare program 
in these principles shall be construed as meaning the Medicaid program.
    i. Once costs have been recognized as allowable, the indirect costs 
or general service center's cost shall be allocated (stepped- down) to 
special service centers, and all patient and nonpatient costs centers 
based upon actual services received or benefiting these centers.
    ii. After allocation, routine and ancillary costs shall be 
apportioned to scatter-bed research patients on the same basis as is 
used to apportion costs to Medicare patients, i.e. using either the 
departmental method or the combination method, as those methods are 
defined by the Social Security Administration; except that final 
settlement shall be on a grant-by-grant basis. However, to the extent 
that the Social Security Administration has recognized any other method 
of cost apportionment, that method generally shall also be recognized as 
applicable to the determination of research patient care costs.
    iii. A cost center must be established on Medicare reimbursement 
forms for each discrete-bed unit grant award received by a hospital. 
Routine costs should be stepped-down to this line item(s) in the normal 
course of stepping-down costs under Medicare/Medicaid requirements. 
However, in stepping-down routine costs, consideration must be given to 
preventing a step-down of those costs to discrete-bed unit line items 
that have already been paid for directly by the grant, such as bedside 
nursing costs. Ancillary costs allocable to research discrete-bed units 
shall be determined and proposed in accordance with Section 23.c.ii.
    d. Where federally sponsored research programs provide specifically 
for the direct reimbursement of nursing, dietary, and other services, 
appropriate adjustment must be made to patient care costs to preclude 
duplication and/or misallocation of costs.
    24. Patent costs. Costs of preparing disclosures, reports and other 
documents required by the research agreement and of searching the art to 
the extent necessary to make such invention disclosures are allowable. 
In accordance with the clauses of the research agreement relating to 
patents, costs of preparing documents and any other patent costs, in 
connection with the filing of a patent application where title is 
conveyed to the Government, are allowable. (See also paragraph IX-B.36.)
    25. Pension plan costs. Costs of the hospital's pension plan which 
are incurred in accordance with the established policies of the 
institution are allowable, provided such policies meet the test of 
reasonableness and the

[[Page 246]]

methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory, and provided 
appropriate adjustments are made for credits or gains arising out of 
normal and abnormal employee turnover or any other contingencies that 
can result in forfeitures by employees which inure to the benefit of the 
hospital.
    26. Plan security costs. Necessary expenses incurred to comply with 
government security requirements including wages, uniforms and equipment 
of personnel engaged in plant protection are allowable.
    27. Preresearch agreement costs. Costs incurred prior to the 
effective date of the research agreement, whether or not they would have 
been allowable thereunder if incurred after such date, are unallowable 
unless specifically set forth and identified in the research agreement.
    28. Professional services costs. a. Costs of professional services 
rendered by the members of a particular profession who are not employees 
of the hospital are allowable subject to (b) and (c) below when 
reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent 
upon recovery of the costs from the Government. Retainer fees to be 
allowable must be reasonably supported by evidence of services rendered.
    b. Factors to be considered in determining the allowability of costs 
in a particular case include (1) the past pattern of such costs, 
particularly in the years prior to the award of government research 
agreements on the institution's total activity; (2) the nature and scope 
of managerial services expected of the institution's own organizations; 
and (3) whether the proportion of government work to the hospital's 
total activity is such as to influence the institution in favor of 
incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered are not of 
a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under 
government research agreements.
    c. Costs of legal, accounting and consulting services, and related 
costs incurred in connection with organization and reorganization or the 
prosecution of claims against the Government are unallowable. Costs of 
legal, accounting and consulting services, and related costs incurred in 
connection with patent infringement litigation are unallowable unless 
otherwise provided for in the research agreement.
    29. Profits and losses on disposition of plant equipment, or other 
assets. Profits or losses of any nature arising from the sale or 
exchange of plant, equipment, or other capital assets, including sales 
or exchange of either short- or long-term investments, shall be excluded 
in computing research agreement costs.
    30. Proposal costs. Proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids 
or proposals on potential government and non-government research 
agreements or projects, including the development of technical data and 
cost data necessary to support the institution's bids or proposals. 
Proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful and 
unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as indirect 
costs and allocated currently to all activities of the institution, and 
no proposal costs of past accounting periods will be allocable in the 
current period to the government research agreement. However, the 
institution's established practices may be to treat proposal costs by 
some other recognized method. Regardless of the methods used, the 
results obtained may be accepted only if found to be reasonable and 
equitable.
    31. Public information services costs. Costs of news releases 
pertaining to specific research or scientific accomplishment are 
unallowable unless specifically authorized by the sponsoring agency.
    32. Rearrangement and alteration costs. Costs incurred for ordinary 
or normal rearrangement and alteration of facilities are allowable. 
Special rearrangement and alteration costs incurred specifically for a 
project are allowable only as a direct charge when such work has been 
approved in advance by the sponsoring agency concerned.
    33. Reconversion costs. Costs incurred in the restoration or 
rehabilitation of the institution's facilities to approximately the same 
condition existing immediately prior to commencement of government 
research agreement work, fair wear and tear excepted, are allowable.
    34. Recruiting costs. a. Subject to (b), (c), and (d) below, and 
provided that the size of the staff recruited and maintained is in 
keeping with workload requirements, costs of ``help wanted'' 
advertising, operating costs of an employment office necessary to secure 
and maintain an adequate staff, costs of operating an aptitude and 
educational testing program, travel costs of employees while engaged in 
recruiting personnel, travel costs of applicants for interviews for 
prospective employment, and relocation costs incurred incident to 
recruitment of new employees are allowable to the extent that such costs 
are incurred pursuant to a well managed recruitment program. Where an 
institution uses employment agencies, costs not in excess of standard 
commercial rates for such services are allowable.
    b. In publications, costs of help wanted advertising that includes 
color, includes advertising material for other than recruitment 
purposes, or is excessive in size (taking into consideration recruitment 
purposes for which intended and normal institutional practices in this 
respect) are unallowable.
    c. Costs of help wanted advertising, special emoluments; fringe 
benefits, and salary allowances incurred to attract professional 
personnel from other institutions that do not meet the test of 
reasonableness or do not conform with the established practices of the 
institution are unallowable.

[[Page 247]]

    d. Where relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of a new 
employee have been allowed either as an allocable direct or indirect 
cost, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within his 
control within twelve months after hire, the institution will be 
required to refund or credit such relocations costs as were charged to 
the Government.
    35. Rental costs (including sale and lease-back of facilities). a. 
Rental costs of land, building, and equipment and other personal 
property are allowable if the rates are reasonable in light of such 
factors as rental costs of comparable facilities and market conditions 
in the area, the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the 
facilities leased, options available, and other provisions of the rental 
agreement. Application of these factors, in situations where rentals are 
extensively used, may involve among other considerations comparison of 
rental costs with the amount which the hospital would have received had 
it owned the facilities.
    b. Charges in the nature of rent between organizations having a 
legal or other affiliation or arrangement such as hospitals, medical 
schools, foundations, etc., are allowable to the extent such charges do 
not exceed the normal costs of ownership such as depreciation, taxes, 
insurance, and maintenance, provided that no part of such costs shall 
duplicate any other allowed costs.
    c. Unless otherwise specifically provided in the agreement, rental 
costs specified in sale and lease-back agreements incurred by hospitals 
through selling plant facilities to investment organizations such as 
insurance companies or to private investors, and concurrently leasing 
back the same facilities are allowable only to the extent that such 
rentals do not exceed the amount which the hospital would have received 
had it retained legal title to the facilities.
    36. Royalties and other costs for use of patents. Royalties on a 
patent or amortization of the cost of acquiring a patent or invention or 
rights thereto necessary for the proper performance of the research 
agreement and applicable to tasks or processes thereunder are allowable 
unless the Government has a license or the right to free use of the 
patent, the patent has been adjudicated to be invalid, or has been 
administratively determined to be invalid, the patent is considered to 
be unenforceable, or the patent has expired.
    37. Severance pay. a. Severance pay is compensation in addition to 
regular salaries and wages which is paid by a hospital to employees 
whose services are being terminated. Costs of severance pay are 
allowable only to the extent that such payments are required by law, by 
employer-employee agreement, by established policy that constitutes in 
effect an implied agreement on the institution's part, or by 
circumstances of the particular employment.
    b. Severance payments that are due to normal, recurring turnover, 
and which otherwise meet the conditions of (a) above may be allowed 
provided the actual costs of such severance payments are regarded as 
expenses applicable to the current fiscal year and are equitably 
distributed among the institution's activities during that period.
    c. Severance payments that are due to abnormal or mass terminations 
are of such conjectural nature that allowability must be determined on a 
case-by-case basis. However, the Government recognizes its obligation to 
participate to the extent of its fair share in any specific payment.
    38. Specialized service facilities operated by a hospital. a. The 
costs of institutional services involving the use of highly complex and 
specialized facilities such as electronic computers and reactors are 
allowable provided the charges therefor meet the conditions of (b) or 
(c) below, and otherwise take into account any items of income or 
federal financing that qualify as applicable credits under paragraph 
III-E.
    b. The costs of such hospital services normally will be charged 
directly to applicable research agreements based on actual usage or 
occupancy of the facilities at rates that (1) are designed to recover 
only actual costs of providing such services, and (2) are applied on a 
nondiscriminatory basis as between organized research and other work of 
the hospital including commercial or accommodation sales and usage by 
the hospital for internal purposes. This would include use of such 
facilities as radiology, laboratories, maintenance men used for a 
special purpose, medical art, photography, etc.
    c. In the absence of an acceptable arrangement for direct costing as 
provided in (b) above, the costs incurred for such institutional 
services may be assigned to research agreements as indirect costs, 
provided the methods used achieve substantially the same results. Such 
arrangements should be worked out in coordination with all government 
users of the facilities in order to assure equitable distribution of the 
indirect costs.
    39. Special administrative costs. Costs incurred for general public 
relations activities, catalogs, alumni activities, and similar services 
are unallowable.
    40. Staff and/or employee benefits. a. Staff and/or employee 
benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during 
periods of authorized absences from the job such as for annual leave, 
sick leave, military leave and the like are allowable provided such 
costs are absorbed by all hospital activities including organized 
research in proportion to the relative amount of time or effort actually 
devoted to each.
    b. Staff benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses 
for Social Security

[[Page 248]]

taxes, employee insurance, Workmen's Compensation insurance, the Pension 
Plan (see paragraph IX-B.25), hospital costs or remission of hospital 
charges to the extent of costs for individual employees or their 
families, and the like are allowable provided such benefits are granted 
in accordance with established hospital policies, and provided such 
contributions and other expenses whether treated as indirect costs or an 
increment of direct labor costs are distributed to particular research 
agreements and other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern 
of benefits accruing to the individuals or groups of employees whose 
salaries and wages are chargeable to such research agreements and other 
activities.
    41. Taxes. a. In general, taxes which the hospital is required to 
pay and which are paid or accrued in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and payments made to local governments in lieu of 
taxes which are commensurate with the local government services received 
are allowable except for (1) taxes from which exemptions are available 
to the hospital directly or which are available to the hospital based on 
an exemption afforded the Government and in the latter case when the 
sponsoring agency makes available the necessary exemption certificates, 
(2) special assessments on land which represent capital improvements, 
and (3) Federal Income Taxes.
    b. Any refund of taxes, interest, or penalties, and any payment to 
the hospital of interest thereon attributable to taxes, interest or 
penalties, which were allowed as research agreement costs will be 
credited or paid to the Government in the manner directed by the 
Government provided any interest actually paid or credited to a hospital 
incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty will be paid or 
credited to the Government only to the extent that such interest accrued 
over the period during which the hospital had been reimbursed by the 
Government for the taxes, interest, and penalties.
    42. Transportation costs. Costs incurred for inbound freight, 
express, cartage, postage and other transportation services relating 
either to goods purchased, in process, or delivered are allowable. When 
such costs can readily be identified with the items involved, they may 
be charged directly as transportation costs or added to the cost of such 
items. Where identification with the material received cannot readily be 
made, inbound transportation costs may be charged to the appropriate 
indirect cost accounts if the institution follows a consistent equitable 
procedure in this respect. Outbound freight, if reimbursable under the 
terms of the research agreement, should be treated as a direct cost.
    43. Travel costs. a. Travel costs are the expenses for 
transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by 
employees who are in travel status on official business of the hospital. 
Such costs may be charged on an actual basis, on a per diem or mileage 
basis in lieu of actual costs incurred, or on a combination of the two 
provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to 
selected days of the trip, and results in charges consistent with those 
normally allowed by the institution in its regular operations.
    b. Travel costs are allowable subject to (c) and (d) below when they 
are directly attributable to specific work under a research agreement or 
when they are incurred in the normal course of administration of the 
hospital or a department or research program thereof.
    c. The difference in cost between first class air accommodations and 
less than first class air accommodations is unallowable except when less 
than first class air accommodations are not reasonably available to meet 
necessary mission requirements such as where less than first class 
accommodations would (1) require circuitous routing, (2) require travel 
during unreasonable hours, (3) greatly increase the duration of the 
flight, (4) result in additional costs which would offset the 
transportation savings, or (5) offer accommodations which are not 
reasonably adequate for the medical needs of the traveler.
    d. Costs of personnel movements of a special or mass nature are 
allowable only when authorized or approved in writing by the sponsoring 
agency or its authorized representative.
    44. Termination costs applicable to contracts. a. Contract 
terminations generally give rise to the incurrence of costs or to the 
need for special treatment of costs which would not have arisen had the 
contract not been terminated. Items peculiar to termination are set 
forth below. They are to be used in conjunction with all other 
provisions of these principles in the case of contract termination.
    b. The cost of common items of material reasonably usable on the 
hospital's other work will not be allowable unless the hospital submits 
evidence that it could not retain such items at cost without sustaining 
a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other 
work of the institution, consideration should be given to the hospital's 
plans for current scheduled work or activities including other research 
agreements. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the hospital 
will be regarded as evidence that such items are reasonably usable on 
the hospital's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allowable 
to the terminated portion of the contract should be limited to the 
extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on 
order are in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirement of other 
work.

[[Page 249]]

    c. If in a particular case, despite all reasonable efforts by the 
hospital, certain costs cannot be discontinued immediately after the 
effective date of termination, such costs are generally allowable within 
the limitations set forth in these principles, except that any such 
costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful 
failure of the hospital to discontinue such costs will be considered 
unacceptable.
    d. Loss of useful value of special tooling and special machinery and 
equipment is generally allowable, provided (1) such special tooling, 
machinery or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other 
work of the hospital; (2) the interest of the Government is protected by 
transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the 
contracting officer; and (3) the loss of useful value as to any one 
terminated contract is limited to that portion of the acquisition cost 
which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the 
terminated portion of the contract bears to the entire terminated 
contract and other government contracts for which the special tooling, 
special machinery or equipment was acquired.
    e. Rental costs under unexpired leases are generally allowable where 
clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of 
the terminated contract, less the residual value of such leases, if (1) 
the amount of such rental claimed does not exceed the reasonable use 
value of the property leased for the period of the contract and such 
further period as may be reasonable; and (2) the hospital makes all 
reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the 
cost of such lease. There also may be included the cost of alterations 
of such leased property, provided such alterations were necessary for 
the performance of the contract and of reasonable restoration required 
by the provisions of the lease.
    f. Settlement expenses including the following are generally 
allowable: (1) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably 
necessary for the preparation and presentation to contracting officers 
of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated 
portion of the contract and the termination and settlement of 
subcontracts; and (2) reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, 
protection, and disposition of property provided by the Government or 
acquired or produced by the institution for the contract.
    g. Subcontractor claims including the allocable portion of claims 
which are common to the contract and to other work of the contractor are 
generally allowable.
    45. Voluntary services. The value of voluntary services provided by 
sisters or other members of religious orders is allowable provided that 
amounts do not exceed that paid other employees for similar work. Such 
amounts must be identifiable in the records of the hospital as a legal 
obligation of the hospital. This may be reflected by an agreement 
between the religious order and the hospital supported by evidence of 
payments to the order.

<R05>
Sec. 76.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:
    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in Sec. 76.105), and participants who have voluntarily 
excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

<R05>
Sec. 76.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant

[[Page 253]]

and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the 
Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) 
and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered 
transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of Federally-required audit services.
    (3) Researchers.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to National or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 76.200, ``Debarment or 
suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. 
Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and 
principals in the covered transactions and activities described in Sec. 
76.110(a). Sections 76.325, ``Scope of debarment,'' and 76.420, ``Scope 
of suspension,'' govern the extent to which a specific participant or 
organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included 
within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which 
affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought 
within the scope of the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.
    (d) Relationship to Medicare and State Health Care Program 
Exclusions. Any exclusion from Medicare and State health care program 
participation by HHS under Title XI of the Social Security Act, 42 
U.S.C. 1320a-7, (see also 42 CFR 1001.1901) on or after August 25, 1995 
shall be recognized by and effective, not only for all HHS programs, but 
also for all other Executive Branch procurement and nonprocurement 
activities.

<R05>
Sec. 76.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not

[[Page 254]]

for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or suspension 
for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in these 
regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

covered transactions (see Sec. 76.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of their

awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international

governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;

excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>

Sec. 76.215  Exception provision.

    HHS may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and Sec. 
76.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated intention in 
the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only infrequently.

Sec. 76.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under

[[Page 255]]

48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary 
exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and participants may 
continue covered transactions in existence at the time the person was 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A decision as to the 
type of termination action, if any, to be taken should be made only 
after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in Sec. 
76.215.

<R05>
Sec. 76.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 76.215 or Sec. 76.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction 
with a person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See Appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

                          Subpart C--Debarment


<R05>
Sec. 76.300  General.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 76.305, using procedures established in Sec.Sec. 76.310 through 
76.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not 
necessarily require that the person be debarred; the seriousness of the 
person's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors shall be 
considered in making any debarment decision.


<R05>
Sec. 76.305  Causes for debarment.

    Debarment may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec.Sec. 76.300 through 76.314 for:

integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the 
present responsibility of a person.
    (b) Violation of the terms of a public agreement or transaction so 
serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as:
    (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one 
or more public agreements or transactions;

of one or more public agreements or transactions; or
    (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or 
requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction.
    (c) Any of the following causes:

[[Page 256]]

    (1) A nonprocurement debarment by any Federal agency taken before 
October 1, 1988, the effective date of these regulations, or a 
procurement debarment by any Federal agency taken pursuant to 48 CFR 
Subpart 9.4;
    (2) Knowingly doing business with a debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
or voluntarily excluded person, in connection with a covered 
transaction, except as permitted in Sec. 76.215 or Sec. 76.220;
    (3) Failure to pay a single substantial debt, or a number of 
outstanding debts (including disallowed costs and overpayments, but not 
including sums owed the Federal Government under the Internal Revenue

debtor's legal and administrative remedies have been exhausted;
    (4) Violation of a material provision of a voluntary exclusion 
agreement entered into under Sec. 76.315 or of any settlement of a 
debarment or suspension action; or

<R05>
Sec. 76.310  Procedures.

    HHS shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, 
consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the 
procedures in Sec.Sec. 76.311 through 76.314.


<R05>
Sec. 76.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 76.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 76.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Sec. 76.311 through Sec. 76.314, and any 
other HHS procedures, if applicable, governing debarment decisionmaking; 
and
    (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 76.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts.
    (1) In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the 
debarring official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 76.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring

[[Page 257]]

official extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary.
    (1) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to 
determine disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be 
prepared. The debarring official shall base the decision on the facts as 
found, together with any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent and any other information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c) Standard of proof.
    (1) In any debarment action, the cause for debarment must be 
established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where the proposed 
debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the standard 
shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 76.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 76.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, HHS may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see Subpart E).


<R05>
Sec. 76.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of Subpart F of this part generally should not exceed 
three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment 
may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements 
of Subpart F of this part (see Sec. 76.305(c)(5)), the period of 
debarment shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Sec.Sec. 76.311 through 76.314 shall be followed to extend the 
debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;

[[Page 258]]

    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 76.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Sec.Sec. 76.311 through 
76.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed 
to other participants if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the 
joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar 
arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these 
participants. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall 
be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

                          Subpart D--Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 76.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the 
causes in Sec. 76.405 using procedures established in Sec.Sec. 76.410 
through 76.413.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 76.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 76.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec.Sec. 76.400 through 76.413 upon adequate evidence:
    (1) To suspect the commission of an offense listed in Sec. 
76.305(a); or
    (2) That a cause for debarment under Sec. 76.305 may exist.
    (b) Indictment shall constitute adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.


<R05>
Sec. 76.410  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence 
of a cause for suspension from any source

[[Page 259]]

shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the suspending official for consideration. After 
consideration, the suspending official may issue a notice of suspension.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. HHS shall process suspension actions as 
informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness, using the procedures in Sec. 76.411 through Sec. 76.413.


<R05>
Sec. 76.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 76.405 for imposing 
suspension;
    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings;
    (f) Of the provisions of Sec. 76.411 through Sec. 76.413 and any 
other HHS procedures, if applicable, governing suspension 
decisionmaking; and
    (g) Of the effect of the suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 76.412  Opportunity to contest suspension.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of suspension, the respondent may submit, in person, in writing, 
or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to 
the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts.
    (1) If the suspending official finds that the respondent's 
submission in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to 
the suspension, respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear 
with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, 
and confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the 
suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request, 
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 76.413  Suspending official's decision.

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 76.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or scope 
of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to modify or 
terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the subsequent 
imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by any agency. 
The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the following 
provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary.
    (1) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to 
determine disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be 
prepared. The suspending official shall base the decision on the facts 
as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent and any

[[Page 260]]

other information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 76.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program

debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken. Until February 18, 1989, the agency shall also 
provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in 
which HHS has granted exceptions under Sec. 76.215 permitting 
participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency

[[Page 261]]


<R05>
Sec. 76.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in Appendix A to this 
Part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(Tel. <greek-i>). Adverse information on the certification will not 
necessarily result in denial of participation. However, the 
certification, and any additional information pertaining to the 
certification submitted by the participant, shall be considered in the 
administration of covered transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in Appendix B to 
this Part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligiblity of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants 
(Tel. <greek-i>).
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to HHS if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated notice 
to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

    (2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to

under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee 
shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.
    (b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the

entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a 
one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this

award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall

[[Page 264]]

ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, 
unless the Federal agency designates a central location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 76.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal 
drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an 
employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute 
occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar 
days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, 
unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt 
of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.

     and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to

[[Page 265]]

the department or agency to which this proposal is submitted if at any 
time the prospective primary participant learns that its certification 
was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of 
changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in

it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction 
with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.
    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all 
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier 
covered transactions.

certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.

   Appendix C to Part 76--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file

[[Page 267]]

in its office and make the information available for Federal inspection. 
Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a violation of the 
grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal

PART 77--REMEDIAL ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO LETTER OF CREDIT ADMINISTRATION
--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
77.1 Purpose.
77.2 Scope.
77.3 Conditions that may give rise to remedial actions.
77.4 Remedial actions.
77.5 Remedial action procedures.
77.6 Emergency procedures.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301.

    Source: 50 FR 781, Jan. 7, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 77.1  Purpose.

    Letters of credit with the United States Treasury, issued by the 
Department to States or other grantees and contractors, are a convenient 
means for disbursing Federal funds to recipients of grant awards or 
contracts (recipient organizations) under the programs of this and other 
Executive Departments. The sound and efficient operation of the letter-
of-credit system is dependent in large part upon the honesty, good 
faith, and responsible financial management of recipient organizations 
that receive funds pursuant to letters of credit. This part sets forth 
conditions that may prompt the Department to seek remedial action 
against a recipient organization operating under a letter of credit and 
the procedures that will be used to reach a final decision regarding the 
taking of remedial actions against a recipient organization.


<R05>
Sec. 77.2  Scope.

    The regulations in this part apply to all recipient organizations 
under any program administered by the Department through which the 
organization receives Federal funds under a letter of credit.


<R05>
Sec. 77.3  Conditions that may give rise to remedial actions.

    If the Department determines that any of the following conditions is 
present in a recipient organization's administration of a letter of 
credit, it may take remedial actions against the organization:
    (a) A recipient organization draws Federal funds through its letter 
of credit in excess of the aggregate grant award or contract authority 
currently available to it.
    (b) A recipient organization draws Federal funds for a particular 
program in excess of currently available grant award or contract 
authority for that program, even though the organization may not have 
exceeded its aggregate grant award or contract authority.
    (c) A recipient organization fails to file timely all reports and 
other data required by the Department in connection with its grant 
awards, contracts, or letter of credit.
    (d) A recipient organization accumulates, through its letter of 
credit or otherwise, excess amounts of Federal funds relative to its 
actual and immediate disbursement requirements.
    (e) A recipient organization's cash management system fails to 
comply with generally accepted accounting principles or Departmental 
regulations or demonstrates irregularities, misrepresentations, fraud, 
or abuse in its operation.

[[Page 269]]


<R05>
Sec. 77.4  Remedial actions.

    If, after the conclusion of the procedures set forth in Sec. 77.5 or 
Sec. 77.6 the Department finds that one or more of the conditions set 
forth in Sec. 77.3 is or has been present, the Department may take the 
following remedial actions against a recipient organization's use of its 
letter of credit:
    (a) The Department may place special limits, restrictions, or 
controls upon the recipient organization's use of its letter of credit.
    (b) The Department may require more frequent or more detailed 
financial reporting from the recipient organization.
    (c) The Department may suspend, reduce, or terminate the recipient 
organization's use of its letter of credit.


<R05>
Sec. 77.5  Remedial action procedures.

    Except as provided in Sec. 77.6, the Department will use the 
following procedures whenever it seeks the remedial action specified in 
Sec. 77.4.
    (a) Notice. Prior to taking remedial action, the Department will 
provide the recipient organization written notice of its intended action 
setting forth both the legal and factual reasons therefor. Notice may be 
provided by certified or express mail, TWX, telegram, delivery, or 
similar means.
    (b) Opportunity to respond. (1) The recipient organization has 30 
days after receipt of the notice in which to submit to the Department a 
written statement setting forth any legal and factual reasons why it 
believes the proposed remedial action would be inappropriate. If no 
response is received by the Department within the 30-day period, the 
Department may make the proposed remedial action effective immediately. 
If a response opposing the taking of remedial action is received from 
the recipient organization within the 30-day period, no remedial action 
will be taken until a final decision has been reached under paragraph 
(c) of this section. (2) The Department may prepare a written reply to 
the recipient organization's response. Any such reply will be forwarded 
to the deciding official together with the notice sent to the recipient 
organization and the organization's response, and a copy of the reply 
will be served on the recipient organization.
    (c) Departmental decision. The Department's decision to take 
remedial action under this part will be made by an official of the 
Department who had no involvement with the initial determination to seek 
remedial action. The deciding official may affirm, reverse, or modify 
the initial determination. In making the decision, the official will 
consider only the notice provided by the Department, the recipient 
organization's statement, the Department's reply, together with any 
other documents attached to them, and statements at any informal 
conference held pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The 
official's decision will be provided to the recipient organization in 
writing and will constitute the Department's final administrative action 
on the matter.
    (d) Informal conference. If, in the judgment of the official 
designated to make a final decision, it would materially enhance his 
ability to resolve the matters in dispute, he may convene an informal 
conference to question or hear an oral presentation by the parties. If 
an informal conference is convened it will be transcribed.
    (e) Effect of decision. The decision in a proceeding under this 
section affects only the recipient organization's obligations related to 
its letter of credit and does not determine the organization's ultimate 
liability with respect to improperly spent funds or other misconduct.


<R05>
Sec. 77.6  Emergency procedures.

    (a) Should the Department determine that it cannot adequately 
protect assets of the Federal government available to a recipient 
organization under its letter of credit without taking remedial action 
prior to the procedures specified in Sec. 77.5, it may immediately take 
remedial action subject to the subsequent completion of those 
procedures.
    (b) Where the Department has taken remedial action as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, it will notify the recipient organization 
orally of the remedial action within one business day of its imposition 
and in writing

[[Page 270]]

within seven business days of its imposition. The written notice will 
conform to that described in Sec. 77.5(a).
    (c) After receipt of the written notice, the recipient organization 
will have the same opportunity to respond as described in Sec. 
77.5(b)(1).
    (d) The Department will issue a final decision in writing no later 
than twenty days following receipt of any response submitted by the 
recipient organization.

excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the authority 
head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the 
defendant an opportunity to answer.

filing responses thereto has expired, except upon consent of the parties 
or following a hearing on the motion, but may overrule or deny such 
motion without awaiting a response.
    (e) The ALJ shall make a reasonable effort to dispose of all 
outstanding motions prior to the beginning of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 79.29  Sanctions.

    (a) The ALJ may sanction a person, including any party or 
representative, for--
    (1) Failing to comply with an order, rule, or procedure governing 
the proceeding;
    (2) Failing to prosecute or defend an action; or
    (3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, 
orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing.
    (b) Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall reasonably relate to 
the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct.
    (c) When a party fails to comply with an order, including an order 
for taking a deposition, the production of evidence within the party's 
control, or a request for admission, the ALJ may--
    (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard 
to the information sought;
    (2) In the case of requests for admission, deem each matter of which 
an admission is requested to be admitted;
    (3) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from 
introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying upon, testimony 
relating to the information sought; and

[[Page 282]]

    (4) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the 
party failing to comply with such request.
    (d) If a party fails to prosecute or defend an action under this 
part commenced by service of a notice of hearing, the ALJ may dismiss 
the action or may issue an initial decision imposing penalties and 
assessments.
    (e) The ALJ may refuse to consider any motion, request, response, 
brief or other document which is not filed in a timely fashion.


<R05>
Sec. 79.30  The hearing and burden of proof.

    (a) The ALJ shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to 
determine whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or 
assessment under Sec. 79.3 and, if so, the appropriate amount of any 
such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or 
mitigating factors.
    (b) The authority shall prove defendant's liability and any 
aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any 
mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise ordered 
by the ALJ for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 79.31  Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

    (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and 
assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should 
evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and 
should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the 
penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs 
of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to 
deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages 
and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.
    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those 
that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the 
amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the 
misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or 
statements) charged in the complaint:
    (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or 
statements;
    (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;
    (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the 
misconduct;
    (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or 
benefit falsely claimed;
    (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the 
misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of 
investigation;
    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the 
amount of the Government's loss;
    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national 
defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management 
of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact 
on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;
    (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or 
similar misconduct;
    (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
    (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the 
misconduct or in concealing it;
    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the 
defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or 
attempted to preclude such misconduct;
    (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an 
investigation of the misconduct;
    (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting 
other wrongdoers;
    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of 
the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent 
of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar 
transactions;
    (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, 
or administrative proceeding, to have engaged in similar misconduct or 
to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of 
a State, directly or indirectly; and

[[Page 283]]

    (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the 
same or similar misconduct.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or 
the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given 
case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and 
assessments are imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 79.32  Location of hearing.

    (a) The hearing may be held--
    (1) In any judicial district of the United States in which the 
defendant resides or transacts business;
    (2) In any judicial district of the United States in which the claim 
or statement in issue was made; or
    (3) In such other place as may be agreed upon by the defendant and 
the ALJ.
    (b) Each party shall have the opportunity to present argument with 
respect to the location of the hearing.
    (c) The hearing shall be held at the place and at the time ordered 
by the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 79.33  Witnesses.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony 
at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or 
affirmation.
    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the 
form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement 
must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address 
of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other 
parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. 
Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing 
and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in Sec. 
79.22(a).
    (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and 
order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) 
make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment 
of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect 
witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
    (d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-
examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the 
facts.
    (e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on 
matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or 
her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-
examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be 
conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading 
questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or 
a witness identified with an adverse party.
    (f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded 
so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule 
does not authorize exclusion of--
    (1) A party who is an individual;
    (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or 
employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated by 
the party's representative; or
    (3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential 
to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the 
Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 79.34  Evidence.

    (a) The ALJ shall determine the admissibility of evidence.
    (b) Except as provided in this part, the ALJ shall not be bound by 
the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal 
Rules of Evidence where appropriate, e.g., to exclude unreliable 
evidence.
    (c) The ALJ shall exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.
    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, 
confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged 
under Federal law.
    (f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement shall be 
inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of 
Evidence.

[[Page 284]]

    (g) The ALJ shall permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses 
and evidence.

    (a) The hearing will be recorded and transcribed. Transcripts may be 
obtained following the hearing from the ALJ at a cost not to exceed the 
actual cost of duplication.
    (b) The transcript of testimony, exhibits and other evidence 
admitted at the hearing, and all papers and requests filed in the 
proceeding constitute the record for the decision by the ALJ and the 
authority head.

reasonable fee) by anyone, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ pursuant 
to Sec. 79.24.

party receives the transcript of the hearing or, if applicable, the 
stipulated record. Such briefs may be accompanied by proposed findings 
of fact and conclusions of law. The ALJ may permit the parties to file 
reply briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 79.37  Initial decision.

    (a) The ALJ shall issue an initial decision based only on the 
record, which shall contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, and 
the amount of any penalties and assessments imposed.

following issues:

any portions thereof, violate Sec. 79.3;

serve all parties with a statement describing the right of any defendant 
determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file a 
motion for reconsideration with the ALJ or a notice of appeal with the 
authority head. If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this 
paragraph, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the 
delay and shall set a new deadline.
    (d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the 
authority head, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision 
is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final 
decision of the authority head and shall be final and binding on the 
parties 30 days after it is issued by the ALJ.

been erroneously decided and the nature of the alleged errors. Such 
motion shall be accompanied by a supporting brief.
    (c) Responses to such motions shall be allowed only upon request of 
the ALJ.
    (d) No party may file a motion for reconsideration of an initial

reconsideration.
    (e) The ALJ may dispose of a motion for reconsideration by denying 
it or by issuing a revised initial decision.
    (f) If the ALJ denies a motion for reconsideration, the initial

the motion, unless the initial decision is timely appealed to the

[[Page 285]]

authority head in accordance with Sec. 79.39.
    (g) If the ALJ issues a revised initial decision, that decision 
shall constitute the final decision of the authority head and shall be 
final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued, unless it 
is timely appealed to the authority head in accordance with Sec. 79.39.


<R05>
Sec. 79.39  Appeal to authority head.

    (a) Any defendant who has filed a timely answer and who is 
determined in an initial decision to be liable for a civil penalty or 
assessment may appeal such decision to the authority head by filing a 
notice of appeal with the authority head in accordance with this 
section.

appeal must be filed within 30 days after the ALJ denies the motion or

appeal must be filed within 30 days after the ALJ issues the initial 
decision.
    (4) The authority head may extend the initial 30-day period for an 
additional 30-days if the defendant files with the authority head a 
request for an extension within the initial 30 day period and shows good 
cause.
    (c) If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the

    (h) In reviewing the initial decision, the authority head shall not 
consider any objection that was not raised before the ALJ unless a 
demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure 
to raise the objection.
    (i) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the authority 
head that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is material

evidence at such hearing, the authority head shall remand the matter to 
the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence.

    Authority: Sec. 602, 78 Stat. 252; 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the ``Act'') 
to the end that no person in the United States shall; on the ground of 
race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance 
from the Department of Health and Human Services.

(Sec. 601, Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252 (42 U.S.C. 2000d))

[29 FR 16298, Dec. 4, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17982, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 80.2  Application of this regulation.

    This regulation applies to any program for which Federal financial 
assistance is authorized to be extended to a recipient under a law 
administered by the Department, including the Federal assisted programs 
and activities listed in appendix A to this part. It applies to money 
paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance 
extended after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an 
application approved prior to such effective date. This regulation does 
not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or 
guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other 
assistance extended before the effective date of this regulation, (c) 
the use of any assistance by any individual who is the ultimate 
beneficiary under any such program, or (d) any employment practice, 
under any such program, or any employer, employment agency, or labor 
organization, except to the extent described in Sec. 80.3. The fact that 
a type of Federal assistance is not listed in appendix A to this part 
shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a 
program is not covered. Federal financial assistance under statutes now 
in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice 
published in the Federal Register.

(Secs. 602, 604, Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 253 (42 U.S.C. 
2000d-1, 2000d-3))

[38 FR 17979, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 80.3  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. No person in the United States shall, on the ground of 
race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under any program to which this part applies.
    (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient 
under any program to which this part applies may not, directly or 
through contractual or other arrangements, on ground of race, color, or 
national origin:
    (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an 
individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, 
from that provided to others under the program;
    (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in 
any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or 
other benefit under the program;
    (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, 
financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
    (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining 
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, 
membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet 
in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;

[[Page 288]]

    (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an 
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under 
the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as 
an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section).
    (vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a 
planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.
    (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will 
be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be 
afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, 
directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria 
or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting 
individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national 
origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing 
accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals 
of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (3) In determining the site or location of a facilities, an 
applicant or recipient may not make selections with the effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under any programs to which this regulation 
applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the 
purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the 
accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.
    (4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other 
benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance 
shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefits 
provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal 
financial assistance.
    (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the 
generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has 
previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to 
overcome the effects of prior discrimination.
    (ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient 
in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the 
effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by 
persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (c) Employment practices. (1) Where a primary objective of the 
Federal financial assistance to a program to which this regulation 
applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not (directly or 
through contractual or other arrangements) subject an individual to 
discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its 
employment practices under such program (including recruitment or 
recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, 
demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and 
use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the 
Federal financial assistance is (i) to reduce the employment of such 
individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence 
needs, (ii) to assist such individuals through employment to meet 
expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education 
or training, (iii) to provide work experience which contributes to the 
education or training of such individuals, or (iv) to provide 
remunerative activity to such individuals who because of handicaps 
cannot be readily absorbed in the competive labor market. The following,

objective:

    (b) Work-study under the Vocational Education Act of 1963, as 
amended, 20 U.S.C. 1371-1374.

[[Page 289]]

    (c) Programs assisted under laws listed in Appendix A to this part 
as respects employment opportunities provided thereunder, or in 
facilities provided thereunder, which are limited, or for which 
preference is given, to students, fellows, or other persons in training 
for the same or related employments.
    (d) Assistance to rehabilitation facilities under the Vocational 
Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 32-34, 41a and 41b.
    (2) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any 
such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Part III of 
Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.
    (3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is 
not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, 
color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient 
or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the ground of race, 
color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, 
to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under 
any program to which this regulation applies, the foregoing provisions 
of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the employment practices of the 
recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent 
necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory 
treatment of, beneficiaries.
    (d) Indian Health and Cuban Refugee Services. An individual shall 
not be deemed subjected to discrimination by reason of his exclusion 
from the benefits of a program limited by Federal law to individuals of 
a particular race, color, or national origin different from his.
    (e) Medical emergencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 
this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be 
deemed to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if 
immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is 
necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health, and 
such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a 
medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) 
of this section.

Sec. 80.4  Assurances required.

    (a) General. (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance 
to carry out a program to which this part applies, except a program to 
which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for 
Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition 
to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance 
pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance 
that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in 
compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In 
the case of an application for Federal financial assistance to provide 
real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the 
recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for 
the period during which the real property or structures are used for a 
purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for 
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. 
In the case of personal property the assurance shall obligate the 
recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession 
of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the 
recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is 
extended pursuant to the application. The responsible Department 
official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each 
program, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of 
subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in 
interest, and other participants in the program. Any such assurance 
shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek 
its judicial enforcement.
    (2) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a 
transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal 
Government the instrument effecting or recording the

[[Page 290]]

transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure 
nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used 
for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or 
for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or 
benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved but property is 
improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to 
include such a covenant to any subsequent transfer of the property. 
Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such 
covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be 
reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event 
of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible 
Department official, such a condition and right of reverter is 
appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and 
to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of 
real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real 
property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement 
of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the 
property was transferred, the responsible Department official may agree, 
upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such 
financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forbear 
the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of 
such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.
    (b) Continuing State programs. Every application by a State or a 
State agency to carry out a program involving continuing Federal 
financial assistance to which this regulation applies (including the 
Federal financial assistance listed in Part 2 of Appendix A to this 
part) shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any 
Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or 
be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a 
new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements 
imposed by or pursuant to this regulation, and (2) provide or be 
accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the 
program as are found by the responsible Department official to give 
reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal 
financial assistance under such program will comply with all 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to this regulation.
    (c) Elementary and secondary schools. The requirements of paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary 
school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school 
or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the 
United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and 
provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any 
future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the 
desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible 
Department official determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of 
the Act and this part, at the earliest practicable time, and provides 
reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in any case of 
continuing Federal financial assistance the responsible Department 
official may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may 
be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes 
of the Act and the regulations in this part. In any case in which a 
final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of 
such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, 
such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any 
future modification of such order.
    (d) Assurance from institutions. (1) In the case of any application 
for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education 
(including assistance for construction, for research, for special 
training project, for student loans or for any other purpose), the 
assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices 
and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.
    (2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher 
education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance 
relates to the institution's practices with respect

[[Page 291]]

to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or 
clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the 
provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be 
applicable to the entire institution unless the applicant establishes, 
to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the 
institution's practices in designated parts or programs of the 
institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of the 
institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the 
beneficiaries of or participants in such program. If in any such case 
the assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a 
facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility 
and to facilities operated in connection therewith.

(Secs. 601, 602, Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252 (42 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 80.5  Illustrative application.

    The following examples will illustrate the programs aided by Federal 
financial assistance of the Department. (In all cases the discrimination 
prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national 
origin prohibited by Title VI of the Act and this regulation, as a 
condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance).
    (a) In federally assisted programs for the provision of health or 
welfare services, discrimination in the selection or eligibility of 
individuals to receive the services, and segregation or other 
discriminatory practices in the manner of providing them, are 
prohibited. This prohibition extends to all facilities and services 
provided by the grantee under the program or, if the grantee is a State, 
by a political subdivision of the State. It extends also to services 
purchased or otherwise obtained by the grantee (or political 
subdivision) from hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and similar 
institutions for beneficiaries of the program, and to the facilities in 
which such services are provided, subject, however, to the provisions of 
Sec. 80.3(e).
    (b) In federally-affected area assistance (Pub. L. 815 and Pub. L. 
874) for construction aid and for general support of the operation of 
elementary or secondary schools, or in more limited support to such 
schools such as for the acquisition of equipment, the provision of 
vocational education, or the provision of guidance and counseling 
services, discrimination by the recipient school district in any of its 
elementary or secondary schools in the admission of students, or in the 
treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is 
prohibited. In this and the following illustrations the prohibition of 
discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes 
the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the 
availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or 
other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.
    (c) In a research, training, demonstration, or other grant to a 
university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, 
discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the 
graduate school is prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire 
university unless it satisfies the responsible Department official that 
practices with respect to other parts or programs of the university will 
not interfere, directly or indirectly, with fulfillment of the assurance 
required with respect to the graduate school.
    (d) In a training grant to a hospital or other nonacademic 
institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of 
individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during 
their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an 
institution discrimination is prohibited with respect to any educational 
activity and any provision of medical or other services and any 
financial aid to individuals incident to the program.
    (e) In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the 
provision of health, educational or welfare services, assurances will be 
required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the 
same extent that discrimination would be prohibited as a condition of 
Federal operating grants for the support of such services. Thus,

[[Page 292]]

as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research, or 
other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be 
required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or 
treatment of students. In case of hospital construction grants the 
assurance will apply to patients, to interns, residents, student nurses, 
and other trainees, and to the privilege of physicians, dentists, and 
other professionally qualified persons to practice in the hospital, and 
will apply to the entire facility for which, or for a part of which, the 
grant is made, and to facilities operated in connection therewith. In 
other construction grants the assurances required will similarly be 
adapted to the nature of the activities to be conducted in the 
facilities for construction of which the grants have been authorized by 
Congress.
    (f) Upon transfers of real or personal surplus property for health 
or educational uses, discrimination is prohibited to the same extent as 
in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the 
provision of equipment for like purposes.
    (g) Each applicant for a grant for the construction of educational 
television facilities is required to provide an assurance that it will, 
in its broadcast services, give due consideration to the interests of 
all significant racial or ethnic groups within the population to be 
served by the applicant.
    (h) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring 
about indirectly what this regulation forbids it to accomplish directly. 
Thus, a State, in selecting or approving projects or sites for the 
construction of public libraries which will receive Federal financial 
assistance, may not base its selections or approvals on criteria which 
have the effect of defeating or of substantially impairing 
accomplishments of the objectives of the Federal assistance as respects 
individuals of a particular race, color or national origin.
    (i) In some situations, even though past discriminatory practices 
attributable to a recipient or applicant have been abandoned, the 
consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability 
of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient 
under Sec. 80.6(d), to provide information as to the availability of the 
program or activity and the rights of beneficiaries under this 
regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become 
necessary under the requirement stated in (i) of Sec. 80.3(b) (6) for 
such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the 
benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously 
subject to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, 
of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections 
which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are 
adequately served.
    (j) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used 
discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or 
activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some 
racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances, an applicant or 
recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or 
national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely 
available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, 
where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular 
racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment 
policies to make its program better known and more readily available to 
such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more 
adequate service.

Sec. 80.6  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. The responsible Department official 
shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of 
recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide 
assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with this part.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and 
submit to the responsible Department official or his designee timely, 
complete and accurate compliance reports at such

[[Page 293]]

times, and in such form and containing such information, as the 
responsible Department official or his designee may determine to be 
necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied 
or is complying with this part. For example, recipients should have 
available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing the extent 
to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of and 
participants in federally-assisted programs. In the case of any program 
under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to 
any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such 
compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to 
enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this 
part.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
access by the responsible Department official or his designee during 
normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other 
sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to 
ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a 
recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, 
institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail 
or refuse to furnish this information the recipient shall so certify in 
its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the 
information. Asserted considerations of privacy or confidentiality may 
not operate to bar the Department from evaluating or seeking to enforce 
compliance with this part. Information of a confidential nature obtained 
in connection with compliance evaluation or enforcement shall not be 
disclosed except where necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or 
where otherwise required by law.
    (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient 
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this 
regulation and its applicability to the program for which the recipient 
receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information 
available to them in such manner, as the responsible Department official 
finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against 
discrimination assured them by the Act and this regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 80.7  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. The responsible Department official 
or his designee shall from time to time review the practices of 
recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific 
class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by 
this part may by himself or by a representative file with the 
responsible Department official or his designee a written complaint. A 
complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the 
alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the 
responsible Department official or his designee.
    (c) Investigations. The responsible Department official or his 
designee will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, 
report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure 
to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where 
appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the 
recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with 
this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to 
whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this 
part, the responsible Department official or his designee will so inform 
the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever 
possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved 
by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in Sec. 80.8.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section the responsible Department official or 
his designee will

[[Page 294]]

so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or 
other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against 
any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or 
privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he 
has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner 
in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this part. The identity 
of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct 
of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising 
thereunder.

Sec. 80.8  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure 
to comply with this regulation, and if the noncompliance or threatened 
noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with 
this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal 
to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other 
means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not 
limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a 
recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any 
rights of the United States under any law of the United States 
(including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other 
contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State 
or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 80.4. If an applicant fails or refuses 
to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 80.4 or otherwise fails or 
refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that 
section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with 
the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall 
not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency 
of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the 
Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such 
proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an 
application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.
    (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating or refusing to 
grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective 
until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant 
or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance 
cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express 
finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by 
the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or 
pursuant to this part, (3) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary 
has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the 
Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full 
written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any 
action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue 
Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular 
political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to 
whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to 
the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has 
been so found.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the 
responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be 
secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been 
notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to 
effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the 
mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this 
period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade 
the recipient or other person to comply with the regulation and to

[[Page 295]]

take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

Sec. 80.9  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required by Sec. 80.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected 
applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or 
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision 
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the 
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either 
(1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice 
within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible 
Department official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) 
advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been 
set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so 
fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The 
complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the 
hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit 
written information and argument for the record. The failure of an 
applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been 
set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under 
section 602 of the Act and Sec. 80.8(c) of this regulation and consent 
to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be 
filed as the record.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices 
of the Department in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the responsible 
Department official unless he determines that the convenience of the 
applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another place 
be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing examiner designated 
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act).
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be 
represented by counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and in accordance with 
such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this 
section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices 
subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, 
taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for 
findings, and other related matters. Both the Department and the 
applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant 
evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as 
determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or 
during the hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee 
considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or 
requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, 
attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by this 
part, may be reimbursed for his travel and actual expenses of attendance 
in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized 
travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official 
business.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to 
assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject 
testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably 
necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may 
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All 
documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be 
open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to 
refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A 
transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the 
substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be 
based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

[[Page 296]]

    (e) Consolidated or Joint Hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this 
regulation with respect to two or more programs to which this part 
applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or 
more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the 
Act, the responsible Department official may, by agreement with such 
other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct 
of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such 
hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final 
decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall 
be made in accordance with Sec. 80.10.

    (a) Decisions by hearing examiners. After a hearing is held by a 
hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial 
decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his 
recommended findings and proposed decision to the reviewing authority 
for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or 
certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the 
complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this 
paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing 
examiner, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for the Department 
may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by 
the responsible Department official, file with the reviewing authority 
exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. Upon the 
filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the 
initial decision and issue its own decision thereof including the 
reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision 
shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority. 
Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision 
or it reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph 
(a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given 
reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written 
statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the 
reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or 
recipient and to the complainant, if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 80.9(a) the reviewing authority shall 
make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a hearing 
examiner for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy of 
such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, 
and to the complainant, if any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing examiner or 
reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each finding, 
conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement 
or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is 
found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Review in certain cases by the Secretary. If the Secretary has 
not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraph (a), 
(b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for 
the Department may request the Secretary to review a decision of the 
Reviewing Authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the 
responsible Department official. Such review is not a matter of right 
and shall be granted only where the Secretary determines there are 
special and important reasons therefor. The Secretary may grant or deny 
such request, in whole or in part. He may also review such a decision 
upon his own motion in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the 
responsible Department official. In the absence of a review under this 
paragraph, a final decision referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) 
of this section shall become the final decision of the Department when 
the Secretary transmits it as such to Congressional committees with the 
report required under section 602 of the

[[Page 297]]

Act. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the 
Reviewing Authority or to request review under this paragraph shall not 
be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose 
of obtaining judicial review.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and 
may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are 
consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this 
regulation, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal 
financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be 
extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined 
by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance 
given by it pursuant to this regulation, or to have otherwise failed to 
comply with this regulation unless and until it corrects its 
noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it 
will fully comply with this regulation.
    (g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that 
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with 
this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply 
with this part. An elementary or secondary school or school system which 
is unable to file an assurance of compliance with Sec. 80.3 shall be 
restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance, if 
it files a court order or a plan for desegregation which meets the 
requirements of Sec. 80.4(c), and provides reasonable assurance that it 
will comply with the court order or plan.
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the responsible Department official to restore fully its 
eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request 
shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or 
recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. 
If the responsible Department official determines that those 
requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.
    (3) If the responsible Department official denies any such request, 
the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in 
writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. 
It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on 
the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the 
responsible Department official. The applicant or recipient will be 
restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it 
satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While 
proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by 
the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in 
effect.

[[Page 298]]

this regulation, except that nothing in this regulation shall be deemed 
to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any 
such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior 
to the effective date of this regulation. Nothing in this regulation, 
however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including 
future amendments thereof): (1) The ``Standards for a Merit System of 
Personnel Administration,'' issued jointly by the Secretaries of 
Defense, of Health and Human Services, and of Labor, 45 CFR Part 70; (2)

regulations or instructions, insofar as such Order, regulations, or 
instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin in any program or situation to which this regulation is 
inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground; or (3) 
requirements for Emergency School Assistance as published in 35 FR 13442 
and codified as 45 CFR Part 181.
    (b) Forms and instructions. The responsible Department official 
shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and 
detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The responsible Department 
official may from time to time assign to officials of the Department, or 
to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the 
consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection 
with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI of the Act and this 
regulation (other than responsibility for review as provided in Sec. 
80.10(e)), including the achievements of effective coordination and 
maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch 
of the Government in the application of Title VI and this regulation to 
similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, 
determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another 
Department or Agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility 
under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action 
had been taken by the responsible official of this Department.

  Appendix B to Part 80--Guidelines for Eliminating Discrimination and 
 Denial of Services on the Basis of Race, Color, National Origin, Sex, 
              and Handicap in Vocational Education Programs

                          I. Scope and Coverage

                      a. application of guidelines

    These Guidelines apply to recipients of any Federal financial 
assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services that offer 
or administer programs of vocational education or training. This 
includes State agency recipients.

                       b. definition of recipient

    The definition of recipient of Federal financial assistance is 
established by Department regulations implementing title VI, title IX, 
and section 504 (45 CFR 80.13(i), 86.2(h), 84.3(f).
    For the purposes of title VI:
    The term recipient means any State, political subdivision of any 
State, or instrumentality of any State or political subdivision, any 
public or private agency, institution, or organization, or other entity, 
or any individual, in any State, to whom Federal financial assistance is 
extended, directly or through another recipient, for any program, 
including any successor, assignee, or transferee thereof, but such term 
does not include any ultimate beneficiary [e.g., students] under any 
such program. (45 CFR 80.13(i)).
    For the purpose of title IX:
    Recipient means any State or political subdivision thereof, or any 
instrumentality of a State or political subdivision thereof, any public 
or private agency, institution, or organization, or other entity, or any 
person to whom Federal financial assistance is extended directly or 
through another recipient and which operates an education program or 
activity which receives or benefits from such assistance, including any 
subunit, successor, assignee, or transferee thereof. (45 CFR 86.2(h)).
    For the purposes of section 504:
    Recipient means any State or its political subdivision, any 
instrumentality of a State or its political subdivision, any public or 
private agency, institution, organization, or other entity, or any 
person to which Federal financial assistance is extended directly or 
through another recipient, including any successor, assignee, or 
transferee of a recipient, but excluding the ultimate beneficiary of the 
assistance. (45 CFR 84.3(f)).

          c. examples of recipients covered by these guidelines

    The following education agencies, when they provide vocational 
education, are examples of recipients covered by these Guidelines:
    1. The board of education of a public school district and its

study in preparation for entering the labor market.

[[Page 305]]

    4. The administrative board of a postsecondary institution, such as

         d. examples of schools to which these guidelines apply

    The following are examples of the types of schools to which these 
Guidelines apply.

comprehensive high school that offers instruction to inform, orient, or 
prepare students for vocational education at the secondary level.
    2. A vocational education facility operated by a State agency.
    3. A comprehensive high school that has a department exclusively or 
principally used for providing vocational education; or that offers at 
least one vocational program to secondary level students who are 
available for study in preparation for entering the labor market; or 
that offers adult vocational education to persons who have completed or 
left high school and who are available for study in preparation for

described in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above or the term postsecondary 
vocational education center in referring to institutions described in 
paragraphs 6 and 7 above or the term vocational education center in 
referring to any or all institutions described above.

      II. Responsibilities Assigned Only to State Agency Recipients

           a. responsibilities of all state agency recipients

    State agency recipients, in addition to complying with all other 
provisions of the Guidelines relevant to them, may not require, approve 
of, or engage in any discrimination or denial of services on the basis 
of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap in performing any of 
the following activities:
    1. Establishment of criteria or formulas for distribution of Federal 
or State funds to vocational education programs in the State;
    2. Establishment of requirements for admission to or requirements 
for the administration of vocational education programs;
    3. Approval of action by local entities providing vocational 
education. (For example, a State agency must ensure compliance with 
section IV of these Guidelines if and when it reviews a vocational 
education agency decision to create or change a geographic service 
area.);
    4. Conducting its own programs. (For example, in employing its staff 
it may not discriminate on the basis of sex or handicap.)

         b. state agencies performing oversight responsibilities

    The State agency responsible for the administration of vocational 
education programs must adopt a compliance program to prevent, identify 
and remedy discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
sex or handicap by its subrecipients. (A sub recipient, in this context, 
is a local agency or vocational education center that receives financial 
assistance through a State agency.) This compliance program must 
include:
    1. Collecting and analyzing civil rights related data and 
information that subrecipients compile for their own purposes or that 
are submitted to State and Federal officials under existing authorities;
    2. Conducting periodic compliance reviews of selected subrecipients 
(i.e., an investigation of a subrecipient to determine whether it 
engages in unlawful discrimination in any aspect of its program); upon 
finding unlawful discrimination, notifying the subrecipient of steps it 
must take to attain compliance and attempting to obtain voluntary 
compliance;
    3. Providing technical assistance upon request to subrecipients. 
This will include assisting subrecipients identify unlawful 
discrimination and instructing them in remedies for and prevention of 
such discrimination;

[[Page 306]]

    4. Periodically reporting its activities and findings under the 
foregoing paragraphs, including findings of unlawful discrimination 
under paragraph 2, immediately above, to the Office for Civil Rights.
    State agencies are not required to terminate or defer assistance to 
any subrecipient. Nor are they required to conduct hearings. The 
responsibilities of the Office for Civil Rights to collect and analyze 
data, to conduct compliance reviews, to investigate complaints and to 
provide technical assistance are not diminished or attenuated by the 
requirements of Section II of the Guidelines.

                c. statement of procedures and practices

    Within one year from the publication of these Guidelines in final 
form, each State agency recipient performing oversight responsibilities 
must submit to the Office for Civil Rights the methods of administration 
and related procedures it will follow to comply with the requirements 
described in paragraphs A and B immediately above. The Department will 
review each submission and will promptly either approve it, or return it 
to State officials for revision.

 III. Distribution of Federal Financial Assistance and Other Funds for 
                          Vocational Education

                       a. agency responsibilities

    Recipients that administer grants for vocational education must 
distribute Federal, State, or local vocational education funds so that 
no student or group of students is unlawfully denied an equal 
opportunity to benefit from vocational education on the basis of race, 
color, national origin, sex, or handicap.

                        b. distribution of funds

    Recipients may not adopt a formula or other method for the 
allocation of Federal, State, or local vocational education funds that 
has the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, sex, or handicap. However, a recipient may adopt a formula or 
other method of allocation that uses as a factor race, color, national 
origin, sex, or handicap [or an index or proxy for race, color, national 
origin, sex, or handicap e.g., number of persons receiving Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children or with limited English speaking 
ability] if the factor is included to compensate for past discrimination 
or to comply with those provisions of the Vocational Education 
Amendments of 1976 designed to assist specified protected groups.

       c. example of a pattern suggesting unlawful discrimination

    In each State it is likely that some local recipients will enroll 
greater proportions of minority students in vocational education than 
the State-wide proportion of minority students in vocational education. 
A funding formula or other method of allocation that results in such 
local recipients receiving per-pupil allocations of Federal or State 
vocational education funds lower than the State-wide average per-pupil 
allocation will be presumed unlawfully discriminatory.

         d. distribution through competitive grants or contracts

    Each State agency that establishes criteria for awarding competitive 
vocational education grants or contracts must establish and apply the 
criteria without regard to the race, color, national origin, sex, or 
handicap of any or all of a recipient's students, except to compensate 
for past discrimination.

    e. application processes for competitive or discretionary grants

    State agencies must disseminate information needed to satisfy the 
requirements of any application process for competitive or discretionary 
grants so that all recipients, including those having a high percentage 
of minority or handicapped students, are informed of and able to seek 
funds. State agencies that provide technical assistance for the 
completion of the application process must provide such assistance 
without discrimination against any one recipient or class of recipients.

     f. alteration of fund distribution to provide equal opportunity

    If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a recipient's system for 
distributing vocational education funds unlawfully discriminates on the 
basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap, it will require 
the recipient to adopt an alternative nondiscriminatory method of 
distribution. The Office for Civil Rights may also require the recipient 
to compensate for the effects of its past unlawful discrimination in the 
distribution of funds.

  IV. Access and Admission of Students To Vocational Education Programs

                      a. recipient responsibilities

    Criteria controlling student eligibility for admission to vocational 
education schools, facilities and programs may not unlawfully 
discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or 
handicap. A recipient may not develop, impose, maintain, approve, or 
implement such discriminatory admissions criteria.

                b. site selection for vocational schools

    State and local recipients may not select or approve a site for a 
vocational education facility for the purpose or with the effect of

[[Page 307]]

excluding, segregating, or otherwise discriminating against students on 
the basis of race, color, or national origin. Recipients must locate 
vocational education facilities at sites that are readily accessible to 
both nonminority and minority communities, and that do not tend to 
identify the facility or program as intended for nonminority or minority 
students.

 c. eligibility for admission to vocational education centers based on 
                                residence

    Recipients may not establish, approve or maintain geographic 
boundaries for a vocational education center service area or attendance 
zone, (hereinafter service area), that unlawfully exclude students on 
the basis of race, color, or national origin. The Office for Civil 
Rights will presume, subject to rebuttal, that any one or combination of 
the following circumstances indicates that the boundaries of a given 
service area are unlawfully constituted:
    1. A school system or service area contiguous to the given service 
area, contains minority or nonminority students in substantially greater 
proportion than the given service area;
    2. A substantial number of minority students who reside outside the 
given vocational education center service area, and who are not eligible 
for the center reside, nonetheless, as close to the center as a 
substantial number of non-minority students who are eligible for the 
center;
    3. The over-all vocational education program of the given service 
area in comparison to the over-all vocational education program of a 
contiguous school system or service area enrolling a substantially 
greater proportion of minority students: (a) Provides its students with 
a broader range of curricular offerings, facilities and equipment; or 
(b) provides its graduates greater opportunity for employment in jobs: 
(i) For which there is a demonstrated need in the community or region; 
(ii) that pay higher entry level salaries or wages; or (iii) that are 
generally acknowledged to offer greater prestige or status.

d. additions and renovations to existing vocational education facilities

    A recipient may not add to, modify, or renovate the physical plant 
of a vocational education facility in a manner that creates, maintains, 
or increases student segregation on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, sex, or handicap.

e. remedies for violations of site selection and geographic service area 
                              requirements

    If the conditions specified in paragraphs IV, A, B, C, or D, 
immediately above, are found and not rebutted by proof of 
nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil rights will require the 
recipient(s) to submit a plan to remedy the discrimination. The 
following are examples of steps that may be included in the plan, where 
necessary to overcome the discrimination: (1) Redrawing of the 
boundaries of the vocational education center's service area to include 
areas unlawfully excluded and/or to exclude areas unlawfully included; 
(2) provision of transportation to students residing in areas unlawfully 
excluded; (3) provision of additional programs and services to students 
who would have been eligible for attendance at the vocational education 
center but for the discriminatory service area or site selection; (4) 
reassignment of students; and (5) construction of new facilities or 
expansion of existing facilities.

 f. eligibility for admission to secondary vocational education centers 
          based on numerical limits imposed on sending schools

    A recipient may not adopt or maintain a system for admission to a 
secondary vocational education center or program that limits admission 
to a fixed number of students from each sending school included in the 
center's service area if such a system disproportionately excludes 
students from the center on the basis of race, sex, national origin or 
handicap. (Example: Assume 25 percent of a school district's high school 
students are black and that most of those black students are enrolled in 
one high school; the white students, 75 percent of the district's total 
enrollment, are generally enrolled in the five remaining high schools. 
This paragraph prohibits a system of admission to the secondary 
vocational education center that limits eligibility to a fixed and equal 
number of students from each of the district's six high schools.)

   g. remedies for violation of eligibility based on numerical limits 
                              requirements

    If the Office for Civil Rights finds a violation of paragraph F, 
above, the recipient must implement an alternative system of admissions 
that does not disproportionately exclude students on the basis of race, 
color, national origin, sex, or handicap.

 h. eligibility for admission to vocational education centers, branches 
                  or annexes based upon student option

    A vocational education center, branch or annex, open to all students 
in a service area and predominantly enrolling minority students or 
students of one race, national origin or sex, will be presumed 
unlawfully segregated if: (1) It was established by a recipient for 
members of one race, national origin or sex; or (2) it has since its 
construction been attended primarily by members of one race, national 
origin or sex; or (3) most of its

[[Page 308]]

program offerings have traditionally been selected predominantely by 
members of one race, national origin or sex.

     i. remedies for facility segregation under student option plans

    If the conditions specified in paragraph IV-H are found and not 
rebutted by proof of nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil Rights will 
require the recipient(s) to submit a plan to remedy the segregation. The 
following are examples of steps that may be included in the plan, where 
necessary to overcome the discrimination:
    (1) elimination of program duplication in the segregated facility 
and other proximate vocational facilities; (2) relocation or 
``clustering'' of programs or courses; (3) adding programs and courses 
that traditionally have been identified as intended for members of a 
particular race, national origin or sex to schools that have 
traditionally served members of the other sex or traditionally served 
persons of a different race or national origin; (4) merger of programs 
into one facility through school closings or new construction; (5) 
intensive outreach recruitment and counseling; (6) providing free 
transportation to students whose enrollment would promote desegregation.
    [Paragraph J omitted]

 k. eligibility based on evaluation of each applicant under admissions 
                                criteria

    Recipients may not judge candidates for admission to vocational 
education programs on the basis of criteria that have the effect of 
disproportionately excluding persons of a particular race, color, 
national origin, sex, or handicap. However, if a recipient can 
demonstrate that such criteria have been validated as essential to 
participation in a given program and that alternative equally valid 
criteria that do not have such a disproportionate adverse effect are 
unavailable, the criteria will be judged nondiscriminatory. Examples of 
admissions criteria that must meet this test are past academic 
performance, record of disciplinary infractions, counselors' approval, 
teachers' recommendations, interest inventories, high school diplomas 
and standardized tests, such as the Test of Adult Basic Education 
(TABE).
    An introductory, preliminary, or exploratory course may not be 
established as a prerequisite for admission to a program unless the 
course has been and is available without regard to race, color, national 
origin, sex, and handicap. However, a course that was formerly only 
available on a discriminatory basis may be made a prerequisite for 
admission to a program if the recipient can demonstrate that: (a) the 
course is essential to participation in the program; and (b) the course 
is presently available to those seeking enrollment for the first time 
and to those formerly excluded.

l. eligibility of national origin minority persons with limited english 
                             language skills

    Recipients may not restrict an applicant's admission to vocational 
education programs because the applicant, as a member of a national 
origin minority with limited English language skills, cannot participate 
in and benefit from vocational instruction to the same extent as a 
student whose primary language is English. It is the responsibility of 
the recipient to identify such applicants and assess their ability to 
participate in vocational instruction.
    Acceptable methods of identification include: (1) Identification by 
administrative staff, teachers, or parents of secondary level students; 
(2) identification by the student in postsecondary or adult programs; 
and (3) appropriate diagnostic procedures, if necessary.
    Recipients must take steps to open all vocational programs to these 
national origin minority students. A recipient must demonstrate that a 
concentration of students with limited English language skills in one or 
a few programs is not the result of discriminatory limitations upon the 
opportunities available to such students.

 m. remedial action in behalf of persons with limited english language 
                                 skills

    If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a recipient has denied 
national origin minority persons admission to a vocational school or 
program because of their limited English language skills or has assigned 
students to vocational programs solely on the basis of their limited 
English language skills, the recipient will be required to submit a 
remedial plan that insures national origin minority students equal 
access to vocational education programs.

                n. equal access for handicapped students

    Recipients may not deny handicapped students access to vocational 
education programs or courses because of architectural or equipment 
barriers, or because of the need for related aids and services or 
auxiliary aids. If necessary, recipients must: (1) Modify instructional 
equipment; (2) modify or adapt the manner in which the courses are 
offered; (3) house the program in facilities that are readily accessible 
to mobility impaired students or alter facilities to make them readily 
accessible to mobility impaired students; and (4) provide auxiliary aids 
that effectively make lectures and necessary materials available to 
postsecondary handicapped students; (5) provide related aids or services 
that assure secondary students an appropriate education.

[[Page 309]]

    Academic requirements that the recipient can demonstrate are 
essential to a program of instruction or to any directly related 
licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory. However, 
where possible, a recipient must adjust those requirements to the needs 
of individual handicapped students.
    Access to vocational programs or courses may not be denied 
handicapped students on the ground that employment opportunities in any 
occupation or profession may be more limited for handicapped persons 
than for non-handicapped persons.

                         o. public notification

    Prior to the beginning of each school year, recipients must advise 
students, parents, employees and the general public that all vocational 
opportunities will be offered without regard to race, color, national 
origin, sex, or handicap. Announcement of this policy of non-
discrimination may be made, for example, in local newspapers, recipient 
publications and/or other media that reach the general public, program 
beneficiaries, minorities (including national origin minorities with 
limited English language skills), women, and handicapped persons. A 
brief summary of program offerings and admission criteria should be 
included in the announcement; also the name, address and telephone 
number of the person designated to coordinate Title IX and Section 504 
compliance activity.
    If a recipient's service area contains a community of national 
origin minority persons with limited English language skills, public 
notification materials must be disseminated to that community in its 
language and must state that recipients will take steps to assure that 
the lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission 
and participation in vocational education programs.

                V. Counseling and Prevocational Programs

                      a. recipient responsibilities

    Recipients must insure that their counseling materials and 
activities (including student program selection and career/employment 
selection), promotional, and recruitment efforts do not discriminate on 
the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.

                 b. counseling and prospects for success

    Recipients that operate vocational education programs must insure 
that counselors do not direct or urge any student to enroll in a 
particular career or program, or measure or predict a student's 
prospects for success in in any career or program based upon the 
student's race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. Recipients may 
not counsel handicapped students toward more restrictive career 
objectives than nonhandicapped students with similar abilities and 
interests. If a vocational program disproportionately enrolls male or 
female students, minority or nonminority students, or handicapped 
students, recipients must take steps to insure that the disproportion 
does not result from unlawful discrimination in counseling activities.

                    c. student recruitment activities

    Recipients must conduct their student recruitment activities so as 
not to exclude or limit opportunities on the basis of race, color, 
national origin, sex, or handicap. Where recruitment activities involve 
the presentation or portrayal of vocational and career opportunities, 
the curricula and programs described should cover a broad range of 
occupational opportunities and not be limited on the basis of the race, 
color, national origin, sex, or handicap of the students or potential 
students to whom the presentation is made. Also, to the extent possible, 
recruiting teams should include persons of different races, national 
origins, sexes, and handicaps.

   d. counseling of students with limited english-speaking ability or 
                           hearing impairments

    Recipients must insure that counselors can effectively communicate 
with national origin minority students with limited English language 
skills and with students who have hearing impairments. This requirement 
may be satisfied by having interpreters available.

                        e. promotional activities

    Recipients may not undertake promotional efforts (including 
activities of school officials, counselors, and vocational staff) in a 
manner that creates or perpetuates stereotypes or limitations based on 
race, color, national origin, sex or handicap. Examples of promotional 
efforts are career days, parents' night, shop demonstrations, 
visitations by groups of prospective students and by representatives 
from business and industry. Materials that are part of promotional 
efforts may not create or perpetuate stereotypes through text or 
illustration. To the extent possible they should portray males or 
females, minorities or handicapped persons in programs and occupations 
in which these groups traditionally have not been represented. If a 
recipient's service area contains a community of national origin 
minority persons with limited English language skills, promotional 
literature must be distributed to that community in its language.

[[Page 310]]

 VI. Equal Opportunity in the Vocational Education Instructional Setting

               a. accommodations for handicapped students

    Recipients must place secondary level handicapped students in the 
regular educational environment of any vocational education program to 
the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the student unless it can 
be demonstrated that the education of the handicapped person in the 
regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services 
cannot be achieved satisfactorily. Handicapped students may be placed in 
a program only after the recipient satisfies the provisions of the 
Department's Regulation, 45 CFR Part 84, relating to evaluation, 
placement, and procedural safeguards. If a separate class or facility is 
identifiable as being for handicapped persons, the facility, the 
programs, and the services must be comparable to the facilities, 
programs, and services offered to nonhandicapped students.

                     b. student financial assistance

    Recipients may not award financial assistance in the form of loans, 
grants, scholarships, special funds, subsidies, compensation for work, 
or prizes to vocational education students on the basis of race, color, 
national origin, sex, or handicap, except to overcome the effects of 
past discrimination. Recipients may administer sex restricted financial 
assistance where the assistance and restriction are established by will, 
trust, bequest, or any similar legal instrument, if the overall effect 
of all financial assistance awarded does not discriminate on the basis 
of sex. Materials and information used to notify students of 
opportunities for financial assistance may not contain language or 
examples that would lead applicants to believe the assistance is 
provided on a discriminatory basis. If a recipient's service area 
contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited 
English language skills, such information must be disseminated to that 
community in its language.

  c. housing in residential postsecondary vocational education centers

    Recipients must extend housing opportunities without discrimination 
based on race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. This obligation 
extends to recipients that provide on-campus housing and/or that have 
agreements with providers of off-campus housing. In particular, a 
recipient postsecondary vocational education program that provides on-
campus or off-campus housing to its nonhandicapped students must 
provide, at the same cost and under the same conditions, comparable 
convenient and accessible housing to handicapped students.

                        d. comparable facilities

    Recipients must provide changing rooms, showers, and other 
facilities for students of one sex that are comparable to those provided 
to students of the other sex. This may be accomplished by alternating 
use of the same facilities or by providing separate, comparable 
facilities.
    Such facilities must be adapted or modified to the extent necessary 
to make the vocational education program readily accessible to 
handicapped persons.

 VII. Work Study, Cooperative Vocational Education, Job Placement, and 
                           Apprentice Training

 a. responsibilities in cooperative vocational education programs, work-
               study programs, and job placement programs

    A recipient must insure that: (a) It does not discriminate against 
its students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or 
handicap in making available opportunities in cooperative education, 
work study and job placement programs; and (b) students participating in 
cooperative education, work study and job placement programs are not 
discriminated against by employers or pro spective employers on the 
basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap in recruitment, 
hiring, placement, assignment to work tasks, hours of employment, levels 
of responsibility, and in pay.
    If a recipient enters into a written agreement for the referral or 
assignment of students to an employer, the agreement must contain an 
assurance from the employer that students will be accepted and assigned 
to jobs and otherwise treated without regard to race, color, national 
origin, sex, or handicap.
    Recipients may not honor any employer's request for students who are 
free of handicaps or for students of a particular race, color, national 
origin, or sex. In the event an employer or prospective employer is or 
has been subject to court action involving discrimination in employment, 
school officials should rely on the court's findings if the decision 
resolves the issue of whether the employer has engaged in unlawful 
discrimination.

                     b. apprentice training programs

    A recipient may not enter into any agreement for the provision or 
support of apprentice training for students or union members with any 
labor union or other sponsor that discriminates against its members or 
applicants for membership on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
sex, or handicap. If a recipient enters into a written agreement with a 
labor union or other sponsor providing for apprentice training, the 
agreement must contain an assurance from the union or other sponsor: (1) 
That it does not

[[Page 311]]

engage in such discrimination against its membership or applicants for 
membership; and (2) that apprentice training will be offered and 
conducted for its membership free of such discrimination.

                  VIII. Employment of Faculty and Staff

                         a. employment generally

    Recipients may not engage in any employment practice that 
discriminates against any employee or applicant for employment on the 
basis of sex or handicap. Recipients may not engage in any employment 
practice that discriminates on the basis of race, color, or national 
origin if such discrimination tends to result in segregation, exclusion 
or other discrimination against students.

                             b. recruitment

    Recipients may not limit their recruitment for employees to schools, 
communities, or companies disproportionately composed of persons of a 
particular race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap except for the 
purpose of overcoming the effects of past discrimination. Every source 
of faculty must be notified that the recipient does not discriminate in 
employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or 
handicap.

                      c. patterns of discrimination

    Whenever the Office for Civil Rights finds that in light of the 
representation of protected groups in the relevant labor market there is 
a significant underrepresentation or overrepresentation of protected 
group persons on the staff of a vocational education school or program, 
it will presume that the disproportion results from unlawful 
discrimination. This presumption can be overcome by proof that qualified 
persons of the particular race, color, national origin, or sex, or that 
qualified handicapped persons are not in fact available in the relevant 
labor market.

                           d. salary policies

    Recipients must establish and maintain faculty salary scales and 
policy based upon the conditions and responsibilities of employment, 
without regard to race, color, national origin, sex or handicap.

         e. employment opportunities for handicapped applicants

    Recipients must provide equal employment opportunities for teaching 
and administrative positions to handicapped applicants who can perform 
the essential functions of the position in question. Recipients must 
make reasonable accommodation for the physical or mental limitations of 
handicapped applicants who are otherwise qualified unless recipients can 
demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.

                  f. the effects of past discrimination

    Recipients must take steps to overcome the effects of past 
discrimination in the recruitment, hiring, and assignment of faculty. 
Such steps may include the recruitment or reassignment of qualified 
persons of a particular race, national origin, or sex, or who are 
handicapped.

       g. staff of state advisory councils of vocational education

    State Advisory Councils of Vocational Education are recipients of 
Federal financial assistance and therefore must comply with Section VIII 
of the Guidelines.

  h. employment at state operated vocational education centers through 
                     state civil-service authorities

    Where recruitment and hiring of staff for State operated vocational 
education centers is conducted by a State civil service employment 
authority, the State education agency operating the program must insure 
that recruitment and hiring of staff for the vocational education center 
is conducted in accordance with the requirements of these Guidelines.

              IX. Proprietary Vocational Education Schools

                      a. recipient responsibilities

    Proprietary vocational education schools that are recipients of 
Federal financial assistance through Federal student assistance programs 
or otherwise are subject to all of the requirements of the Department's 
regulations and these Guidelines.

                        b. enforcement authority

    Enforcement of the provisions of Title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is 
the responsibility of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
However, authority to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
for proprietary vocational education schools has been delegated to the 
Veterans Administration.
    When the Office for Civil Rights receives a Title VI complaint 
alleging discrimination by a proprietary vocational education school it 
will forward the complaint to the Veterans Administration and cite the 
applicable requirements of the Department's regulations and these 
Guidelines. The complainant will be notified of such action.

    Upon notice to all parties, the reviewing authority or the presiding 
officer, with respect to matters pending before them, may modify or

unduly prejudiced and the ends of justice will thereby be served.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Appearance and Practice


<R05>
Sec. 81.11  Appearance.

    A party may appear in person or by counsel and participate fully in 
any proceeding. A State agency or a corporation may appear by any of its 
officers or by any employee it authorizes to appear on its behalf. 
Counsel must be members in good standing of the bar of a State, 
Territory, or possession of the United States or of the District of 
Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


<R05>
Sec. 81.12  Authority for representation.

    Any individual acting in a representative capacity in any proceeding 
may be required to show his authority to act in such capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 81.13  Exclusion from hearing for misconduct.

    Disrespectful, disorderly, or contumacious language or contemptuous 
conduct, refusal to comply with directions, or continued use of dilatory 
tactics by any person at any hearing before a presiding officer shall 
constitute grounds for immediate exclusion of such person from the 
hearing by the presiding officer.


<R04>
                           Subpart C--Parties


<R05>

Services shall be deemed a party to all proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 81.22  Amici curiae.

    (a) Any interested person or organization may file a petition to 
participate in a proceeding as an amicus curiae. Such petition shall be 
filed prior to the prehearing conference, or if none is held, before the 
commencement of the hearing, unless the petitioner shows good cause for 
filing the petition later. The presiding officer may grant the petition 
if he finds that the petitioner has a legitimate interest in the 
proceedings, that such participation will not unduly delay the outcome, 
and may contribute materially to the proper disposition thereof. An 
amicus curiae is not a party and may not introduce evidence at a 
hearing.
    (b) An amicus curiae may submit a statement of position to the 
presiding officer prior to the beginning of a hearing, and shall serve a 
copy on each party. The amicus curiae may submit a brief on each 
occasion a decision is to be made or a prior decision is subject to 
review. His brief shall be filed and served on each party within the 
time limits applicable to the party whose position he deems himself to 
support; or if he does not deem himself to support the position of any 
party, within the longest time limit applicable to

[[Page 314]]

any party at that particular stage of the proceedings.
    (c) When all parties have completed their initial examination of a 
witness, any amicus curiae may request the presiding officer to propound 
specific questions to the witness. The presiding officer, in his 
discretion, may grant any such request if he believes the proposed 
additional testimony may assist materially in elucidating factual 
matters at issue between the parties and will not expand the issues.


<R05>
Sec. 81.23  Complainants not parties.

    A person submitting a complaint pursuant to Sec. 80.7(b) of this 
title is not a party to the proceedings governed by this part, but may

best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to 
support it, and that it is not interposed for delay. If a document is 
not signed or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this

    Service shall be made by personal delivery of one copy to each 
person to be served or by mailing by first-class mail, properly 
addressed with postage prepaid. When a party or amicus has appeared by 
attorney or other representative, service upon such attorney or 
representative will be deemed service upon the party or amicus. 
Documents served by mail preferably should be mailed in sufficient time 
to reach the addressee by the date on which the original is due to be 
filed, and should be air mailed if the addressee is more than 300 miles 
distant.

                             Subpart E--Time


<R05>
Sec. 81.41  Computation.

    In computing any period of time under the rules in this part or in 
an order issued hereunder, the time begins with the day following the

When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, 
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded 
from the computation.


<R05>
Sec. 81.42  Extension of time or postponement.

    Requests for extension of time should be served on all parties and 
should set forth the reasons for the application. Applications may be 
granted upon a showing of good cause by the applicant. From the 
designation of a presiding officer until the issuance of his decision 
such requests should be addressed to him. Answers to such requests are 
permitted, if made promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 81.43  Reduction of time to file documents.

    For good cause, the reviewing authority or the presiding officer, 
with respect to matters pending before them, may reduce any time limit

<R04>
                 Subpart F--Proceedings Prior to Hearing

to Sec. 80.9 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 81.52  Answer to notice.

    The respondent, applicant or recipient may file an answer to the 
notice within 20 days after service thereof. Answers shall admit or deny 
specifically and in detail each allegation of the notice, unless the 
respondent party is without knowledge, in which case his answer should 
so state, and the statement will be deemed a denial. Allegations of fact 
in the notice not denied or controverted by answer shall be deemed 
admitted. Matters alleged as affirmative defenses shall be separately 
stated and numbered. Failure of the respondent to file an answer within 
the 20-day period following service of the notice may be deemed an 
admission of all matters of fact recited in the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 81.53  Amendment of notice or answer.

    The General Counsel may amend the notice of hearing or opportunity 
for hearing once as a matter of course before an answer thereto is 
served, and each respondent may amend his answer once as a matter of 
course not later than 10 days before the date fixed for hearing but in 
no event later than 20 days from the date of service of his original 
answer. Otherwise a notice or answer may be amended only by leave of the 
presiding officer. A respondent shall file his answer to an amended 
notice within the time remaining for filing the answer to the original 
notice or within 10 days after service of the amended notice, whichever 
period may be the longer, unless the presiding officer otherwise orders.


<R05>
Sec. 81.54  Request for hearing.

    Within 20 days after service of a notice of opportunity for hearing 
which does not fix a date for hearing the respondent, either in his 
answer or in a separate document, may request a hearing. Failure of the 
respondent to request a hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to 
a hearing and to constitute his consent to the making of a decision on 
the basis of such information as is available.


<R05>
Sec. 81.55  Consolidation.

    The responsible Department official may provide for proceedings in 
the Department to be joined or consolidated for hearing with proceedings

proceeding consolidated subsequently to service of the notice of hearing 
or opportunity for hearing shall be promptly served with notice of such 
consolidation.


<R05>
Sec. 81.56  Motions.

    Motions and petitions shall state the relief sought, the authority 
relied upon, and the facts alleged. If made before or after the hearing, 
these matters shall be in writing. If made at the hearing, they may be 
stated orally; but the presiding officer may require that they be 
reduced to writing and filed and served on all parties in the same 
manner as a formal motion. Motions, answers, and replies shall be 
addressed to the presiding officer, if the case is pending before him. A 
repetitious motion will not be entertained.


<R05>
Sec. 81.57  Responses to motions and petitions.

    Within 8 days after a written motion or petition is served, or such 
other period as the reviewing authority or the presiding officer may 
fix, any party may file a response thereto. An immediate oral response 
may be made to an oral motion.


<R05>
Sec. 81.58  Disposition of motions and petitions.

    The reviewing authority or the presiding officer may not sustain or 
grant a written motion or petition prior to expiration of the time for 
filing responses thereto, but may overrule or deny such motion or 
petition without awaiting response: Provided, however, That prehearing 
conferences, hearings and decisions need not be delayed pending 
disposition of motions or petitions. Oral motions and petitions may be 
ruled on immediately. Motions and petitions submitted to the reviewing 
authority or the presiding officer, respectively, and not disposed of in 
separate rulings or in their respective decisions will be deemed denied. 
Oral arguments shall not be held or written motions or petitions unless 
the presiding officer in his discretion expressly so orders.


<R04>
       Subpart G--Responsibilities and Duties of Presiding Officer


<R05>
Sec. 81.61  Who presides.

    A hearing examiner assigned under 5 U.S.C. 3105 or 3344 (formerly

taking of evidence in any hearing to which these rules of procedure 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 81.62  Designation of hearing examiner.

    The designation of the hearing examiner as presiding officer shall 
be in writing, and shall specify whether the examiner is to make an 
initial decision or to certify the entire record including his 
recommended findings and proposed decision to the reviewing authority, 
and may also fix the time and place of hearing. A copy of such order 
shall be served on all parties. After service of an order designating a 
hearing examiner to preside, and until such examiner makes his decision, 
motions and petitions shall be submitted to him. In the case of the 
death, illness, disqualification or unavailability of the designated 
hearing examiner, another hearing examiner may be designated to take his 
place.


<R05>
Sec. 81.63  Authority of presiding officer.

    The presiding officer shall have the duty to conduct a fair hearing, 
to take all necessary action to avoid delay, and to maintain order. He 
shall have all powers necessary to these ends, including (but not 
limited to) the power to:
    (a) Arrange and issue notice of the date, time, and place of 
hearings, or, upon due notice to the parties, to change the date, time, 
and place of hearings previously set.
    (b) Hold conferences to settle, simplify, or fix the issues in a 
proceeding, or to consider other matters that may aid in the expeditious

respect to the various issues in the proceeding.
    (d) Administer oaths and affirmations.

<R04>
                      Subpart H--Hearing Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 81.71  Statement of position and trial briefs.

    The presiding officer may require parties and amici curiae to file 
written statements of position prior to the beginning of a hearing. The 
presiding officer may also require the parties to submit trial briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 81.72  Evidentiary purpose.

    (a) The hearing is directed to receiving factual evidence and expert 
opinion testimony related to the issues in the proceeding. Argument will 
not be received in evidence; rather it should be presented in 
statements, memoranda, or briefs, as determined by the presiding 
officer. Brief opening statements, which shall be limited to statement 
of the party's position and what he intends to prove, may be made at 
hearings.
    (b) Hearings for the reception of evidence will be held only in 
cases where issues of fact must be resolved in order to determine 
whether the respondent has failed to comply with one or more applicable 
requirements of Part 80 of this title. In any case where it appears from 
the respondent's answer to the notice of hearing or opportunity for 
hearing, from his failure timely to answer, or from his admissions or 
stipulations in the record, that there are no matters of material fact 
in dispute, the reviewing authority or presiding officer may enter an 
order so finding, vacating the hearing date if one has been set, and 
fixing the time for filing briefs under Sec. 81.101. Thereafter the 
proceedings shall go to conclusion in accordance with Subpart J of this 
part. The presiding officer may allow an appeal from such order in 
accordance with Sec. 81.86.


<R05>
Sec. 81.73  Testimony.

    Testimony shall be given orally under oath or affirmation by 
witnesses at the hearing; but the presiding officer, in his discretion, 
may require or permit that the direct testimony of any witness be 
prepared in writing and served on all parties in advance of the hearing. 
Such testimony may be adopted by the witness at the hearing, and filed 
as part of the record thereof. Unless authorized by the presiding 
officer, witnesses will not be permitted to read prepared testimony into 
the record. Except as provided in Sec.Sec. 81.75 and 81.76, witnesses 
shall be available at the hearing for cross-examination.


<R05>
Sec. 81.74  Exhibits.

    Proposed exhibits shall be exchanged at the prehearing conference, 
or otherwise prior to the hearing if the presiding officer so requires. 
Proposed exhibits not so exchanged may be denied admission as evidence. 
The authenticity of all proposed exhibits exchanged prior to hearing 
will be deemed admitted unless written objection thereto is filed prior 
to the hearing or unless good cause is shown at the hearing for failure 
to file such written objection.


<R05>
Sec. 81.75  Affidavits.

    An affidavit is; not inadmissible as such. Unless the presiding 
officer fixes other time periods affidavits shall be filed and served on 
the parties not later than 15 days prior to the hearing; and not less 
than 7 days prior to hearing a party may file and serve written 
objection to any affidavit on the ground that he believes it necessary 
to test the truth of assertions therein at hearing. In such event the 
assertions objected to will not be received in evidence unless the 
affiant is made available for cross-examination, or the presiding 
officer determines that cross-examination is not necessary for the full 
and true disclosure of facts referred to in such assertions. 
Notwithstanding any objection, however, affidavits may be

[[Page 318]]

considered in the case of any respondent who waives a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 81.76  Depositions.

    Upon such terms as may be just, for the convenience of the parties 
or of the Department, the presiding officer may authorize or direct the 
testimony of any witness to be taken by deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 81.77  Admissions as to facts and documents.

    Not later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing 
except for good cause shown, or prior to such earlier date as the 
presiding officer may order, any party may serve upon an opposing party 
a written request for the admission of the genuineness and authenticity 
of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request, 
or for the admission of the truth of any relevant matters of fact stated 
in the request. Each of the matters of which an admission is requested 
shall be deemed admitted, unless within a period designated in the 
request (not less than 10 days after service thereof, or within such 
further time as the presiding officer or the reviewing authority if no 
presiding officer has yet been designated may allow upon motion and 
notice) the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the 
requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the 
matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail 
the reasons why he cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters. 
Copies of requests for admission and answers thereto shall be served on 
all parties. Any admission made by a party to such request is only for 
the purposes of the pending proceeding, or any proceeding or action 
instituted for the enforcement of any order entered therein, and shall 
not constitute and admission by him for any other purpose or be used 
against him in any other proceeding or action.


<R05>
Sec. 81.78  Evidence.

    Irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, and unduly repetitious evidence 
will be excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 81.79  Cross-examination.

    A witness may be cross-examined on any matter material to the 
proceeding without regard to the scope of his direct examination.


<R05>
Sec. 81.80  Unsponsored written material.

    Letters expressing views or urging action and other unsponsored 
written material regarding matters in issue in a hearing will be placed 
in the correspondence section of the docket of the proceeding. These 
data are not deemed part of the evidence or record in the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 81.81  Objections.

    Objections to evidence shall be timely and briefly state the ground 
relied upon.


<R05>
Sec. 81.82  Exceptions to rulings of presiding officer unnecessary.

    Exceptions to rulings of the presiding officer are unnecessary. It 
is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the presiding 
officer is sought, makes known the action which he desires the presiding 
officer to take, or his objection to an action taken, and his grounds 
therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 81.83  Official notice.

    Where official notice is taken or is to be taken of a material fact 
not appearing in the evidence of record, any party, on timely request, 
shall be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 81.84  Public document items.

    Whenever there is offered (in whole or in part) a public document, 
such as an official report, decision, opinion, or published scientific 
or economic statistical data issued by any of the executive departments 
(or their subdivisions), legislative agencies or committees, or 
administrative agencies of the Federal Government (including Government-
owned corporations), or a similar document issued by a State or its 
agencies, and such document (or part thereof) has been shown by the 
offeror to be reasonably available to the public, such document need not 
be produced or marked for identification, but may be offered for 
official notice, as a

[[Page 319]]

public document item by specifying the document or relevant part 
thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 81.85  Offer of proof.

    An offer of proof made in connection with an objection taken to any 
ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral 
testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence 
which counsel contends would be adduced by such testimony; and, if the 
excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or written form or 
of reference to documents or records, a copy of such evidence shall be 
marked for identification and shall accompany the record as the offer of 
proof.


<R05>
Sec. 81.86  Appeals from ruling of presiding officer.

    Rulings of the presiding officer may not be appealed to the 
reviewing authority prior to his consideration of the entire proceeding 
except with the consent of the presiding officer and where he certifies 
on the record or in writing that the allowance of an interlocutory 
appeal is clearly necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or 
prejudice to any party, or substantial detriment to the public interest. 
If an appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the reviewing 
authority within such period as the presiding officer directs. No oral 
argument will be heard unless the reviewing authority directs otherwise. 
At any time prior to submission of the proceeding to it for decisions, 
the reviewing authority may direct the presiding officer to certify any 
question or the entire record to it for decision. Where the entire 
record is so certified, the presiding officer shall recommend a 
decision.


<R04>

<R05>
Sec. 81.91  Official transcript.

    The Department will designate the official reporter for all 
hearings. The official transcripts of testimony taken, together with any 
exhibits, briefs, or memoranda of law filed therewith shall be filed 
with the Department. Transcripts of testimony in hearings may be 
obtained from the official reporter by the parties and the public at 
rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by the contract between the 
Department and the reporter. Upon notice to all parties, the presiding 
officer may authorize corrections to the transcript which involve 
matters of substance.


<R05>
Sec. 81.92  Record for decision.

    The transcript of testimony, exhibits, and all papers and requests 
filed in the proceedings, except the correspondence section of the 
docket, including rulings and any recommended or initial decision shall 
constitute the exclusive record for decision.


<R04>
              Subpart J--Posthearing Procedures, Decisions


<R05>
Sec. 81.101  Posthearing briefs: Proposed findings and conclusions.

    (a) The presiding officer shall fix the time for filing posthearing 
briefs, which may contain proposed findings of fact and conclusions of 
law, and, if permitted, reply briefs.
    (b) Briefs should include a summary of the evidence relied upon 
together with references to exhibit numbers and pages of the transcript, 
with citations of the authorities relied upon.


<R05>
Sec. 81.102  Decisions following hearing.

    When the time for submission of posthearing briefs has expired, the 
presiding officer shall certify the entire record, including his 
recommended findings and proposed decision, to the responsible 
Department official; or if so authorized he shall make an initial 
decision. A copy of the recommended findings and proposed decision, or 
of the initial decision, shall be served upon all parties, and amici, if 
any.


<R05>
Sec. 81.103  Exceptions to initial or recommended decisions.

    Within 20 days after the mailing of an initial or recommended 
decision, any party may file exceptions to the decision, stating reasons 
therefor, with the reviewing authority. Any other party may file a 
response thereto within 30 days after the mailing of the decision. Upon 
the filing of such exceptions, the reviewing authority shall review the 
decision and issue its own decision thereon.

[[Page 320]]


<R05>
Sec. 81.104  Final decisions.

    (a) Where the hearing is conducted by a hearing examiner who makes 
an initial decision, if no exceptions thereto are filed within the 20-
day period specified in Sec. 81.103, such decision shall become the 
final decision of the Department, and shall constitute ``final agency 
action'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 (formerly section 10(c) of 
the Administrative Procedure Act), subject to the provisions of Sec. 
81.106.
    (b) Where the hearing is conducted by a hearing examiner who makes a 
recommended decision, or upon the filing of exceptions to a hearing 
examiner's initial decision, the reviewing authority shall review the 
recommended or initial decision and shall issue its own decision 
thereon, which shall become the final decision of the Department, and 
shall constitute ``final agency action'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 
704 (formerly section 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act), 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 81.106.
    (c) All final decisions shall be promptly served on all parties, and 
amici, if any.


<R05>
Sec. 81.105  Oral argument to the reviewing authority.

    (a) If any party desires to argue a case orally on exceptions or 
replies to exceptions to an initial or recommended decision, he shall 
make such request in writing. The reviewing authority may grant or deny 
such requests in its discretion. If granted, it will serve notice of 
oral argument on all parties. The notice will set forth the order of 
presentation, the amount of time allotted, and the time and place for 
argument. The names of persons who will argue should be filed with the 
Department hearing clerk not later than 7 days before the date set for 
oral argument.
    (b) The purpose of oral argument is to emphasize and clarify the 
written argument in the briefs. Reading at length from the brief or 
other texts is not favored. Participants should confine their arguments 
to points of controlling importance and to points upon which exceptions 
have been filed. Consolidations of appearances at oral argument by 
parties taking the same side will permit the parties' interests to be 
presented more effectively in the time allotted.
    (c) Pamphlets, charts, and other written material may be presented 
at oral argument only if such material is limited to facts already in 
the record and is served on all parties and filed with the Department 
hearing clerk at least 7 days before the argument.


<R05>
Sec. 81.106  Review by the Secretary.

    Within 20 days after an initial decision becomes a final decision 
pursuant to Sec. 81.104(a) or within 20 days of the mailing of a final 
decision referred to in Sec. 81.104(b), as the case may be, a party may 
request the Secretary to review the final decision. The Secretary may 
grant or deny such request, in whole or in part, or serve notice of his 
intent to review the decision in whole or in part upon his own motion. 
If the Secretary grants the requested review, or if he serves notice of 
intent to review upon his own motion, each party to the decision shall 
have 20 days following notice of the Secretary's proposed action within 
which to file exceptions to the decision and supporting briefs and 
memoranda, or briefs and memoranda in support of the decision. Failure 
of a party to request review under this paragraph shall not be deemed a 
failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining 
judicial review.

                Subpart K--Judicial Standards of Practice


<R05>
Sec. 81.111  Conduct.

    Parties and their representatives are expected to conduct themselves 
with honor and dignity and observe judicial standards of practice and 
ethics in all proceedings. They should not indulge in offensive 
personalities, unseemly wrangling, or intemperate accusations

[[Page 321]]

or characterizations. A representative of any party whether or not a 
lawyer shall observe the traditional responsibilities of lawyers as 
officers of the court and use his best efforts to restrain his client 
from improprieties in connection with a proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 81.112  Improper conduct.

    With respect to any proceeding it is improper for any interested 
person to attempt to sway the judgment of the reviewing authority by 
undertaking to bring pressure or influence to bear upon any officer 
having a responsibility for a decision in the proceeding, or his 
decisional staff. It is improper that such interested persons or any 
members of the Department's staff or the presiding officer give 
statements to communications media, by paid advertisement or otherwise, 
designed to influence the judgment of any officer having a 
responsibility for a decision in the proceeding, or his decisional 
staff. It is improper for any person to solicit communications to any 
such officer, or his decisional staff, other than proper communications 
by parties or amici curiae.


<R05>
Sec. 81.113  Ex parte communications.

    Only persons employed by or assigned to work with the reviewing 
authority who perform no investigative or prosecuting function in 
connection with a proceeding shall communicate ex parte with the 
reviewing authority, or the presiding officer, or any employee or person 
involved in the decisional process in such proceedings with respect to 
the merits of that or a factually related proceeding. The reviewing 
authority, the presiding officer, or any employee or person involved in 
the decisional process of a proceeding shall communicate ex parte with 
respect to the merits of that or a factually related proceeding only 
with persons employed by or assigned to work with them and who perform 
no investigative or prosecuting function in connection with the 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 81.114  Expeditious treatment.

    Requests for expeditious treatment of matters pending before the 
responsible Department official or the presiding officer are deemed 
communications on the merits, and are improper except when forwarded 
from parties to a proceeding and served upon all other parties thereto. 
Such communications should be in the form of a motion.


<R05>
Sec. 81.115  Matters not prohibited.

    A request for information which merely inquires about the status of 
a proceeding without discussing issues or expressing points of view is 
not deemed an ex parte communication. Such requests should be directed 
to the Civil Rights hearing clerk. Communications with respect to minor 
procedural matters or inquiries or emergency requests for extensions of 
time are not deemed ex parte communications prohibited by Sec. 81.113. 
Where feasible, however, such communications should be by letter with 
copies to all parties. Ex parte communications between a respondent and 
the responsible Department official or the Secretary with respect to 
securing such respondent's voluntary compliance with any requirement of 
part 80 of this title are not prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 81.116  Filing of ex parte communications.

    A prohibited communication in writing received by the Secretary, the 
reviewing authority, or by the presiding officer, shall be made public 
by placing it in the correspondence file of the docket in the case and 
will not be considered as part of the record for decision. If the 
prohibited communication is received orally a memorandum setting forth 
its substance shall be made and filed in the correspondence section of 
the docket in the case. A person referred to in such memorandum may file 
a comment for inclusion in the docket if he considers the memorandum to 
be incorrect.

<R05>
Sec. 81.121  Posttermination proceedings.

terminating, discontinuing, or refusing Federal financial assistance in 
consequence of proceedings pursuant to this title may request the 
responsible

[[Page 322]]

Department official for an order authorizing payment, or permitting 
resumption, of Federal financial assistance. Such request shall be in 
writing and shall affirmatively show that since entry of the order, it 
has brought its program or activity into compliance with the 
requirements of the Act, and with the Regulation thereunder, and shall 
set forth specifically, and in detail, the steps which it has taken to 
achieve such compliance. If the responsible Department official denies 
such request the applicant or recipient shall be given an expeditious 
hearing if it so requests in writing and specifies why it believes the 
responsible Department official to have been in error. The request for 
such a hearing shall be addressed to the responsible Department official 
and shall be made within 30 days after the applicant or recipient is 
informed that the responsible Department official has refused to 
authorize payment or permit resumption of Federal financial assistance.
    (b) In the event that a hearing shall be requested pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, the hearing procedures established by

               Subpart A--Purposes; Definitions; Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 83.1  Purposes.

    (a) The purposes of this part are (1) to effectuate the provisions 
of sections 799A and 845 of the Public Health Service Act, which forbid

of sex in the admission of individuals to its training programs, and (2) 
to implement the policy of the Secretary that no Federal support will be 
extended under those titles to any other entity

[[Page 323]]

unless that entity submits to the Secretary an assurance satisfactory to 
the Secretary that it will not discriminate on the basis of sex in the 
admission of individuals to its training programs.
    (b) The objective of this part is to abolish use of sex as a 
criterion in the admission of individuals to all training programs 
operated by an entity which receives support under title VII or VIII of 
the Act, and thereby to foster maximum use of all available human 
resources in meeting the Nation's needs for qualified health personnel.

the Act, and a program leading to any license or certification requisite 
to the practice of a health profession for which a degree specified in

<R05>
Sec. 83.3  Remedial and affirmative actions.

    (a) Remedial action. If the Director finds that an entity has 
discriminated against persons on the basis of sex in any of its training 
programs, such entity shall take such remedial action as the Director 
deems necessary to overcome the effects of such discrimination.
    (b) Affirmative action. In the absence of a finding of 
discrimination on the basis of sex in a training program, an entity may 
take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which 
resulted in limited participation therein by persons of a particular 
sex.


<R05>
Sec. 83.4  Coverage.

    (a) If an entity receives Federal support for any of its training 
programs, all of its training programs thereby become subject to this 
part.
    (b) The obligation imposed by this part on a federally supported 
entity not to discriminate on the basis of sex in the admission of 
individuals to a training program includes not only the

[[Page 324]]

obligation not to discriminate on such basis in the selection of 
individuals for such program, but also the obligation not to 
discriminate on such basis against individuals after their selection for 
such program.
    (c) The obligation imposed by this part on a federally supported 
entity not to discriminate on the basis of sex against an individual who 
is an applicant for, or is enrolled in, a training program is applicable 
to the same extent to the actions of such entity with respect to an 
applicant for, or a student enrolled in, an undergraduate program of 
education of such entity if individuals enrolled in such program must 
complete all or a part of such programs to be eligible for admission to 
an undergraduate training program of such entity.
    (d) An entity shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in 
violation of this part for as long as such entity receives or benefits 
from Federal support. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an entity 
shall be deemed to continue to receive or benefit from Federal support 
for as long as it retains ownership, possession, or use of either real 
or personal property and which was acquired in whole or in part with 
Federal support. If an entity receives value for property which was 
acquired in whole or in part with Federal support and such value is 
applied toward the acquisition of other property, such entity shall be 
deemed to continue to receive or benefit from such support for as long 
as such entity retains ownership, use, or possession of such other 
property.
    (e) An entity shall not transfer property which was acquired, 
constructed, altered, repaired, expanded, or renovated in whole or in 
part with Federal support unless the agency, organization, or individual 
to whom such property is to be transferred has submitted to the 
Director, and he or she has found satisfactory, an assurance of 
compliance with this part. The preceding sentence shall not apply with 
respect to any real or personal property for which payments have been 
recaptured by the United States under title VII or VIII of the Act, with 
respect to any other property for which the transferring entity has 
refunded to the Federal Government the Federal share of the fair market 
value of such property, or with respect to any personal property which 
has only scrap value to both the entity and the agency, organization or 
individual to which the property is to be transferred.


<R05>
Sec. 83.5  Effect of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

    The obligations imposed by this part are independent of obligations 
imposed by or pursuant to title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.


<R05>
Sec.Sec. 83.6-83.9  [Reserved]


<R04>
           Subpart B--Discrimination in Admissions Prohibited


<R05>
Sec. 83.10  General obligations.

    (a) Eligibility for support. No entity will be provided Federal 
support unless such entity has furnished the Director assurances 
satisfactory to him or her that it will not discriminate on the basis of 
sex, in violation of this part, in the admission of individuals to each 
of its training programs.
    (b) Eliminating the effects of discrimination. An assurance of 
compliance with this part will not be satisfactory to the Director if 
the entity submitting such assurance fails to take whatever remedial 
action in accordance with Sec. 83.3(a) that is necessary for such entity 
to eliminate the effects of any discrimination on the basis of sex in 
the admission of individuals to its training programs that such entity 
practiced prior to the submission to the Director of such assurance, or 
practices at the time of or subsequent to such submission. The Director 
may require such entity, as a condition to determining that its 
assurance is, or remains, satisfactory, to take specific actions, or to 
submit to him or her specific information, bearing upon compliance with 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 83.11  Discriminatory acts prohibited.

    (a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, 
occupational training, or other training program or activity operated by 
an entity.

[[Page 325]]

    (b) Discrimination in selection. In determining whether an 
individual satisfies any enrollment, eligibility, or other condition for 
selection for a training program, a federally supported entity shall 
not:
    (1) On the basis of sex, given preference to one individual over 
another by ranking applicants on such basis, or otherwise give such 
preference; or
    (2) Apply numerical limitations upon the number or proportion of 
persons of either sex who may be admitted; or
    (3) Otherwise treat one individual differently from another on the 
basis of sex.
    (c) Testing. A federally supported entity shall not administer or 
operate any test or use any criterion for admission which has a 
disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless 
the use of such test or criterion is shown validly to predict success in 
the training program or activity in question and alternative tests or 
criteria which do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are 
shown to be unavailable.
    (d) Prohibitions relating to marital or parental status. In 
determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for 
admission, or in making any offer of admission, in providing financial 
aid or any other benefit, an entity to which this subpart applies:
    (1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential 
parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant which 
treats persons differently on the basis of sex;
    (2) Shall not discriminate against or exclude any person on the 
basis of pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy or recovery 
therefrom, or establish or follow any rule or practice which so 
discriminates or excludes;
    (3) Shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy and 
any temporary disabilities related to or resulting from pregnancy, 
childbirth, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom in the same 
manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability or 
physical condition; and
    (4) Shall not make pre-admission inquiry as to the marital status of 
an applicant for admission, including whether such applicant is 
``Miss,'' or ``Mrs.'' A recipient may make pre-admission inquiry as to 
the sex of an applicant for admission, but only if such inquiry is made 
equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such 
inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by 
this part.
    (e) Preference to students from other institutions in admission. An 
entity shall not give preference to applicants for admission, on the 
basis of attendance at any educational institution or other school or 
entity which admits as students only or predominantly members of one 
sex, if the giving of such preference has the effect of discriminating 
on the basis of sex in violation of this part.
    (f) Discrimination in the provision of benefits and services--(1) 
General. Except as otherwise provided in this part in providing 
financial aid or any other benefit, or in providing any service, to an 
applicant for a training program or to a student enrolled in such 
program, no federally supported entity shall on the basis of sex:
    (i) Treat one individual differently from another in determining 
whether such individual satisfies any requirement or condition for the 
provision of such benefit of service;
    (ii) Provide a different benefit or service or provide a benefit or 
a service in a different manner;
    (iii) Deny an individual any such benefit or service;
    (iv) Subject an individual to separate treatment or rules of 
behavior;
    (v) Discriminate against any individual by assisting an agency, 
organization, or individual in providing, in a manner which 
discriminates on the basis of sex, a benefit or service to applicants 
for or students enrolled in a training program; or
    (vi) Otherwise limit any individual in the enjoyment of any right, 
privilege, advantage, or opportunity.
    (2) Financial aid established by certain legal instruments. (i) A 
recipient may administer or assist in the administration of 
scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance 
established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or 
similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government which 
requires that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified 
therein: Provided,

[[Page 326]]

That the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted 
scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does 
not discriminate on the basis of sex.
    (ii) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, recipients shall develop and use 
procedures under which:
    (A) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the 
basis of non-discriminatory criteria and not on the basis of 
availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
    (B) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other 
form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) (A) of this section; and
    (C) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected 
under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section because of the absence of 
a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance 
designated for a member of that student's sex.
    (g) Housing. (1) An entity shall not, on the basis of sex, apply 
different rules or regulations, impose different fees or requirements, 
or offer different services or benefits related to housing, except as 
provided in this subsection (including housing provided only to married 
students).
    (2) An entity may provide separate housing on the basis of sex.
    (3) Housing provided by an entity to students of one sex, when 
compared to that provided to students of the other sex, shall be as a 
whole: (i) Proportionate in quantity to the number of students of that 
sex applying for such housing; and (ii) comparable in quality and cost 
to the student.
    (4) An entity shall not on the basis of sex, administer different 
policies or practices concerning occupancy by its students of housing 
other than that provided by such recipient.
    (5) An entity which, through solicitation, listing, approval of 
housing, or otherwise, assists any agency, organization, or person in 
making housing available to any of its students, shall take reasonable 
action to ensure that such housing is provided to students of one sex, 
when compared to that provided to students of the other sex, is as a 
whole: (i) Proportionate in quantity and (ii) comparable in quality and 
cost to the student. An entity may render such assistance to any agency, 
organization, or person which provides all or part of such housing to 
students only of one sex.
    (h) Inter-institutional programs. If a federally supported entity 
aids participation, by any applicant for or student enrolled in any of 
its training programs, in any program or activity of another 
organization or agency, such entity shall:
    (1) Develop and implement a procedure to assure itself that such 
organization or agency takes no action with respect to such applicants 
or students which this part would prohibit such entity from taking; and
    (2) Not aid such participation if such organization or agency takes 
such action.
    (i) Discrimination in employment prohibited. A federally supported 
entity shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in employment 
practices relating to its professional and other staff who work directly 
with applicants for or students enrolled in any of its training 
programs. The provisions of this subpart apply to:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the process of application for 
employment;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, consideration for and award of 
tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from 
layoff, and rehiring;
    (3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation, and changes in 
compensation;
    (4) Job assignments, classifications and structure, including 
position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;
    (5) The terms of any collective bargaining agreement;
    (6) Granting and return from leaves of absence, pregnancy leave, 
leave for persons of either sex to care for children or dependents, or 
any other leave;
    (7) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or 
not administered by the recipient;

tuition assistance, selection for sabbaticals and leaves of absence to 
pursue training;
    (9) Employer-sponsored activities, including social or recreational 
programs; and
    (10) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.


<R05>
Sec. 83.12  Recruitment.

    (a) Comparable recruitment. A federally supported entity shall, with 
respect to each of its training programs, make comparable efforts to 
recruit members of each sex in the geographic area from which such 
entity attracts its students. A federally supported entity shall not 
recruit for any of its training programs exclusively or primarily at 
organizations or agencies which admit as members or students, or which 
provide a service for, only members of one sex unless such entity can 
demonstrate that such action is part of a recruitment program which does 
not have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in selection 
for a training program.
    (b) Recruitment practices. A federally supported entity shall:
    (1) Prominently include a statement of its policy of 
nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in each announcement, bulletin, 
catalogue, or application form which describes the training program of 
such entity or is used in connection with the recruitment of employees 
who will work directly with applicants for or students enrolled in a 
training program;
    (2) Distribute without discrimination on the basis of sex any 
announcements, bulletins, catalogues, or other materials used in 
connection with the recruitment of students for a training program or 
employees who will work directly with applicants for such program or 
such students; and
    (3) Apprise each of its recruitment representatives of its policy of 
nondiscrimination on the basis of sex, and require such representatives 
to adhere to such policy.


<R05>
Sec. 83.13  State law and licensure requirements.

    The obligation of an entity to comply with this part is not obviated 
or alleviated by any State or local law which would render an applicant 
for or student enrolled in a training program ineligible on the basis of 
sex for any license or certificate requisite to the practice of the 
health profession for which such applicant seeks, or student pursues, 
training.


<R05>
Sec. 83.14  Development and dissemination of nondiscrimination policy.

    (a) A federally supported entity shall develop a written policy 
statement of nondiscrimination on the basis of sex, in accordance with 
this part, and shall implement specific and continuing steps to 
publicize such statement to applicants for admission or employment, 
students, employees, and sources of referral of applicants for admission 
or employment.
    (b) Each federally supported entity shall prominently include a 
statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in 
each announcement, bulletin, catalogue, and application form which it 
makes available to any person of a type described in paragraph (a) of 
this section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the 
recruitment of students or employees who work directly with students and 
applicants for admission.
    (c) A federally supported entity shall not use or distribute a 
publication of the type described in this section which suggests, by 
text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students, 
or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is 
permitted by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 83.15  Designation by entity of responsible employee and adoption of 
grievance procedures.

    (a) Designation of responsible employee. A federally supported 
entity shall designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts 
to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under this part, 
including any investigation of any complaint communicated to such entity 
alleging its noncompliance with this part or alleging any action which 
would be prohibited by this part. The entity shall notify all of its 
students and employees who work directly with students and applicants 
for admission

[[Page 328]]

of the name, office address and telephone number of the employee or 
employees appointed pursuant to this paragraph.
    (b) Complaint procedure of entity. A federally supported entity 
shall adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for prompt and 
equitable resolution of student and employee complaints alleging any 
action which would be prohibited by this part. Such procedures shall be 
in writing and available to all present and prospective students and 
employees.

    (a) General. No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity which receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance.
    (b) Discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient, in providing 
any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, 
licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap:
    (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;

handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such 
action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, 
benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by 
others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.
    (2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be 
equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or 
level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but 
must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same 
result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of 
achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's 
needs.
    (3) Despite the existence of separate or different programs or 
activities provided in accordance with this part, a

[[Page 331]]

recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate in such programs or activities that are not separate or 
different.
    (4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) that 
have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the purpose or 
effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the 
objectives of the recipient's program with respect to handicapped 
persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another 
recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative 
control or are agencies of the same State.
    (5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant 
for assistance or a recipient may not make selections (i) that have the 
effect of excluding handicapped persons from, denying them the benefits 
of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or 
activity that receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance or 
(ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or 
activity with respect to handicapped persons.

leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with 
Federal financial assistance.
    (c) Programs limited by Federal law. The exclusion of nonhandicapped 
persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or 
executive order to handicapped persons or the exclusion of a specific 
class of handicapped persons from a program limited by Federal statute 
or executive order to a different class of handicapped persons is not 
prohibited by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 84.5  Assurances required.

    (a) Assurances. An applicant for Federal financial assistance for a 
program or activity to which this part applies shall submit an 
assurance, on a form specified by the Director, that the program will be 
operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate 
these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to the 
Department.
    (b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial 
assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real 
property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the 
recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for 
the period during which the real property or structures are used for the 
purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for 
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
    (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide 
personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the 
period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
    (3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for 
the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
    (c) Covenants. (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in 
the form of real property or interest in the property from the 
Department, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall 
contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for 
the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for 
which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another 
purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
    (2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is 
purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient 
shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent 
transfer of the property.
    (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of 
real property or interest in the property from the Department, the 
covenant shall also include a condition coupled

[[Page 332]]

with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the 
property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of 
real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real 
property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement 
of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the 
property was transferred, the Director may, upon request of the 
transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such 
conditions as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise 
of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage 
or other encumbrance remains effective.


<R05>
Sec. 84.6  Remedial action, voluntary action, and self-evaluation.

    (a) Remedial action. (1) If the Director finds that a recipient has 
discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of 
section 504 or this part, the recipient shall take such remedial action 
as the Director deems necessary to overcome the effects of the 
discrimination.
    (2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against persons 
on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part and 
where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has 
discriminated, the Director, where appropriate, may require either or 
both recipients to take remedial action.
    (3) The Director may, where necessary to overcome the effects of 
discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part, require a 
recipient to take remedial action (i) with respect to handicapped 
persons who are no longer participants in the recipient's program but 
who were participants in the program when such discrimination occurred 
or (ii) with respect to handicapped persons who would have been 
participants in the program had the discrimination not occurred.
    (b) Voluntary action. A recipient may take steps, in addition to any 
action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's 
program or activity by qualified handicapped persons.
    (c) Self-evaluation. (1) A recipient shall, within one year of the 
effective date of this part:
    (i) Evaluate, with the assistance of interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
its current policies and practices and the effects thereof that do not 
or may not meet the requirements of this part;
    (ii) Modify, after consultation with interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
any policies and practices that do not meet the requirements of this 
part; and
    (iii) Take, after consultation with interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any 
discrimination that resulted from adherence to these policies and 
practices.
    (2) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall, for at 
least three years following completion of the evaluation required under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, maintain on file, make available for 
public inspection, and provide to the Director upon request: (i) A list 
of the interested persons consulted (ii) a description of areas examined 
and any problems identified, and (iii) a description of any 
modifications made and of any remedial steps taken.


<R05>
Sec. 84.7  Designation of responsible employee and adoption of grievance 
procedures.

    (a) Designation of responsible employee. A recipient that employs 
fifteen or more persons shall designate at least one person to 
coordinate its efforts to comply with this part.
    (b) Adoption of grievance procedures. A recipient that employs 
fifteen or more persons shall adopt grievance procedures that 
incorporate appropriate due process standards and that provide for the 
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action 
prohibited by this part. Such procedures need not be established with 
respect to complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants 
for admission to postsecondary educational institutions.

[[Page 333]]


<R05>
Sec. 84.8  Notice.

    (a) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall take 
appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify participants, 
beneficiaries, applications, and employees, including those with 
impaired vision or hearing, and unions or professional organizations 
holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the 
recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in 
violation of section 504 and this part. The notification shall state, 
where appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate in admission 
or access to, or treatment or employment in, its programs and 
activities. The notification shall also include an identification of the 
responsible employee designated pursuant to Sec. 84.7(a). A recipient 
shall make the initial notification required by this paragraph within 90 
days of the effective date of this part. Methods of initial and 
continuing notification may include the posting of notices, publication 
in newspapers and magazines, placement of notices in recipients' 
publication, and distribution of memoranda or other written 
communications.
    (b) If a recipient publishes or uses recruitment materials or 
publications containing general information that it makes available to 
participants, beneficiaries, applicants, or employees, it shall include 
in those materials or publications a statement of the policy described 
in paragraph (a) of this section. A recipient may meet the requirement 
of this paragraph either by including appropriate inserts in existing 
materials and publications or by revising and reprinting the materials 
and publications.


<R05>
Sec. 84.9  Administrative requirements for small recipients.

    The Director may require any recipient with fewer than fifteen 
employees, or any class of such recipients, to comply with Sec.Sec. 84.7 
and 84.8, in whole or in part, when the Director finds a violation of 
this part or finds that such compliance will not significantly impair 
the ability of the recipient or class of recipients to provide benefits 
or services.


<R05>
Sec. 84.10  Effect of State or local law or other requirements and effect 
of employment opportunities.

    (a) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or 
alleviated by the existence of any state or local law or other 
requirement that, on the basis of handicap, imposes prohibitions or 
limits upon the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive 
services or to practice any occupation or profession.
    (b) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or 
alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or 
profession are or may be more limited for handicapped persons than for 
nonhandicapped persons.


<R04>
                     Subpart B--Employment Practices


<R05>
Sec. 84.11  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. (1) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis 
of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any 
program or activity to which this part applies.
    (2) A recipient that receives assistance under the Education of the 
Handicapped Act shall take positive steps to employ and advance in 
employment qualified handicapped persons in programs assisted under that 
Act.
    (3) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under 
any program or activity to which this part applies in a manner which 
ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur and 
may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way 
that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of 
handicap.
    (4) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other 
relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped 
applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. 
The relationships referred to in this paragraph include relationships 
with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, with 
organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of 
the recipient, and with organizations providing training and 
apprenticeship programs.

[[Page 334]]

    (b) Specific activities. The provisions of this subpart apply to:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for 
employment;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, 
transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff and rehiring;
    (3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in 
compensation;
    (4) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, 
position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;
    (5) Leaves of absense, sick leave, or any other leave;
    (6) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or 
not administered by the recipient;
    (7) Selection and financial support for training, including 
apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related 
activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;
    (8) Employer sponsored activities, including social or recreational 
programs; and
    (9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.
    (c) A recipient's obligation to comply with this subpart is not 
affected by any inconsistent term of any collective bargaining agreement 
to which it is a party.


<R05>
Sec. 84.12  Reasonable accommodation.

    (a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known 
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped 
applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its 
program.
    (b) Reasonable accommodation may include: (1) Making facilities used 
by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, 
and (2) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, 
acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of 
readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.
    (c) In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section whether 
an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a 
recipient's program, factors to be considered include:
    (1) The overall size of the recipient's program with respect to 
number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget;
    (2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition 
and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
    (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
    (d) A recipient may not deny any employment opportunity to a 
qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for the denial 
is the need to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental 
limitations of the employee or applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 84.13  Employment criteria.

    (a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other 
selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped 
persons or any class of handicapped persons unless: (1) The test score 
or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be 
job-related for the position in question, and (2) alternative job-
related tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out 
as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Director to be 
available.
    (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning 
employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant 
or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or 
employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test 
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or 
employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where 
those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).


<R05>
Sec. 84.14  Preemployment inquiries.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not 
make preemployment inquiry of an applicant

[[Page 335]]

as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature 
or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment 
inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.
    (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination pursuant to Sec. 84.6 (a), when a 
recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally 
assisted program or activity pursuant to Sec. 84.6(b), or when a 
recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the 
Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate 
whether and to what extent they are handicapped, Provided, That:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is 
used that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or 
affirmative action efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it 
will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and 
that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, 
Provided, That: (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an 
examination regardless of handicap, and (2) the results of such an 
examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this 
part.
    (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the 
medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and 
maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentiality as 
medical records, except that:
    (1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions 
on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary 
accommodations;
    (2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where 
appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and
    (3) Government officials investigating compliance with the Act shall 
be provided relevant information upon request.


<R05>
Sec.Sec. 84.15-84.20  [Reserved]


<R04>
                    Subpart C--Program Accessibility


<R05>
Sec. 84.21  Discrimination prohibited.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, because a recipient's 
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which 
this part applies.


<R05>
Sec. 84.22  Existing facilities.

    (a) Program accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or 
activity to which this part applies so that the program or activity, 
when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to handicapped 
persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its 
existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable 
by handicapped persons.
    (b) Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible 
buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery 
of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible 
sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new 
facilities in conformance with the requirements of Sec. 84.23, or any 
other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible 
to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing 
among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that

[[Page 336]]

offer programs and activities to handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Small health, welfare, or other social service providers. If a 
recipient with fewer than fifteen employees that provides health, 
welfare, or other social services finds, after consultation with a 
handicapped person seeking its services, that there is no method of 
complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a 
significant alteration in its existing facilities, the recipient may, as 
an alternative, refer the handicapped person to other providers of those 
services that are accessible.
    (d) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of 
this part except that where structural changes in facilities are 
necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the 
effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (e) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the 
effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps 
necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the 
assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or 
organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition 
plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a 
minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify the steps that will be taken 
during each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.
    (f) Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to 
ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision 
or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of 
services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usable 
by handicapped persons.

Sec. 84.23  New construction.

    (a) Design and construction. Each facility or part of a facility 
constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be 
designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, if 
the construction was commenced after the effective date of this part.
    (b) Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility which is altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date 
of this part in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of 
the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent 
feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (c) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of 
buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (UFSA) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with 
respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and 
scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted 
where substantial equivalent or greater access to and usability of the 
building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations

[[Page 337]]

that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or 
altering a load-bearing structural member.

<R04>
        Subpart D--Preschool, Elementary, and Secondary Education


<R05>
Sec. 84.31  Application of this subpart.

    Subpart D applies to preschool, elementary, secondary, and adult 
education programs and activities that receive or benefit from Federal 
financial assistance and to recipients that operate, or that receive or 
benefit from Federal financial assistance for the operation of, such 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 84.32  Location and notification.

    A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education 
program shall annually:
    (a) Undertake to identify and locate every qualified handicapped 
person residing in the recipient's jurisdiction who is not receiving a 
public education; and
    (b) Take appropriate steps to notify handicapped persons and their 
parents or guardians of the recipient's duty under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 84.33  Free appropriate public education.

    (a) General. A recipient that operates a public elementary or 
secondary education program shall provide a free appropriate public 
education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's 
jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's 
handicap.
    (b) Appropriate education. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the 
provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or 
special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to 
meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately 
as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon 
adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of Sec.Sec. 84.34, 
84.35, and 84.36.
    (2) Implementation of an individualized education program developed 
in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of 
meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (3) A recipient may place a handicapped person in or refer such 
person to a program other than the one that it operates as its means of 
carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient 
remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subpart 
are met with respect to any handicapped person so placed or referred.
    (c) Free education--(1) General. For the purpose of this section, 
the provision of a free education is the provision of educational and 
related services without cost to the handicapped person or to his or her 
parents or guardian, except for those fees that are imposed on non-
handicapped persons or their parents or guardian. It may consist either 
of the provision of free services or, if a recipient places a 
handicapped person in or refers such person to a program not operated by 
the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this 
subpart, of payment for the costs of the program. Funds available from 
any public or private agency may be used to meet the requirements of 
this subpart. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an 
insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to 
provide or pay for services provided to a handicapped person.
    (2) Transportation. If a recipient places a handicapped person in or 
refers such person to a program not operated by the recipient as its 
means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient 
shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from the program is 
provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the person or his 
or her parents or guardian if the person were placed in the program 
operated by the recipient.
    (3) Residential placement. If placement in a public or private 
residential program is necessary to provide a free appropriate public 
education to a handicapped person because of his or her handicap, the 
program, including non-medical care and room and board, shall be 
provided at no cost to the person or his or her parents or guardian.

[[Page 338]]

    (4) Placement of handicapped persons by parents. If a recipient has 
made available, in conformance with the requirements of this section and 
Sec. 84.34, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person 
and the person's parents or guardian choose to place the person in a 
private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's 
education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or 
guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made such a 
program available or otherwise regarding the question of financial 
responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of Sec. 84.36.
    (d) Compliance. A recipient may not exclude any qualified 
handicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education after 
the effective date of this part. A recipient that is not, on the 
effective date of this regulation, in full compliance with the other 
requirements of the preceding paragraphs of this section shall meet such 
requirements at the earliest practicable time and in no event later than 
September 1, 1978.


<R05>
Sec. 84.34  Educational setting.

    (a) Academic setting. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall educate, or shall provide for the education of, each qualified 
handicapped person in its jurisdiction with persons who are not 
handicapped to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the 
handicapped person. A recipient shall place a handicapped person in the 
regular educational environment operated by the recipient unless it is 
demonstrated by the recipient that the education of the person in the 
regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services 
cannot be achieved satisfactorily. Whenever a recipient places a person 
in a setting other than the regular educational environment pursuant to 
this paragraph, it shall take into account the proximity of the 
alternate setting to the person's home.
    (b) Nonacademic settings. In providing or arranging for the 
provision of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities, 
including meals, recess periods, and the services and activities set 
forth in Sec. 84.37(a)(2), a recipient shall ensure that handicapped 
persons participate with nonhandicapped persons in such activities and 
services to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the 
handicapped person in question.
    (c) Comparable facilities. If a recipient, in compliance with 
paragraph (a) of this section, operates a facility that is identifiable 
as being for handicapped persons, the recipient shall ensure that the 
facility and the services and activities provided therein are comparable 
to the other facilities, services, and activities of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 84.35  Evaluation and placement.

    (a) Preplacement evaluation. A recipient that operates a public 
elementary or secondary education program shall conduct an evaluation in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section of any 
person who, because of handicap, needs or is believed to need special 
education or related services before taking any action with respect to 
the initial placement of the person in a regular or special education 
program and any subsequent significant change in placement.
    (b) Evaluation procedures. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall establish standards and procedures for the evaluation and 
placement of persons who, because of handicap, need or are believed to 
need special education or related services which ensure that:
    (1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the 
specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained 
personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their 
producer;
    (2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to 
assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are 
designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and
    (3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, 
when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, 
or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports 
to measure, rather than

[[Page 339]]

reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills 
(except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to 
measure).
    (c) Placement procedures. In interpreting evaluation data and in 
making placement decisions, a recipient shall (1) draw upon information 
from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, 
teacher recommendations, physical condition, social or cultural 
background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to ensure 
that information obtained from all such sources is documented and 
carefully considered, (3) ensure that the placement decision is made by 
a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the 
meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, and (4) 
ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with Sec. 
84.34.
    (d) Reevaluation. A recipient to which this section applies shall 
establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, 
for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special 
education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with 
the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this 
requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 84.36  Procedural safeguards.

    A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education 
program shall establish and implement, with respect to actions regarding 
the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of persons who, 
because of handicap, need or are believed to need special instruction or 
related services, a system of procedural safeguards that includes 
notice, an opportunity for the parents or guardian of the person to 
examine relevant records, an impartial hearing with opportunity for 
participation by the person's parents or guardian and representation by 
counsel, and a review procedure. Compliance with the procedural 
safeguards of section 615 of the Education of the Handicapped Act is one 
means of meeting this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 84.37  Nonacademic services.

    (a) General. (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall 
provide non-academic and extracurricular services and activities in such 
manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal 
opportunity for participation in such services and activities.
    (2) Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may 
include counseling services, physical recreational athletics, 
transportation, health services, recreational activities, special 
interest groups or clubs sponsored by the recipients, referrals to 
agencies which provide assistance to handicapped persons, and employment 
of students, including both employment by the recipient and assistance 
in making available outside employment.
    (b) Counseling services. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or 
placement services to its students shall provide these services without 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. The recipient shall ensure that 
qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive 
career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar 
interests and abilities.
    (c) Physical education and athletics. (1) In providing physical 
education courses and athletics and similar programs and activities to 
any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical 
education courses or that operates or sponsors interscholastic, club, or 
intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an 
equal opportunity for participation in these activities.
    (2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education 
and athletic activities that are separate or different from those 
offered to nonhandicapped students only if separation or differentiation 
is consistent with the requirements of Sec. 84.34 and only if no 
qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for 
teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.

<R05>
Sec. 84.38  Preschool and adult education programs.

    A recipient to which this subpart applies that operates a preschool 
education or day care program or activity or an adult education program 
or activity may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude qualified 
handicapped persons from the program or activity and shall take into 
account the needs of such persons in determining the aid, benefits, or 
services to be provided under the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 84.39  Private education programs.

    (a) A recipient that operates a private elementary or secondary 
education program may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude a qualified 
handicapped person from such program if the person can, with minor 
adjustments, be provided an appropriate education, as defined in Sec. 
84.33(b)(1), within the recipient's program.
    (b) A recipient to which this section applies may not charge more 
for the provision of an appropriate education to handicapped persons 
than to nonhandicapped persons except to the extent that any additional 
charge is justified by a substantial increase in cost to the recipient.
    (c) A recipient to which this section applies that operates special 
education programs shall operate such programs in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec.Sec. 84.35 and 84.36. Each recipient to which this 
section applies is subject to the provisions of Sec.Sec. 84.34, 84.37, 
and 84.38.

admission or recruitment by a recipient to which this subpart applies.
    (b) Admissions. In administering its admission policies, a recipient 
to which this subpart applies:
    (1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of 
handicapped persons who may be admitted;
    (2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has 
a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class 
of handicapped persons unless (i) the test or criterion, as used by the 
recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education 
program or activity in question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria 
that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the 
Director to be available.
    (3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and 
administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to 
an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports 
to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are 
designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills 
are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions 
tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, 
on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not 
make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a 
handicapped person but, after admission, may make inquiries on a 
confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.
    (c) Preadmission inquiry exception. When a recipient is taking 
remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant 
to Sec. 84.6(a) or

[[Page 341]]

when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of 
conditons that resulted in limited participation in its federally 
assisted program or activity pursuant to Sec. 84.6(b), the recipient may 
invite applicants for admission to indicate whether and to what extent 
they are handicapped, Provided, That:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is 
used that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action 
efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that 
refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse 
treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (d) Validity studies. For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, 
but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of 
overall success in the education program or activity in question in 
order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.


<R05>
Sec. 84.43  Treatment of students; general.

    (a) No qualified handicapped student shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any academic, 
research, occupational training, housing, health insurance, counseling, 
financial aid, physical education, athletics, recreation, 
transportation, other extracurricular, or other postsecondary education 
program or activity to which this subpart applies.
    (b) A recipient to which this subpart applies that considers 
participation by students in education programs or activities not 
operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, and 
education program or activity operated by the recipient shall assure 
itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, 
provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified 
handicapped persons.

<R05>
Sec. 84.44  Academic adjustments.

    (a) Academic requirements. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall make such modifications to its academic requirements as are 
necessary to ensure that such requirements do not discriminate or have 
the effect of discriminating, on the basis of handicap, against a 
qualified handicapped applicant or student. Academic requirements that 
the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the program of 
instruction being pursued by such student or to any directly related 
licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the 
meaning of this section. Modifications may include changes in the length 
of time permitted for the completion of degree requirements, 
substitution of specific courses required for the completion of degree 
requirements, and adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are 
conducted.
    (b) Other rules. A recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibition of 
tape recorders in classrooms or of dog guides in campus buildings, that 
have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in 
the recipient's education program or activity.
    (c) Course examinations. In its course examinations or other 
procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement in its program, 
a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for 
evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results 
of the evaluation represents the student's achievement in the course, 
rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills (except where

[[Page 342]]

such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).
    (d) Auxiliary aids. (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped 
student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or 
otherwise subjected to discrimination under the education program or 
activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of educational 
auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills.

manner that discriminates against qualified handicapped persons on the 
basis of handicap.
    (2) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of 
scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance 
established under wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments 
that require awards to be made on the basis of factors that discriminate 
or have the effect of discrim inating on the basis of handicap only if 
the overall effect of the award of scholarships, fellowships, and other 
forms of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of 
handicap.
    (b) Assistance in making available outside employment. A recipient 
that assists any agency, organization, or person in providing employment 
opportunities to any of its students shall assure itself that such 
employment opportunities, as a whole, are made available in a manner

not separate or different.
    (b) Counseling and placement services. A recipient to which this 
subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational 
counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall 
provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap. 
The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not 
counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are 
nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities. This 
requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factual 
information about licensing and certification requirements that may 
present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular 
careers.
    (c) Social organizations. A recipient that provides significant 
assistance to fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall 
assure itself that the membership practices of such organizations do not 
permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by this subpart.

Sec. 84.54  Education of institutionalized persons.

    A recipient to which this subpart applies and that operates or 
supervises a program or activity for persons who are institutionalized 
because of handicap shall ensure that each qualified handicapped person, 
as defined in Sec. 84.3(k)(2), in its program or activity is provided an 
appropriate education, as defined in Sec. 84.33(b). Nothing in this 
section shall be interpreted as altering in any way the obligations of 
recipients under Subpart D.


<R05>
Sec. 84.55  Procedures relating to health care for handicapped infants.

    (a) Infant Care Review Committees. The Department encourages each 
recipient health care provider that provides health care services to 
infants in programs receiving Federal financial assistance to establish 
an Infant Care Review Committee (ICRC) to assist the provider in 
delivering health care and related services to infants and in complying 
with this part. The purpose of the committee is to assist the health 
care provider in the development of standards, policies and procedures 
for providing treatment to handicapped infants and in making decisions 
concerning medically beneficial treatment in specific cases. While the 
Department recognizes the value of ICRC's in assuring appropriate 
medical care to infants, such committees are not required by this 
section. An ICRC should be composed of individuals representing a broad 
range of perspectives, and should include a practicing physician, a 
representative of a disability organization, a practicing nurse, and 
other individuals. A suggested model ICRC is set forth in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (b) Posting of informational notice. (1) Each recipient health care 
provider that provides health care services to infants in programs or 
activities receiving Federal financial assistance shall post and keep 
posted in appropriate places an informational notice.
    (2) The notice must be posted at location(s) where nurses and other 
medical professionals who are engaged in providing health care and 
related services to infants will see it. To the extent it does not 
impair accomplishment of the requirement that copies of the notice be 
posted where such personnel will see it, the notice need not be posted 
in area(s) where parents of infant patients will see it.
    (3) Each health care provider for which the content of the following 
notice (identified as Notice A) is truthful may use Notice A. For the 
content of the notice to be truthful: (i) The provider must have a 
policy consistent with that stated in the notice; (ii) the provider must 
have a procedure for review of treatment deliberations and decisions to 
which the notice applies, such as (but not limited to) an Infant Care 
Review Committee; and (iii) the statements concerning the identity of 
callers and retaliation are truthful.

                                Notice A:

               PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT OF DISABLED INFANTS

    It is the policy of this hospital, consistent with Federal law, 
that, nourishment and medically beneficial treatment (as determined with 
respect for reasonable medical judgments) should not be withheld from 
handicapped infants solely on the basis of their present or anticipated 
mental or physical impairments.
    This Federal law, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or 
activities receiving Federal financial assistance. For further 
information, or to report suspected noncompliance, call:
    [Identify designated hospital contact point and telephone number] or
    [Identify appropriate child protective services agency and telephone 
number] or
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): 800-368-1019 
(Toll-free; available 24 hours a day; TDD capability).

The identity of callers will be held confidential. Retaliation by this 
hospital against any person for providing information about possible 
noncompliance is prohibited by this hospital and Federal regulations.

    (4) Health care providers other than those described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section must post the following notice (identified as 
Notice B):

                                Notice B:

               PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT OF DISABLED INFANTS

    Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap. Under 
this law, nourishment and medically beneficial treatment (as determined 
with respect for reasonable

[[Page 345]]

medical judgments) should not be withheld from handicapped infants 
solely on the basis of their present or anticipated mental or physical 
impairments.
    This Federal law, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
applies to programs or activities receiving Federal financial 
assistance. For further information, or to report suspected 
noncompliance, call:
    [Identify appropriate child protective services agency and telephone 
number] or
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): 800-368-1019 
(Toll-free; available 24 hours a day: TDD capability)

The identity of callers will be held confidential. Federal regulations 
prohibit retaliation by this hospital against any person who provides 
information about possible violations.

    (5) The notice may be no smaller than 5 by 7 inches, and the type 
size no smaller than that generally used for similar internal 
communications to staff. The recipient must insert the specified 
information on the notice it selects. Recipient hospitals in Washington, 
DC, must list 863-0100 as the telephone number for HHS. No other 
alterations may be made to the notice. Copies of the notices may be 
obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services upon request, 
or the recipient may produce its own notices in conformance with the 
specified wording.
    (c) Responsibilities of recipient state child protective services 
agencies. (1) Within 60 days of the effective date of this section, each 
recipient state child protective services agency shall establish and 
maintain in written form methods of administration and procedures to 
assure that the agency utilizes its full authority pursuant to state law 
to prevent instances of unlawful medical neglect of handicapped infants. 
These methods of administration and procedures shall include:
    (i) A requirement that health care providers report on a timely 
basis to the state agency circumstances which they determine to 
constitute known or suspected instances of unlawful medical neglect of 
handicapped infants;
    (ii) A method by which the state agency can receive reports of 
suspected unlawful medical neglect of handicapped infants from health 
care providers, other individuals, and the Department on a timely basis;
    (iii) Immediate review of reports of suspected unlawful medical 
neglect of handicapped infants and, where appropriate, on-site 
investigation of such reports;
    (iv) Provision of child protective services to such medically 
neglected handicapped infants, including, where appropriate, seeking a 
timely court order to compel the provision of necessary nourishment and 
medical treatment; and
    (v) Timely notification to the responsible Department official of 
each report of suspected unlawful medical neglect involving the 
withholding, solely on the basis of present or anticipated physical or 
mental impairments, of treatment or nourishment from a handicapped 
infant who, in spite of such impairments, will medically benefit from 
the treatment or nourishment, the steps taken by the state agency to 
investigate such report, and the state agency's final disposition of 
such report.
    (2) Whenever a hospital at which an infant who is the subject of a 
report of suspected unlawful medical neglect is being treated has an 
Infant Care Review Committee (ICRC) the Department encourages the state 
child protective services agency to consult with the ICRC in carrying 
out the state agency's authorities under its state law and methods of 
administration. In developing its methods of administration and 
procedures, the Department encourages child protective services agencies 
to adopt guidelines for investigations similar to those of the 
Department regarding the involvement of ICRC's.
    (d) Expedited access to records. Access to pertinent records and 
facilities of a recipient pursuant to 45 CFR 80.6(c) (made applicable to 
this part by 45 CFR 84.61) shall not be limited to normal business hours 
when, in the judgment of the responsible Department official, immediate 
access is necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped 
individual.
    (e) Expedited action to effect compliance. The requirement of 45 CFR 
80.8(d)(3) pertaining to notice to recipients prior to the initiation of 
action to effect compliance (made applicable to this part by 45 CFR 
84.61) shall not

[[Page 346]]

apply when, in the judgment of the responsible Department official, 
immediate action to effect compliance is necessary to protect the life 
or health of a handicapped individual. In such cases the recipient will, 
as soon as practicable, be given oral or written notice of its failure 
to comply, of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and its 
continuing opportunity to comply voluntarily.
    (f) Model Infant Care Review Committee. Recipient health care 
providers wishing to establish Infant Care Review Committees should 
consider adoption of the following model. This model is advisory. 
Recipient health care providers are not required to establish a review 
committee or, if one is established, to adhere to this model. In seeking 
to determine compliance with this part, as it relates to health care for 
handicapped infants, by health care providers that have an ICRC 
established and operated substantially in accordance with this model, 
the Department will, to the extent possible, consult with the ICRC.
    (1) Establishment and purpose. (i) The hospital establishes an 
Infant Care Review Committee (ICRC) or joins with one or more other 
hospitals to create a joint ICRC. The establishing document will state 
that the ICRC is for the purpose of facilitating the development and 
implementation of standards, policies and procedures designed to assure 
that, while respecting reasonable medical judgments, treatment and 
nourishment not be withheld, solely on the basis of present or 
anticipated physical or mental impairments, from handicapped infants 
who, in spite of such impairments, will benefit medically from the 
treatment or nourishment.
    (ii) The activities of the ICRC will be guided by the following 
principles:
    (A) The interpretative guidelines of the Department relating to the 
applicability of this part to health care for handicapped infants.
    (B) As stated in the ``Principles of Treatment of Disabled Infants'' 
of the coalition of major medical and disability organizations, 
including the American Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of 
Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, Association for Retarded 
Citizens, Down's Syndrome Congress, Spina Bifida Association, and 
others:

    When medical care is clearly beneficial, it should always be 
provided. When appropriate medical care is not available, arrangements 
should be made to transfer the infant to an appropriate medical 
facility. Consideration such as anticipated or actual limited potential 
of an individual and present or future lack of available community 
resources are irrelevant and must not determine the decisions concerning 
medical care. The individual's medical condition should be the sole 
focus of the decision. These are very strict standards.
    It is ethically and legally justified to withhold medical or 
surgical procedures which are clearly futile and will only prolong the 
act of dying. However, supportive care should be provided, including 
sustenance as medically indicated and relief of pain and suffering. The 
needs of the dying person should be respected. The family also should be 
supported in its grieving.
    In cases where it is uncertain whether medical treatment will be 
beneficial, a person's disability must not be the basis for a decision 
to withhold treatment. At all times during the process when decisions 
are being made about the benefit or futility of medical treatment, the 
person should be cared for in the medically most appropriate ways. When 
doubt exists at any time about whether to treat, a presumption always 
should be in favor of treatment.

    (C) As stated by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical 
Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research:

    This [standard for providing medically beneficial treatment] is a 
very strict standard in that it excludes consideration of the negative 
effects of an impaired child's life on other persons, including parents, 
siblings, and society. Although abiding by this standard may be 
difficult in specific cases, it is all too easy to undervalue the lives 
of handicapped infants; the Commission finds it imperative to counteract 
this by treating them no less vigorously than their healthy peers or 
than older children with similar handicaps would be treated.

    (iii) The ICRC will carry out its purposes by:
    (A) Recommending institutional policies concerning the withholding 
or withdrawal of medical or surgical treatments to infants, including 
guidelines for ICRC action for specific categories of life-threatening 
conditions affecting infants;

[[Page 347]]

    (B) Providing advice in specific cases when decisions are being 
considered to withhold or withdraw from infant life-sustaining medical 
or surgical treatment; and
    (C) Reviewing retrospectively on a regular basis infant medical 
records in situations in which life-sustaining medical or surgical 
treatment has been withheld or withdrawn.
    (2) Organization and staffing. The ICRC will consist of at least 7 
members and include the following:
    (i) A practicing physician (e.g., a pediatrician, a neonatologist, 
or a pediatric surgeon),
    (ii) A practicing nurse,
    (iii) A hospital administrator,
    (iv) A representative of the legal profession,
    (v) A representative of a disability group, or a developmental 
disability expert,
    (vi) A lay community member, and
    (vii) A member of a facility's organized medical staff, who shall 
serve as chairperson.

In connection with review of specific cases, one member of the ICRC 
shall be designated to act as ``special advocate'' for the infant, as 
provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(E) of the section. The hospital will 
provide staff support for the ICRC, including legal counsel. The ICRC 
will meet on a regular basis, or as required below in connection with 
review of specific cases. It shall adopt or recommend to the appropriate 
hospital official or body such administrative policies as terms of 
office and quorum requirements. The ICRC will recommend procedures to 
ensure that both hospital personnel and patient families are fully 
informed of the existence and functions of the ICRC and its availability 
on a 24-hour basis.
    (3) Operation of ICRC--(i) Prospective policy development. (A) The 
ICRC will develop and recommend for adoption by the hospital 
institutional policies concerning the withholding or withdrawal of 
medical treatment for infants with life-threatening conditions. These 
will include guidelines for management of specific types of cases or 
diagnoses, for example, Down's syndrome and spina bifida, and procedures 
to be followed in such recurring circumstances as, for example, brain 
death and parental refusal to consent to life-saving treatment. The 
hospital, upon recommendation of the ICRC, may require attending 
physicians to notify the ICRC of the presence in the facility of an 
infant with a diagnosis specified by the ICRC, e.g., Down's syndrome and 
spina bifida.
    (B) In recommending these policies and guidelines, the ICRC will 
consult with medical and other authorities on issues involving disabled 
individuals, e.g., neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, county and city 
agencies which provide services for the disabled, and disability 
advocacy organizations. It will also consult with appropriate committees 
of the medical staff, to ensure that the ICRC policies and guidelines 
build on existing staff by-laws, rules and regulations concerning 
consultations and staff membership requirements. The ICRC will also 
inform and educate hospital staff on the policies and guidelines it 
develops.
    (ii) Review of specific cases. In addition to regularly scheduled 
meetings, interim ICRC meetings will take place under specified 
circumstances to permit review of individual cases. The hospital will, 
to the extent possible, require in each case that life-sustaining 
treatment be continued, until the ICRC can review the case and provide 
advice.
    (A) Interim ICRC meetings will be convened within 24 hours (or less 
if indicated) when there is disagreement between the family of an infant 
and the infant's physician as to the withholding or withdrawal of 
treatment, when a preliminary decision to withhold or withdraw life-
sustaining treatment has been made in certain categories of cases 
identified by the ICRC, when there is disagreement between members of 
the hospital's medical and/or nursing staffs, or when otherwise 
appropriate.
    (B) Such interim ICRC meetings will take place upon the request of 
any member of the ICRC or hospital staff or parent or guardian of the 
infant. The ICRC will have procedures to preserve the confidentiality of 
the identity of persons making such requests, and such persons shall be 
protected from reprisal. When appropriate, the ICRC or a designated 
member will inform the

[[Page 348]]

requesting individual of the ICRC's recommendation.
    (C) The ICRC may provide for telephone and other forms of review 
when the timing and nature of the case, as identified in policies 
developed by the ICRC, make the convening of an interim meeting 
impracticable.
    (D) Interim meetings will be open to the affected parties. The ICRC 
will ensure that the interests of the parents, the physician, and the 
child are fully considered; that family members have been fully informed 
of the patient's condition and prognosis; that they have been provided 
with a listing which describes the services furnished by parent support 
groups and public and private agencies in the geographic vicinity to 
infants with conditions such as that before the ICRC; and that the ICRC 
will facilitate their access to such services and groups.
    (E) To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of all options and factors 
pertinent to the committee's deliberations, the chairperson will 
designate one member of the ICRC to act, in connection with that 
specific case, as special advocate for the infant. The special advocate 
will seek to ensure that all considerations in favor of the provision of 
life-sustaining treatment are fully evaluated and considered by the 
ICRC.
    (F) In cases in which there is disagreement on treatment between a 
physician and an infant's family, and the family wishes to continue 
life-sustaining treatment, the family's wishes will be carried out, for 
as long as the family wishes, unless such treatment is medically 
contraindicated. When there is physician/family disagreement and the 
family refuses consent to life-sustaining treatment, and the ICRC, after 
due deliberation, agrees with the family, the ICRC will recommend that 
the treatment be withheld. When there is physician/family disagreement 
and the family refuses consent, but the ICRC disagrees with the family, 
the ICRC will recommend to the hospital board or appropriate official 
that the case be referred immediately to an appropriate court or child 
protective agency, and every effort shall be made to continue treatment, 
preserve the status quo, and prevent worsening of the infant's condition 
until such time as the court or agency renders a decision or takes other 
appropriate action. The ICRC will also follow this procedure in cases in 
which the family and physician agree that life-sustaining treatment 
should be withheld or withdrawn, but the ICRC disagrees.
    (iii) Retrospective record review. The ICRC, at its regularly-
scheduled meeting, will review all records involving withholding or 
termination of medical or surgical treatment to infants consistent with 
hospital policies developed by the ICRC, unless the case was previously 
before the ICRC pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. If the 
ICRC finds that a deviation was made from the institutional policies in 
a given case, it shall conduct a review and report the findings to 
appropriate hospital personnel for appropriate action.
    (4) Records. The ICRC will maintain records of all of its 
deliberations and summary descriptions of specific cases considered and 
the disposition of those cases. Such records will be kept in accordance 
with institutional policies on confidentiality of medical information. 
They will be made available to appropriate government agencies, or upon 
court order, or as otherwise required by law.
    Note: The mandatory provisions set forth in paragraphs (b)--(e) 
inclusive of this section are subject to an injunction prohibiting their 
enforcement. In Bowen v. American Hospital Association, ------ U.S. ----
--, 106 S. Ct. 2101 (1986), the Supreme Court upheld the action of a 
United States District Court, 585 F. Supp. 541 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), 
declaring invalid and enjoining enforcement of provisions under this 
section, promulgated January 12, 1984.

           Appendix A to Part 84--Analysis of Final Regulation

                      subpart a--general provisions

    Definitions--1. ``Recipient''. Section 84.23 contains definitions 
used throughout the regulation. Most of the comments concerning Sec. 
84.3(f), which contains the definition of ``recipient,'' commended the 
inclusion of recipient whose sole source of Federal financial assistance 
is Medicaid. The Secretary believes that such Medicaid providers should 
be regarded as recipients under the statute and the regulation and 
should be held individually responsible for administering services in a 
nondiscriminatory fashion. Accordingly, Sec. 84.3(f) has not been 
changed. Small Medicaid providers, however, are exempt from some of the 
regulation's administrative provisions (those that apply to recipients 
with fifteen or more employees). And such recipients will be permitted 
to refer patients to accessible facilities in certain limited 
circumstances under revised Sec. 84.22(b). The Secretary recognizes the 
difficulties involved in Federal enforcement of this regulation with 
respect to thousands of individual Medicaid providers. As in the case of 
title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Office for Civil Rights 
will concentrate its compliance efforts on the state Medicaid agencies 
and will look primarily to them to ensure compliance by individual 
providers.
    One other comment requested that the regulation specify that 
nonpublic elementary and secondary schools that are not otherwise 
recipients do not become recipients by virtue of the fact their students 
participate in certain federally funded programs. The Secretary believes 
it unnecessary to amend the regulation in this regard, because almost 
identical language in the Department's regulations implementing title VI 
and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has consistently been 
interpreted so as not to render such schools recipients. These schools, 
however, are indirectly subject to the substantive requirements of this 
regulation through the application of Sec. 84.4(b)(iv), which prohibits 
recipients from assisting agencies that discriminate on the basis of 
handicap in providing services to beneficiairies of the recipients' 
programs.
    2. ``Federal financial assistance''. In Sec. 84.3(h), defining 
Federal financial assistance, a clarifying change has been made: 
procurement contracts are specifically excluded. They are covered, 
however, by the Department of Labor's regulation under section 503. The 
Department has never considered such contracts to be contracts of 
assistance; the explicit exemption has been added only to avoid possible 
confusion.
    The proposed regulation's exemption of contracts of insurance or 
guaranty has been retained. A number of comments argued for its deletion 
on the ground that section 504, unlike title VI and title IX, contains 
no statutory exemption for such contracts. There is no indication, 
however, in the legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or 
of the amendments to that Act in 1974, that Congress intended section 
504 to have a broader application, in terms of Federal financial 
assistance, than other civil rights statutes. Indeed, Congress directed 
that section 504 be implemented in the same manner as titles VI and IX. 
In view of the long established exemption of contracts of insurance or 
guaranty under title VI, we think it unlikely that Congress intended 
section 504 to apply to such contracts.
    In its May 1976 Notice of Intent, the Department suggested that the 
arrangement under which individual practitioners, hospitals, and other 
facilities receive reimbursement for providing services to beneficiaries 
under Part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) 
constitutes a contract of insurance or guaranty and thus falls within 
the exemption from the regulation. This explanation oversimplified the 
Department's view of whether Medicare Part B constitutes Federal 
financial assistance. The Department's position has consistently been 
that, whether or not Medicare Part B arrangements involve a contract of 
insurance or guaranty, no Federal financial assistance flows from the 
Department to the doctor or other practitioner under the program, since 
Medicare Part B--like other social security programs--is basically a 
program of payments to direct beneficiaries.
    3. ``Handicapped person''. Section 84.3(j), which defines the class 
of persons protected under the regulation, has not been substantially 
changed. The definition of handicapped person in paragraph (j)(1) 
conforms to the statutory definition of handicapped person that is 
applicable to section 504, as set forth in section 111(a) of the 
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-516.
    The first of the three parts of the statutory and regulatory 
definition includes any person who has a physical or mental impairment 
that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Paragraph 
(j)(2)(i) further defines physical or mental impairments. The definition 
does not set forth a list of specific diseases and conditions that 
constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of 
ensuring the comprehensiveness of any such list. The term includes, 
however, such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and 
hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular

[[Page 350]]

dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental 
retardation, emotional illness, and, as discussed below, drug addiction 
and alcoholism.
    It should be emphasized that a physical or mental impairment does 
not constitute a handicap for purposes of section 504 unless its 
severity is such that it results in a substantial limitation of one or 
more major life activities. Several comments observed the lack of any 
definition in the proposed regulation of the phrase ``substantially 
limits.'' The Department does not believe that a definition of this term 
is possible at this time.
    A related issue raised by several comments is whether the definition 
of handicapped person is unreasonably broad. Comments suggested 
narrowing the definition in various ways. the most common recommendation 
was that only ``traditional'' handicaps be covered. The Department 
continues to believe, however, that it has no flexibility within the 
statutory definition to limit the term to persons who have those severe, 
permanent, or progressive conditions that are most commonly regarded as 
handicaps. The Department intends, however, to give particular attention 
in its enforcement of section 504 to eliminating discrimination against 
persons with the severe handicaps that were the focus of concern in the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
    The definition of handicapped person also includes specific 
limitations on what persons are classified as handicapped under the 
regulation. The first of the three parts of the definition specifies 
that only physical and mental handicaps are included. Thus, 
environmental, cultural, and economic disadvantage are not in themselves 
covered; nor are prison records, age, or homosexuality. Of course, if a 
person who has any of these characteristics also has a physical or 
mental handicap, the person is included within the definition of 
handicapped person.
    In paragraph (j)(2)(i), physical or mental impairment is defined to 
include, among other impairments, specific learning disabilities. The 
Department will interpret the term as it is used in section 602 of the 
Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended. Paragraph (15) of section 
602 uses the term ``specific learning disabilities'' to describe such 
conditions as perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain 
dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.
    Paragraph (j)(2)(i) has been shortened, but not substantively 
changed, by the deletion of clause (C), which made explicit the 
inclusion of any condition which is mental or physical but whose precise 
nature is not at present known. Clauses (A) and (B) clearly comprehend 
such conditions.
    The second part of the statutory and regulatory definition of 
handicapped person includes any person who has a record of a physical or 
mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Under 
the definition of ``record'' in paragraph (j)(2)(iii), persons who have 
a history of a handicapping condition but no longer have the condition, 
as well as persons who have been incorrectly classified as having such a 
condition, are protected from discrimination under section 504. 
Frequently occurring examples of the first group are persons with 
histories of mental or emotional illness, heart disease, or cancer; of 
the second group, persons who have been misclassified as mentally 
retarded.
    The third part of the statutory and regulatory definition of 
handicapped person includes any person who is regarded as having a 
physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more 
major life activities. It includes many persons who are ordinarily 
considered to be handicapped but who do not technically fall within the 
first two parts of the statutory definition, such as persons with a 
limp. This part of the definition also includes some persons who might 
not ordinarily be considered handicapped, such as persons with 
disfiguring scars, as well as persons who have no physical or mental 
impairment but are treated by a recipient as if they were handicapped.
    4. Drug addicts and alcoholics. As was the case during the first 
comment period, the issue of whether to include drug addicts and 
alcoholics within the definition of handicapped person was of major 
concern to many commenters. The arguments presented on each side of the 
issue were similar during the two comment periods, as was the preference 
of commenters for exclusion of this group of persons. While some 
comments reflected misconceptions about the implications of including 
alcoholics and drug addicts within the scope of the regulation, the 
Secretary understands the concerns that underlie the comments on this 
question and recognizes that application of section 504 to active 
alcoholics and drug addicts presents sensitive and difficult questions 
that must be taken into account in interpretation and enforcement.
    The Secretary has carefully examined the issue and has obtained a 
legal opinion from the Attorney General. That opinion concludes that 
drug addiction and alcoholism are ``physical or mental impairments'' 
within the meaning of section 7(6) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 
amended, and that drug addicts and alcoholics are therefore handicapped 
for purposes of section 504 if their impairment substantially limits one 
of their major life activities. The Secretary therefore believes that he 
is without authority to exclude these conditions from the definition. 
There is a medical and legal consensus that alcoholism and drug 
addiction are diseases, although there is disagreement as to whether 
they are primarily mental or physical. In addition, while Congress did 
not

[[Page 351]]

focus specifically on the problems of drug addiction and alcoholism in 
enacting section 504, the committees that considered the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973 were made aware of the Department's long-standing practice 
of treating addicts and alcoholics as handicapped individuals eligible 
for rehabilitation services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act.
    The Secretary wishes to reassure recipients that inclusion of 
addicts and alcoholics within the scope of the regulation will not lead 
to the consequences feared by many commenters. It cannot be emphasized 
too strongly that the statute and the regulation apply only to 
discrimination against qualified handicapped persons solely by reason of 
their handicap. The fact that drug addiction and alcoholism may be 
handicaps does not mean that these conditions must be ignored in 
determining whether an individual is qualified for services or 
employment opportunities. On the contrary, a recipient may hold a drug 
addict or alcoholic to the same standard of performance and behavior to 
which it holds others, even if any unsatisfactory performance or 
behavior is related to the person's drug addiction or alcoholism. In 
other words, while an alcoholic or drug addict may not be denied 
services or disqualified from employment solely because of his or her 
condition, the behavioral manifestations of the condition may be taken 
into account in determining whether he or she is qualified.
    With respect to the employment of a drug addict or alcoholic, if it 
can be shown that the addiction or alcoholism prevents successful 
performance of the job, the person need not be provided the employment 
opportunity in question. For example, in making employment decisions, a 
recipient may judge addicts and alcoholics on the same basis it judges 
all other applicants and employees. Thus, a recipient may consider--for 
all applicants including drug addicts and alcoholics--past personnel 
records, absenteeism, disruptive, abusive, or dangerous behavior, 
violations of rules and unsatisfactory work performance. Moreover, 
employers may enforce rules prohibiting the possesion or use of alcohol 
or drugs in the work-place, provided that such rules are enforced 
against all employees.
    With respect to services, there is evidence that drug addicts and 
alcoholics are often denied treatment at hospitals for conditions 
unrelated to their addiction or alcoholism. In addition, some addicts 
and alcoholics have been denied emergency treatment. These practices 
have been specifically prohibited by section 407 of the Drug Abuse 
Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (21 U.S.C. 1174) and section 321 of the 
Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and 
Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4581), as amended. These statutory 
provisions are also administered by the Department's Office for Civil 
Rights and are implemented in Sec. 84.53 of this regulation.
    With respect to other services, the implications of coverage, of 
alcoholics and drug addicts are two-fold: first, no person may be 
excluded from services solely by reason of the presence or history of 
these conditions; second, to the extent that the manifestations of the 
condition prevent the person from meeting the basic eligibility 
requirements of the program or cause substantial interference with the 
operation of the program, the condition may be taken into consideration. 
Thus, a college may not exclude an addict or alcoholic as a student, on 
the basis of addiction or alcoholism, if the person can successfully 
participate in the education program and complies with the rules of the 
college and if his or her behavior does not impede the performance of 
other students.
    Of great concern to many commenters was the question of what effect 
the inclusion of drug addicts and alcoholics as handicapped persons 
would have on school disciplinary rules prohibiting the use or 
possession of drugs or alcohol by students. Neither such rules nor their 
application to drug addicts or alcoholics is prohibited by this 
regulation, provided that the rules are enforced evenly with respect to 
all students.
    5. ``Qualified handicapped person.'' Paragraph (k) of Sec. 84.3 
defines the term ``qualified handicapped person.'' Throughout the 
regulation, this term is used instead of the statutory term ``otherwise 
qualified handicapped person.'' The Department believes that the 
omission of the word ``otherwise'' is necessary in order to comport with 
the intent of the statute because, read literally, ``otherwise'' 
qualified handicapped persons include persons who are qualified except 
for their handicap, rather than in spite of their handicap. Under such a 
literal reading, a blind person possessing all the qualifications for 
driving a bus except sight could be said to be ``otherwise qualified'' 
for the job of driving. Clearly, such a result was not intended by 
Congress. In all other respects, the terms ``qualified'' and ``otherwise 
qualified'' are intended to be interchangeable.
    Section 84.3(k)(1) defines a qualified handicapped person with 
respect to employment as a handicapped person who can, with reasonable 
accommodation, perform the essential functions of the job in question. 
The term ``essential functions'' does not appear in the corresponding 
provision of the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation, and a few 
commenters objected to its inclusion on the ground that a handicapped 
person should be able to perform all job tasks. However, the Department 
believes that inclusion of the phrase is useful in emphasizing that 
handicapped persons should not be disqualified simply because they may 
have difficulty

[[Page 352]]

in performing tasks that bear only a marginal relationship to a 
particular job. Further, we are convinced that inclusion of the phrase 
is not inconsistent with the Department of Labor's application of its 
definition.
    Certain commenters urged that the definition of qualified 
handicapped person be amended so as explicitly to place upon the 
employer the burden of showing that a particular mental or physical 
characteristic is essential. Because the same result is achieved by the 
requirement contained in paragraph (a) of Sec. 84.13, which requires an 
employer to establish that any selection criterion that tends to screen 
out handicapped persons is job-related, that recommendation has not been 
followed.
    Section 84.3(k)(2) (formerly Sec. 84.3(k)(3)) defines qualified 
handicapped person, with respect to preschool, elementary, and secondary 
programs, in terms of age. Several commenters recommended that 
eligibility for the services be based upon the standard of substantial 
benefit, rather than age, because of the need of many handicapped 
children for early or extended services if they are to have an equal 
opportunity to benefit from education programs. No change has been made 
in this provision, again because of the extreme difficulties in 
administration that would result from the choice of the former standard. 
Under the remedial action provisions of Sec. 84.6(a)(3), however, 
persons beyond the age limits prescribed in Sec. 84.3(k)(2) may in 
appropriate cases be required to be provided services that they were 
formerly denied because of a recipient's violation of section 504.
    Section 84.3(k)(2) states that a handicapped person is qualified for 
preschool, elementary, or secondary services if the person is of an age 
at which nonhandicapped persons are eligible for such services or at 
which state law mandates the provision of educational services to 
handicapped persons. In addition, the extended age ranges for which 
recipients must provide full educational opportunity to all handicapped 
persons in order to be eligible for assistance under the Education of 
the Handicapped Act--generally, 3-18 as of September 1978, and 3-21 as 
of September 1980 are incorporated by reference in this paragraph.
    Section 84.3(k)(3) formerly Sec. 84.3(k)(2)) defines qualified 
handicapped person with respect to postsecondary educational programs. 
As revised, the paragraph means that both academic and technical 
standards must be met by applicants to these programs. The term 
``technical standards'' refers to all nonacademic admissions criteria 
that are essential to participation in the program in question.
    6. General prohibitions against discrimination. Section 84.4 
contains general prohibitions against discrimination applicable to all 
recipients of assistance from this Department.
    Paragraph (b)(1(i) prohibits the exclusion of qualified handicapped 
persons from aids, benefits, or services, and paragraph (ii) requires 
that equal opportunity to participate or benefit be provided. Paragraph 
(iii) requires that services provided to handicapped persons be as 
effective as those provided to the nonhandicapped. In paragraph (iv), 
different or separate services are prohibited except when necessary to 
provide equally effective benefits.
    In this context, the term ``equally effective,'' defined in 
paragraph (b)(2), is intended to encompass the concept of equivalent, as 
opposed to identical, services and to acknowledge the fact that in order 
to meet the individual needs of handicapped persons to the same extent 
that the corresponding needs of nonhandicapped persons are met, 
adjustments to regular programs or the provision of different programs 
may sometimes be necessary. For example, a welfare office that uses the 
telephone for communicating with its clients must provide alternative 
modes of communicating with its deaf clients. This standard parallels 
the one established under title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964 with 
respect to the provision of educational services to students whose 
primary language is not English. See Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 
(1974). To be equally effective, however, an aid, benefit, or service 
need not produce equal results; it merely must afford an equal 
opportunity to achieve equal results.
    It must be emphasized that, although separate services must be 
required in some instances, the provision of unnecessarily separate or 
different services is discriminatory. The addition to paragraph (b)(2) 
of the phrase ``in the most integrated setting appropriated to the 
person's needs'' is intended to reinforce this general concept. A new 
paragraph (b)(3) has also been added to Sec. 84.4, requiring recipients 
to give qualified handicapped persons the option of participating in 
regular programs despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs. The requirement has been reiterated in Sec.Sec. 
84.38 and 84.47 in connection with physical education and athletics 
programs.
    Section 84.4(b)(1)(v) prohibits a recipient from supporting another 
entity or person that subjects participants or employees in the 
recipient's program to discrimination on the basis of handicap. This 
section would, for example, prohibit financial support by a recipient to 
a community recreational group or to a professional or social 
organization that discriminates against handicapped persons. Among the 
criteria to be considered in each case are the substantiality of the 
relationship between the recipient and the other entity, including 
financial support by the recipient, and whether the other entity's 
activities relate so closely to the recipient's program or activity that 
they fairly should

[[Page 353]]

be considered activities of the recipient itself. Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) 
was added in response to comment in order to make explicit the 
prohibition against denying qualified handicapped persons the 
opportunity to serve on planning and advisory boards responsible for 
guiding federally assisted programs or activities.
    Several comments appeared to interpret Sec. 84.4(b)(5), which 
proscribes discriminatory site selection, to prohibit a recipient that 
is located on hilly terrain from erecting any new buildings at its 
present site. That, of course, is not the case. This paragraph is not 
intended to apply to construction of additional buildings at an existing 
site. Of course, any such facilities must be made accessible in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 84.23.
    7. Assurances of compliance. Section 84.5(a) requires a recipient to 
submit to the Director an assurance that each of its programs and 
activities receiving or benefiting from Federal financial assistance 
from this Department will be conducted in compliance with this 
regulation. To facilitate the submission of assurances by thousands of 
Medicaid providers, the Department will follow the title VI procedures 
of accepting, in lieu of assurances, certification on Medicaid vouchers. 
Many commenters also sought relief from the paperwork requirements 
imposed by the Department's enforcement of its various civil rights 
responsibilities by requesting the Department to issue one form 
incorporating title VI, title IX, and section 504 assurances. The 
Secretary is sympathetic to this request. While it is not feasible to 
adopt a single civil rights assurance form at this time, the Office for 
Civil Rights will work toward that goal.
    8. Private rights of action. Several comments urged that the 
regulation incorporate provision granting beneficiaries a private right 
of action against recipients under section 504. To confer such a right 
is beyond the authority of the executive branch of Government. There is, 
however, case law holding that such a right exists. Lloyd v. Regional 
Transportation Authority, 548 F. 2d 1277 (7th Cir. 1977); see Hairston 
v. Drosick, Civil No. 75-0691 (S.D. W. Va., Jan. 14, 1976); Gurmankin v. 
Castanzo, 411 F. Supp. 982 (E.D. Pa. 1976); cf. Lau v. Nichols, supra.
    9. Remedial action. Where there has been a finding of 
discrimination, Sec. 84.6 requires a recipient to take remedial action 
to overcome the effects of the discrimination. Actions that might be 
required under paragraph (a)(1) include provision of services to persons 
previously discriminated against, reinstatement of employees and 
development of a remedial action plan. Should a recipient fail to take 
required remedial action, the ultimate sanctions of court action or 
termination of Federal financial assistance may be imposed.
    Paragraph (a)(2) extends the responsibility for taking remedial 
action to a recipient that exercises control over a noncomplying 
recipient. Paragraph (a)(3) also makes clear that handicapped persons 
who are not in the program at the time that remedial action is required 
to be taken may also be the subject of such remedial action. This 
paragraph has been revised in response to comments in order to include 
persons who would have been in the program if discriminatory practices 
had not existed. Paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) have also been amended 
in response to comments to make plain that, in appropriate cases, 
remedial action might be required to redress clear violations of the 
statute itself that occurred before the effective date of this 
regulation.
    10. Voluntary action. In Sec. 84.6(b), the term ``voluntary action'' 
has been substituted for the term ``affirmative action'' because the use 
of the latter term led to some confusion. We believe the term 
``voluntary action'' more accurately reflects the purpose of the 
paragraph. This provision allows action, beyond that required by the 
regulation, to overcome conditions that led to limited participation by 
handicapped persons, whether or not the limited participation was caused 
by any discriminatory actions on the part of the recipient. Several 
commenters urged that paragraphs (a) and (b) be revised to require 
remedial action to overcome effects of prior discriminatory practices 
regardless of whether there has been an express finding of 
discrimination. The self-evaluation requirement in paragraph (c) 
accomplishes much the same purpose.
    11. Self-evaluation. Paragraph (c) requires recipients to conduct a 
self-evaluation in order to determine whether their policies or 
practices may discriminate against handicapped persons and to take steps 
to modify any discriminatory policies and practices and their effects. 
The Department received many comments approving of the addition to 
paragraph (c) of a requirement that recipients seek the assistance of 
handicapped persons in the self-evaluation process. This paragraph has 
been further amended to require consultation with handicapped persons or 
organizations representing them before recipients undertake the policy 
modifications and remedial steps prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(iii).
    Paragraph (c)(2), which sets forth the recordkeeping requirements 
concerning self-evaluation, now applies only to recipients with fifteen 
or more employees. This change was made as part of an effort to reduce 
unnecessary or counterproductive administrative obligations on small 
recipients. For those recipients required to keep records, the 
requirements have been made more specific; records must include a list 
of persons consulted and a description of areas examined, problems 
identified, and corrective steps

[[Page 354]]

taken. Moreover, the records must be made available for public 
inspection.
    12. Grievance procedure. Section 84.7 (formerly Sec. 84.8) requires 
recipients with fifteen or more employees to designate an individual 
responsible for coordinating its compliance efforts and to adopt a 
grievance procedure. Two changes were made in the section in response to 
comment. A general requirement that appropriate due process procedures 
be followed has been added. It was decided that the details of such 
procedures could not at this time be specified because of the varied 
nature of the persons and entities who must establish the procedures and 
of the programs to which they apply. A sentence was also added to make 
clear that grievance procedures are not required to be made available to 
unsuccessful applicants for employment or to applicants for admission to 
colleges and universities.
    The regulation does not require that grievance procedures be 
exhausted before recourse is sought from the Department. However, the 
Secretary believes that it is desirable and efficient in many cases for 
complainants to seek resolution of their complaints and disputes at the 
local level and therefore encourages them to use available grievance 
procedures.
    A number of comments asked whether compliance with this section or 
the notice requirements of Sec. 84.8 could be coordinated with 
comparable action required by the title IX regulation. The Department 
encourages such efforts.
    13. Notice. Section 84.8 (formerly Sec. 84.9) sets forth 
requirements for dissemination of statements of nondicrimination policy 
by recipients.
    It is important that both handicapped persons and the public at 
large be aware of the obligations of recipients under section 504. Both 
the Department and recipients have responsibilities in this regard. 
Indeed the Department intends to undertake a major public information 
effort to inform persons of their rights under section 504 and this 
regulation. In Sec. 84.8 the Department has sought to impose a clear 
obligation on major recipients to notify beneficiaries and employees of 
the requirements of section 504, without dictating the precise way in 
which this notice must be given. At the same time, we have avoided 
imposing requirements on small recipients (those with fewer than fifteen 
employees) that would create unnecessary and counterproductive paper 
work burdens on them and unduly stretch the enforcement resources of the 
Department.
    Section 84.8(a), as simplified, requires recipients with fifteen or 
more employees to take appropriate steps to notify beneficiaries and 
employees of the recipient's obligations under section 504. The last 
sentence of Sec. 84.8(a) has been revised to list possible, rather than 
required, means of notification. Section 84.8(b) requires recipients to 
include a notification of their policy of nondiscrimination in 
recruitment and other general information materials.
    In response to a number of comments, Sec. 84.8 has been revised to 
delete the requirements of publication in local newspapers, which has 
proved to be both troublesome and ineffective. Several commenters 
suggested that notification on separate forms be allowed until present 
stocks of publications and forms are depleted. The final regulation 
explicitly allows this method of compliance. The separate form should, 
however, be included with each significant publication or form that is 
distributed.
    Former Sec. 84.9(b)(2), which prohibited the use of materials that 
might give the impression that a recipient excludes qualified 
handicapped persons from its program, has been deleted. The Department 
is convinced by the comments that this provision is unnecessary and 
difficult to apply. The Department encourages recipients, however, to 
include in their recruitment and other general information materials 
photographs of handicapped persons and ramps and other features of 
accessible buildings.
    Under new Sec. 84.9 the Director may, under certain circumstances, 
require recipients with fewer than fifteen employees to comply with one 
or more of these requirements. Thus, if experience shows a need for 
imposing notice or other requirements on particular recipients or 
classes of small recipients, the Department is prepared to expand the 
coverage of these sections.
    14. Inconsistent State laws. Section 84.10(a) states that compliance 
with the regulation is not excused by state or local laws limiting the 
eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive services or to 
practice an occupation. The provision thus applies only with respect to 
state or local laws that unjustifiably differentiate on the basis of 
handicap.
    Paragraph (b) further points out that the presence of limited 
employment opportunities in a particular profession, does not excuse a 
recipient from complying with the regulation. Thus, a law school could 
not deny admission to a blind applicant because blind laywers may find 
it more difficult to find jobs that do nonhandicapped lawyers.

                     subpart b--employment practices

    Subpart B prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in the 
employment practices of recipients of Federal financial assistance 
administered by the Department. This subpart is consistent with the 
employment provisions of the Department's regulation implementing title 
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (45 CFR Part 86) and the 
regulation of the Department of Labor under section 503 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, which requries certain Federal contractors to take

[[Page 355]]

affirmative action in the employment and advancement of qualified 
handicapped persons. All recipients subject to title IX are also subject 
to this regulation. In addition, many recipients subject to this 
regulation receive Federal procurement contracts in excess of $2,500 and 
are therefore also subject to section 503.
    15. Discriminatory practices. Section 84.11 sets forth general 
provisions with respect to discrimination in employment. A new paragraph 
(a)(2) has been added to clarify the employment obligations of 
recipients that receive Federal funds under Part B of the Education of 
the Handicapped Act, as amended (EHA). Section 606 of the EHA obligates 
elementary or secondary school systems that receive EHA funds to take 
positive steps to employ and advance in employment qualified handicapped 
persons. This obligation is similar to the nondiscrimination requirement 
of section 504 but requires recipients to take additional steps to hire 
and promote handicapped persons. In enacting section 606 Congress chose 
the words ``positive steps'' instead of ``affirmative action'' advisedly 
and did not intend section 606 to incorporate the types of activities 
required under Executive Order 11246 (affirmative action on the basis of 
race, color, sex, or national origin) or under sections 501 and 503 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
    Paragraph (b) of Sec. 84.11 sets forth the specific aspects of 
employment covered by the regulation. Paragraph (c) provides that 
inconsistent provisions of collective bargaining agreements do not 
excuse noncompliance.
    16. Reasonable accommodation. The reasonable accommodation 
requirement of Sec. 84.12 generated a substantial number of comments. 
The Department remains convinced that its approach is both fair and 
effective. Moreover, the Department of Labor reports that it has 
experienced little difficulty in administering the requirements of 
reasonable accommodation. The provision therefore remains basically 
unchanged from the proposed regulation.
    Section 84.12 requires a recipient to make reasonable accommodation 
to the known physical or mental limitations of a handicapped applicant 
or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation 
would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. Where a 
handicapped person is not qualified to perform a particular job, where 
reasonable accommodation does not overcome the effects of a person's 
handicap, or where reasonable accommodation causes undue hardship to the 
employer, failure to hire or promote the handicapped person will not be 
considered discrimination.
    Section 84.12(b) lists some of the actions that constitute 
reasonable accommodation. The list is neither all-inclusive nor meant to 
suggest that employers must follow all of the actions listed.
    Reasonable accommodation includes modification of work schedules, 
including part-time employment, and job restructuring. Job restructuring 
may entail shifting nonessential duties to other employees. In other 
cases, reasonable accommodation may include physical modifications or 
relocation of particular offices or jobs so that they are in facilities 
or parts of facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons. If such accommodations would cause undue hardship to the 
employer, they need not be made.
    Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the factors that the Office 
for Civil Rights will consider in determining whether an accommodation 
necessary to enable an applicant or employee to perform the duties of a 
job would impose an undue hardship. The weight given to each of these 
factors in making the determination as to whether an accommodation 
constitutes undue hardship will vary depending on the facts of a 
particular situation. Thus, a small day-care center might not be 
required to expend more than a nominal sum, such as that necessary to 
equip a telephone for use by a secretary with impaired hearing, but a 
large school district might be required to make available a teacher's 
aide to a blind applicant for a teaching job. Further, it might be 
considered reasonable to require a state welfare agency to accommodate a 
deaf employee by providing an interpreter, while it would constitute an 
undue hardship to impose that requirement on a provider of foster home 
care services. The reasonable accommodation standard in Sec. 84.12 is 
similar to the obligation imposed upon Federal contractors in the 
regulation implementing section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
administered by the Department of Labor. Although the wording of the 
reasonable accommodation provisions of the two regulations is not 
identical, the obligation that the two regulations impose is the same, 
and the Federal Government's policy in implementing the two sections 
will be uniform. The Department adopted the factors listed in paragraph 
(c) instead of the ``business necessity'' standard of the Labor 
regulation because that term seemed inappropriate to the nature of the 
programs operated by the majority of institutions subject to this 
regulation, e.g., public school systems, hospitals, colleges and 
universities, nursing homes, day-care centers, and welfare offices. The 
factors listed in paragraph (c) are intended to make the rationale 
underlying the business necessity standard applicable to an 
understandable by recipients of HHS funds.
    17. Tests and selection criteria. Revised Sec. 84.13(a) prohibits 
employers from using test or other selection criteria that screen out or

[[Page 356]]

tend to screen out handicapped persons unless the test or criterion is 
shown to be job-related and alternative tests or criteria that do not 
screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped persons are not 
shown by the Director to be available. This paragraph is an application 
of the principle established under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 in Griggs v. Duke Power Company, 401 U.S. 424 (1971).
    Under the proposed section, a statistical showing of adverse impact 
on handicapped persons was required to trigger an employer's obligation 
to show that employment criteria and qualifications relating to handicap 
were necessary. This requirement was changed because the small number of 
handicapped persons taking tests would make statistical showings of 
``disproportionate, adverse effect'' difficult and burdensome. Under the 
altered, more workable provision, once it is shown that an employment 
test substantially limits the opportunities of handicapped persons, the 
employer must show the test to be job-related. A recipient is no longer 
limited to using predictive validity studies as the method for 
demonstrating that a test or other selection criterion is in fact job-
related. Nor, in all cases, are predictive validity studies sufficient 
to demonstrate that a test or criterion is job-related. In addition, 
Sec. 84.13(a) has been revised to place the burden on the Director, 
rather than the recipient, to identify alternate tests.
    Section 84.13(b) requires that a recipient take into account that 
some tests and criteria depend upon sensory, manual, or speaking skills 
that may not themselves be necessary to the job in question but that may 
make the handicapped person unable to pass the test. The recipient must 
select and administer tests so as best to ensure that the test will 
measure the handicapped person's ability to perform on the job rather 
than the person's ability to see, hear, speak, or perform manual tasks, 
except, of course, where such skills are the factors that the test 
purports to measure. For example, a person with a speech impediment may 
be perfectly qualified for jobs that do not or need not, with reasonable 
accommodation, require ability to speak clearly. Yet, if given an oral 
test, the person will be unable to perform in a satisfactory manner. The 
test results will not, therefore, predict job performance but instead 
will reflect impaired speech.
    18. Preemployment inquiries. Section 84.14, concerning preemployment 
inquiries, generated a large number of comments. Commenters representing 
handicapped persons strongly favored a ban on preemployment inquiries on 
the ground that such inquiries are often used to discriminate against 
handicapped persons and are not necessary to serve any legitimate 
interests of employers. Some recipients, on the other hand, argued that 
preemployment inquiries are necessary to determine qualifications of the 
applicant, safety hazards caused by a particular handicapping condition, 
and accommodations that might required.
    The Secretary has concluded that a general prohibition of 
preemployment inquiries is appropriate. However, a sentence has been 
added to paragraph (a) to make clear that an employer may inquire into 
an applicant's ability to perform job-related tasks but may not ask if 
the person has a handicap. For example, an employer may not ask on an 
employment form if an applicant is visually impaired but may ask if the 
person has a current driver's license (if that is a necessary 
qualification for the position in question). Similarly, employers may 
make inquiries about an applicant's ability to perform a job safely. 
Thus, an employer may not ask if an applicant is an epileptic but may 
ask whether the person can perform a particular job without endangering 
other employees.
    Section 84.14(B) allows preemployment inquiries only if they are 
made in conjunction with required remedial action to correct past 
discrimination, with voluntary action to overcome past conditions that 
have limited the participation of handicapped persons, or with 
obligations under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In 
these instances, paragraph (b) specifies certain safeguards that must be 
followed by the employer.
    Finally, the revised provision allows an employer to condition 
offers of employment to handicapped persons on the results of medical 
examinations, so long as the examinations are administered to all 
employees in a nondiscriminatory manner and the results are treated on a 
confidential basis.
    19. Specific acts of Discrimination. Sections 84.15 (recruitment), 
84.16 (compensation), 84.17 (job classification and structure) and 84.18 
(fringe benefits) have been deleted from the regulation as unnecessarily 
duplicative of Sec. 84.11 (discrimination prohibited). The deletion of 
these sections in no way changes the substantive obligations of 
employers subject to this regulation from those set forth in the July 16 
proposed regulation. These deletions bring the regulation closer in form 
to the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation.
    Proposed Sec. 84.18, concerning fringe benefits, had allowed for 
differences in benefits or contributions between handicapped and 
nonhandicapped persons in situations only where such differences could 
be justified on an actuarial basis. Section 84.11 simply bars 
discrimination in providing fringe benefits and does not address the 
issue of actuarial differences. The Department believes that currently 
available data and experience do not demonstrate a basis for 
promulgating a regulation specifically allowing for differences in 
benefits or contributions.

                    subpart c--program accessibility

    In general, subpart C prohibits the exclusion of qualified 
handicapped persons from federally assisted programs or activities 
because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible or unusable.
    20. Existing facilities. Section 84.22 maintains the same standard 
for nondiscrimination in regard to existing facilities as was included 
in the proposed regulation. The section states that a recipient's 
program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, must be readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Paragraphs (a) and (b) 
make clear that a recipient is not required to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to handicapped persons if its program as a whole 
is accessible. Accessibility to the recipient's program or activity may 
be achieved by a number of means, including redesign of equipment, 
reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, and 
making aides available to beneficiaries. In choosing among methods of 
compliance, recipients are required to give priority consideration to 
methods that will be consistent with provision of services in the most 
appropriate integrated setting. Structural changes in existing 
facilities are required only where there is no other feasible way to 
make the recipient's program accessible.
    Under Sec. 84.22, a university does not have to make all of its 
existing classroom buildings accessible to handicapped students if some 
of its buildings are already accessible and if it is possible to 
reschedule or relocate enough classes so as to offer all required 
courses and a reasonable selection of elective courses in accessible 
facilities. If sufficient relocation of classes is not possible using 
existing facilities, enough alterations to ensure program accessibility 
are required. A university may not exclude a handicapped student from a 
specifically requested course offering because it is not offered in an 
accessible location, but it need not make every section of that course 
accessible.
    Commenters representing several institutions of higher education 
have suggested that it would be appropriate for one postsecondary 
institution in a geographical area to be made accessible to handicapped 
persons and for other colleges and universities in that area to 
participate in that school's program, thereby developing an educational 
consortium for the postsecondary education of handicapped students. The 
Department believes that such a consortium, when developed and applied 
only to handicapped persons, would not constitute compliance with Sec. 
84.22, but would discriminate against qualified handicapped persons by 
restricting their choice in selecting institutions of higher education 
and would, therefore, be inconsistent with the basic objectives of the 
statute.
    Nothing in this regulation, however, should be read as prohibiting 
institutions from forming consortia for the benefit of all students. 
Thus, if three colleges decide that it would be cost-efficient for one 
college to offer biology, the second physics, and the third chemistry to 
all students at the three colleges, the arrangement would not violate 
section 504. On the other hand, it would violate the regulation if the 
same institutions set up a consortium under which one college undertook 
to make its biology lab accessible, another its physics lab, and a third 
its chemistry lab, and under which mobility-impaired handicapped 
students (but not other students) were required to attend the particular 
college that is accessible for the desired courses.
    Similarly, while a public school district need not make each of its 
buildings completely accessible, it may not make only one facility or 
part of a facility accessible if the result is to segregate handicapped 
students in a single setting.
    All recipients that proivde health, welfare, or other social 
services may also comply with Sec. 84.22 by delivering services at 
alternate accessible sites or making home visits. Thus, for example, a 
pharmacist might arrange to make home deliveries of drugs. Under revised 
Sec. 84.22(c), small providers of health, welfare, and social services 
(those with fewer than fifteen employees) may refer a beneficiary to an 
accessible provider of the desired service, but only if no means of 
meeting the program accessibility requirement other than a significant 
alteration in existing facilties is available. The referring recipient 
has the responsibility of determining that the other provider is in fact 
accessible and willing to provide the service. The Secretary believes 
this ``last resort'' referral provision is appropriate to avoid 
imposition of additional costs in the health care area, to encourage 
providers to remain in the Medicaid program, and to avoid imposing 
significant costs on small, low-budget providers such as day-care 
centers or foster homes.
    A recent change in the tax law may assist some recipients in meeting 
their obligations under this section. Under section 2122 of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1976, recipients that pay federal income tax are eligible 
to claim a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for architectural and 
transportation modifications made to improve accessibility for 
handicapped persons. Many physicians and dentists, among others, may be 
eligible for this tax deduction. See 42 FR 17870 (April 4, 1977), 
adopting 26 CFR 7.190.
    Several commenters expressed concern about the feasibility of 
compliance with the program accessibility standard. The Secretary 
believes that the standard is flexible enough to permit recipients to 
devise ways to make their programs accessible short of extremely 
expensive or impractical physical

[[Page 358]]

changes in facilities. Accordingly, the section does not allow for 
waivers. The Department is ready at all times to provide technical 
assistance to recipients in meeting their program accessibility 
responsibilities. For this purpose, the Department is establishing a 
special technical assistance unit. Recipients are encouraged to call 
upon the unit staff for advice and guidance both on structural 
modifications and on other ways of meeting the program accessibility 
requirement.
    Paragraph (d) has been amended to require recipients to make all 
nonstructural adjustments necessary for meeting the program 
accessibility standard within sixty days. Only where structural changes 
in facilities are necessary will a recipient be permitted up to three 
years to accomplish program accessibility. It should be emphasized that 
the three-year time period is not a waiting period and that all changes 
must be accomplished as expeditiously as possible. Further, it is the 
Department's belief, after consultation with experts in the field, that 
outside ramps to buildings can be constructed quickly and at relatively 
low cost. Therefore, it will be expected that such structural additions 
will be made promptly to comply with Sec. 84.22(d).
    The regulation continues to provide, as did the proposed version, 
that a recipient planning to achieve program accessibility by making 
structural changes must develop a transition plan for such changes 
within six months of the effective date of the regulation. A number of 
commenters suggested extending that period to one year. The secretary 
believes that such an extension is unnecessary and unwise. Planning for 
any necessary structural changes should be undertaken promptly to ensure 
that they can be completed within the three-year period. The elements of 
the transition plan as required by the regulation remain virtually 
unchanged from the proposal but Sec. 84.22(d) now includes a requirement 
that the recipient make the plan available for public inspection.
    Several commenters expressed concern that the program accessibility 
standard would result in the segregation of handicapped persons in 
educational institutions. The regulation will not be applied to permit 
such a result. See Sec. 84.4(c)(2)(iv), prohibiting unnecessarily 
separate treatment; Sec. 84.35, requiring that students in elementary 
and secondary schools be educated in the most integrated setting 
appropriate to their needs; and new Sec. 84.43(d), applying the same 
standard to postsecondary education.
    We have received some comments from organizations of handicapped 
persons on the subject of requiring, over an extended period of time, a 
barrier-free environment--that is, requiring the removal of all 
architectural barriers in existing facilities. The Department has 
considered these comments but has decided to take no further action at 
this time concerning these suggestions, believing that such action 
should only be considered in light of experience in implementing the 
program accessibility standard.
    21. New construction. Section 84.23 requires that all new 
facilities, as well as alterations that could affect access to and use 
of existing facilities, be designed and constructed in a manner so as to 
make the facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. 
Section 84.23(a) has been amended so that it applies to each newly 
constructed facility if the construction was commenced after the 
effective date of the regulation. The words ``if construction has 
commenced'' will be considered to mean ``if groundbreaking has 
takenplace.'' Thus, a recipient will not be required to alter the design 
of a facility that has progressed beyond groundbreaking prior to the 
effective date of the regulation.
    Paragraph (b) requires certain alterations to conform to the 
requirement of physical accessibility in paragraph (a). If an alteration 
is undertaken to a portion of a building the accessibility of which 
could be improved by the manner in which the alteration is carried out, 
the alteration must be made in that manner. Thus, if a doorway or wall 
is being altered, the door or other wall opening must be made wide 
enough to accommodate wheelchairs. On the other hand, if the alteration 
consists of altering ceilings, the provisions of this section are not 
applicable because this alteration cannot be done in a way that affects 
the accessibility of that portion of the building. The phrase ``to the 
maximum extent feasible'' has been added to allow for the occasional 
case in which the nature of an existing facility is such as to make it 
impractical or prohibitively expensive to renovate the building in a 
manner that results in its being entirely barrier-free. In all such 
cases, however, the alteration should provide the maximum amount of 
physical accessibility feasible.
    As proposed, Sec. 84.23(c) required compliance with the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard on building accessibility 
as the minimum necessary for compliance with the accessibility 
requirement of Sec. 84.23 (a) and (b). The regerence to the ANSI 
standard created some ambiguity, since the standard itself provides for 
waivers where other methods are equally effective in providing 
accessibility to the facility. Moreover, the Secretary does not wish to 
discourage innovation in barrier-free construction by requiring absolute 
adherence to a rigid design standard. Accordingly, Sec. 84.23 (c) has 
been revised to permit departures from particular requirements of the 
ANSI standard where the recipient can demonstrate that equivalent access 
to the facility is provided.
    Section 84.23(d) of the proposed regulation, providing for a limited 
deferral of action

[[Page 359]]

concerning facilities that are subject to section 502 as well as section 
504 of the Act, has been deleted. The Secretary believes that the 
provision is unnecessary and inappropriate to this regulation. The 
Department will, however, seek to coordinate enforcement activities 
under this regulation with those of the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board.

        subpart d--preschool, elementary, and secondary education

    Subpart D sets forth requirements for nondiscrimination in 
preschool, elementary, secondary, and adult education programs and 
activities, including secondary vocational education programs. In this 
context, the term ``adult education'' refers only to those educational 
programs and activities for adults that are operated by elementary and 
secondary schools.
    The provisions of Subpart D apply to state and local educational 
agencies. Although the subpart applies, in general, to both public and 
private education programs and activities that are federally assisted, 
Sec.Sec. 84.32 and 84.33 apply only to public programs and Sec. 84.39 
applies only to private programs; Sec.Sec. 84.35 and 84.36 apply both to 
public programs and to those private programs that include special 
services for handicapped students.
    Subpart B generally conforms to the standards established for the 
education of handicapped persons in Mills v. Board of Education of the 
District of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972), Pennsylvania 
Association for Retarded Children v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 344 
F. Supp. 1257 (E.D. 1971), 343 F. Supp. 279 (E.D. Pa. 1972), and Lebanks 
v. Spears, 60, F.R.D. 135 (E.D. La. 1973), as well as in the Education 
of the Handicapped Act, as amended by Pub. L. 94-142 (the EHA).
    The basic requirements common to those cases, to the EHA, and to 
this regulation are (1) that handicapped persons, regardless of the 
nature or severity of their handicap, be provided a free appropriate 
public education, (2) that handicapped students be educated with 
nonhandicapped students to the maximum extent appropriate to their 
needs, (3) that educational agencies undertake to identify and locate 
all unserved handicapped children, (4) that evaluation procedures be 
improved in order to avoid the inappropriate education that results from 
the misclassification of students, and (5) that procedural safeguard be 
established to enable parents and guardians to influence decisions 
regarding the evaluation and placement of their children. These 
requirements are designed to ensure that no handicapped child is 
excluded from school on the basis of handicap and, if a recipient 
demonstrates that placement in a regular educational setting cannot be 
achieved satisfactorily, that the student is provided with adequate 
alternative services suited to the student's needs without additional 
cost to the student's parents or guardian. Thus, a recipient that 
operates a public school system must either educate handicapped children 
in its regular program or provide such children with an appropriate 
alternative education at public expense.
    It is not the intention of the Department, except in extraordinary 
circumstances, to review the result of individual placement and other 
educational decisions, so long as the school district complies with the 
``process'' requirements of this subpart (concerning identification and 
location, evaluation, and due process procedures). However, the 
Department will place a high priority on investigating cases which may 
involve exclusion of a child from the education system or a pattern or 
practice of discriminatory placements or education.
    22. Location and notification. Section 84.32 requires public schools 
to take steps annually to identify and locate handicapped children who 
are not receiving an education and to publicize to handicapped children 
and their parents the rights and duties established by section 504 and 
this regulation. This section has been shortened without substantive 
change.
    23. Free appropriate public education. Former Sec.Sec. 84.34 (``Free 
education'') and 84.36(a) (``Suitable education'') have been 
consolidated and revised in new Sec. 84.33. Under Sec. 84.34(a), a 
recipient is responsible for providing a free appropriate public 
education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's 
jurisdiction. The word ``in'' encompasses the concepts of both domicile 
and actual residence. If a recipient places a child in a program other 
than its own, it remains financially responsible for the child, whether 
or not the other program is operated by another recipient or educational 
agency. Moreover, a recipient may not place a child in a program that is 
inappropriate or that otherwise violates the requirements of Subpart D. 
And in no case may a recipient refuse to provide services to a 
handicapped child in its jurisdiction because of another person's or 
entity's failure to assume financial responsibility.
    Section 84.33(b) concerns the provision of appropriate educational 
services to handicapped children. To be appropriate, such services must 
be designed to meet handicapped children's individual educational needs 
to the same extent that those of nonhandicapped children are met. An 
appropriate education could consist of education in regular classes, 
education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services, or 
special education and related services. Special education may include 
specially designed instruction in classrooms, at home, or in private or 
public institutions and may be

[[Page 360]]

accompanied by such related services as developmental, corrective, and 
other supportive services (including psychological, counseling, and 
medical diagnostic services). The placement of the child must however, 
be consistent with the requirements of Sec. 84.34 and be suited to his 
or her educational needs.
    The quality of the educational services provided to handicapped 
students must equal that of the services provided to nonhandicapped 
students; thus, handicapped student's teachers must be trained in the 
instruction of persons with the handicap in question and appropriate 
materials and equipment must be available. The Department is aware that 
the supply of adequately trained teachers may, at least at the outset of 
the imposition of this requirement, be insufficient to meet the demand 
of all recipients. This factor will be considered in determining the 
appropriateness of the remedy for noncompliance with this section. A new 
Sec. 84.33(b)(2) has been added, which allows this requirement to be met 
through the full implementation of an individualized education program 
developed in accordance with the standards of the EHA.
    Paragraph (c) of Sec. 84.33 sets forth the specific financial 
obligations of a recipient. If a recipient does not itself provide 
handicapped persons with the requisite services, it must assume the cost 
of any alternate placement. If, however, a recipient offers adequate 
services and if alternate placement is chosen by a student's parent or 
guardian, the recipient need not assume the cost of the outside 
services. (If the parent or guardian believes that his or her child 
cannot be suitably educated in the recipient's program, he or she may 
make use of the procedures established in Sec. 84.36.) Under this 
paragraph, a recipient's obligation extends beyond the provision of 
tuition payments in the case of placement outside the regular program. 
Adequate transportation must also be provided. Recipients must also pay 
for psychological services and those medical services necessary for 
diagnostic and evaluative purposes.
    If the recipient places a student, because of his or her handicap, 
in a program that necessitates his or her being away from home, the 
payments must also cover room and board and nonmedical care (including 
custodial and supervisory care). When residential care is necessitated 
not by the student's handicap but by factors such as the student's home 
conditions, the recipient is not required to pay the cost of room and 
board.
    Two new sentences have been added to paragraph (c)(1) to make clear 
that a recipient's financial obligations need not be met solely through 
its own funds. Recipients may rely on funds from any public or private 
source including insurers and similar third parties.
    The EHA requires a free appropriate education to be provided to 
handicapped children ``no later than September 1, 1978,'' but section 
504 contains no authority for delaying enforcement. To resolve this 
problem, a new paragraph (d) has been added to Sec. 84.33. Section 
84.33(d) requires recipients to achieve full compliance with the free 
appropriate public education requirements of Sec. 84.33 as expeditiously 
as possible, but in no event later than September 1, 1978. The provision 
also makes clear that, as of the effective date of this regulation, no 
recipient may exclude a qualified handicapped child from its educational 
program. This provision against exclusion is consistent with the order 
of providing services set forth in section 612(3) of the EHA, which 
places the highest priority on providing services to handicapped 
children who are not receiving an education.
    24. Educational setting. Section 84.34 prescribes standards for 
educating handicapped persons with nonhandicapped persons to the maximum 
extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person in question. A 
handicapped student may be removed from the regular educational setting 
only where the recipient can show that the needs of the student would, 
on balance, be served by placement in another setting.
    Although under Sec. 84.34, the needs of the handicapped person are 
determinative as to proper placement, it should be stressed that, where 
a handicapped student is so disruptive in a regular classroom that the 
education of other students is significantly impaired, the needs of the 
handicapped child cannot be met in that environment. Therefore, regular 
placement would not be appropriate to his or her needs and would not be 
required by Sec. 84.34.
    Among the factors to be considered in placing a child is the need to 
place the child as close to home as possible. A new sentence has been 
added to paragraph (a) requiring recipients to take this factor into 
account. As pointed out in several comments, the parents' right under 
Sec. 84.36 to challenge the placement of their child extends not only to 
placement in special classes or separate schools but also to placement 
in a distant school and, in particular, to residential placement. An 
equally appropriate educational program may exist closer to home; this 
issue may be raised by the parent or guardian under Sec.Sec. 84.34 and 
84.36.
    New paragraph (b) specified that handicapped children must also be 
provided nonacademic services in as integrated a setting as possible. 
This requirement is especially important for children whose educational 
needs necessitate their being solely with other handicapped children 
during most of each day. To the maximum extent appropriate, children in 
residential settings are

[[Page 361]]

also to be provided opportunities for participation with other children.
    Section 84.34(c) (formerly Sec. 84.38) requires that any facilities 
that are identifiable as being for handicapped students be comparable in 
quality to other facilities of the recipient. A number of comments 
objected to this section on the basis that it encourages the creation 
and maintenance of such facilities. This is not the intent of the 
provision. A separate facility violates section 504 unless it is indeed 
necessary to the provision of an appropriate education to certain 
handicapped students. In those instances in which such facilities are 
necessary (as might be the case, for example, for severely retarded 
persons), this provision requires that the educational services provided 
be comparable to those provided in the facilities of the recipient that 
are not identifiable as being for handicapped persons.
    25. Evaluation and placement. Because the failure to provide 
handicapped persons with an appropriate education is so frequently the 
result of misclassification or misplacement, Sec. 84.33(b)(1) makes 
compliance with its provisions contingent upon adherence to certain 
procedures designed to ensure appropriate classification and placement. 
These procedures, delineated in Sec.Sec. 84.35 and 84.36, are concerned 
with testing and other evaluation methods and with procedural due 
process rights.
    Section 84.35(a) requires that an individual evaluation be conducted 
before any action is taken with respect either to the initial placement 
of a handicapped child in a regular or special education program or to 
any subsequent significant change in that placement. Thus, a full 
reevaluation is not required every time an adjustment in placement is 
made. ``Any action'' includes denials of placement.
    Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 84.35 establishes procedures designed 
to ensure that children are not misclassified, unnecessarily labeled as 
being handicapped, or incorrectly placed because of inappropriate 
selection, administration, or interpretation of evaluation materials. 
This problem has been extensively documented in ``Issues in the 
Classification of Children,'' a report by the Project on Classification 
of Exceptional Children, in which the HHS Interagency Task Force 
participated. The provisions of these paragraphs are aimed primarily at 
abuses in the placement process that result from misuse of, or undue or 
misplaced reliance on, standardized scholastic aptitude tests.
    Paragraph (b) has been shortened but not substantively changed. The 
requirement in former subparagraph (1) that recipients provide and 
administer evaluation materials in the native language of the student 
has been deleted as unnecessary, since the same requirement already 
exists under title VI and is more appropriately covered under that 
statute. Subparagraphs (1) and (2) are, in general, intended to prevent 
misinterpretation and similar misuse of test scores and, in particular, 
to avoid undue reliance on general intelligence tests. Subparagraph (3) 
requires a recipient to administer tests to a student with impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills in whatever manner is necessary to 
avoid distortion of the test results by the impairment. Former 
subparagraph (4) has been deleted as unnecessarily repetitive of the 
other provisions of this paragraph.
    Paragraph (c) requires a recipient to draw upon a variety of sources 
in the evaluation process so that the possibility of error in 
classification is minimized. In particular, it requires that all 
significant factors relating to the learning process, including adaptive 
behavior, be considered. (Adaptive behavior is the effectiveness with 
which the individual meets the standards of personal independence and 
social responsibility expected of his or her age and cultural group.) 
Information from all sources must be documented and considered by a 
group of persons, and the procedure must ensure that the child is placed 
in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    The proposed regulation would have required a complete individual 
reevaluation of the student each year. The Department has concluded that 
it is inappropriate in the section 504 regulation to require full 
reevaluations on such a rigid schedule. Accordingly, Sec. 84.35(c) 
requires periodic reevaluations and specifies that reevaluations in 
accordance with the EHA will constitute compliance. The proposed 
regulation implementing the EHA allows reevaluation at three-year 
intervals except under certain specified circumstances.
    Under Sec. 84.36, a recipient must establish a system of due process 
procedures to be afforded to parents or guardians before the recipient 
takes any action regarding the identification, evaluation, or 
educational placement of a person who, because of handicap, needs or is 
believed to need special education or related services. This section has 
been revised. Because the due process procedures of the EHA, 
incorporated by reference in the proposed section 504 regulation, are 
inappropriate for some recipients not subject to that Act, the section 
now specifies minimum necessary procedures: notice, a right to inspect 
records, an impartial hearing with a right to representation by counsel, 
and a review procedure. The EHA procedures remain one means of meeting 
the regulation's due process requirements, however, and are recommended 
to recipients as a model.
    26. Nonacademic services. Section 84.37 requires a recipient to 
provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in such 
manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal 
opportunity for

[[Page 362]]

participation. Because these services and activities are part of a 
recipient's education program, they must, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 84.34, be provided in the most integrated setting 
appropriate.
    Revised paragraph (c)(2) does permit separation or differentiation 
with respect to the provision of physical education and athletics 
activities, but only if qualified handicapped students are also allowed 
the opportunity to compete for regular teams or participate in regular 
activities. Most handicapped students are able to participate in one or 
more regular physical education and athletics activities. For example, a 
student in a wheelchair can participate in regular archery course, as 
can a deaf student in a wrestling course.
    Finally, the one-year transition period provided in former Sec. 
84.37(a)(3) was deleted in response to the almost unanimous objection of 
commenters to that provision.
    27. Preschool and adult education. Section 84.38 prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of handicap in preschool and adult education 
programs. Former paragraph (b), which emphasized that compensatory 
programs for disadvantaged children are subject to section 504, has been 
deleted as unnecessary, since it is comprehended by paragraph (a).
    28. Private education. Section 84.39 sets forth the requirements 
applicable to recipients that operate private education programs and 
activities. The obligations of these recipients have been changed in two 
significant respects: First, private schools are subject to the 
evaluation and due process provisions of the subpart only if they 
operate special education programs; second, under Sec. 84.39(b), they 
may charge more for providing services to handicapped students than to 
nonhandicapped students to the extent that additional charges can be 
justified by increased costs.
    Paragraph (a) of Sec. 84.39 is intended to make clear that 
recipients that operate private education programs and activities are 
not required to provide an appropriate education to handicapped students 
with special educational needs if the recipient does not offer programs 
designed to meet those needs. Thus, a private school that has no program 
for mentally retarded persons is neither required to admit such a person 
into its program nor to arrange or pay for the provision of the person's 
education in another program. A private recipient without a special 
program for blind students, however, would not be permitted to exclude, 
on the basis of blindness, a blind applicant who is able to participate 
in the regular program with minor adjustments in the manner in which the 
program is normally offered.

                   subpart e--postsecondary education

    Subpart E prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in 
recruitment, admission, and treatment of students in postsecondary 
education programs and activities, including vocational education.
    29. Admission and recruitment. In addition to a general prohibition 
of discrimination on the basis of handicap in Sec. 84.42(a), the 
regulation delineates, in Sec. 84.42(b), specific prohibitions 
concerning the establishment of limitations on admission of handicapped 
students, the use of tests or selection criteria, and preadmission 
inquiry. Several changes have been made in this provision.
    Section 84.42(b) provides that postsecondary educational 
institutions may not use any test or criterion for admission that has a 
disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons unless it has 
been validated as a predictor of academic success and alternate tests or 
criteria with a less disproportionate, adverse effect are shown by the 
Department to be available. There are two significant changes in this 
approach from the July 16 proposed regulation.
    First, many commenters expressed concern that Sec. 84.42(b)(2)(ii) 
could be interpreted to require a ``global search'' for alternate tests 
that do not have a disproportionate, adverse impact on handicapped 
persons. this was not the intent of the provision and, therefore, it has 
been amended to place the burden on the Director of the Office for Civil 
Rights, rather than on the recipient, to identify alternate tests.
    Second, a new paragraph (d), concerning validity studies, has been 
added. Under the proposed regulation, overall success in an education 
program, not just first-year grades, was the criterion against which 
admissions tests were to be validated. This approach has been changed to 
reflect the comment of professional testing services that use of first 
year grades would be less disruptive of present practice and that 
periodic validity studies against overall success in the education 
program would be sufficient check on the reliability of first-year 
grades.
    Section 84.42(b)(3) also requires a recipient to assure itself that 
admissions tests are selected and administered to applicants with 
impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills in such manner as is 
necessary to avoid unfair distortion of test results. Methods have been 
developed for testing the aptitude and achievement of persons who are 
not able to take written tests or even to make the marks required for 
mechanically scored objective tests; in addition, methods for testing 
persons with visual or hearing impairments are available. A recipient, 
under this paragraph, must assure itself that such methods are used with 
respect to the selection and administration of any admissions tests that 
it uses.
    Section 84.42(b)(3)(iii) has been amended to require that admissions 
tests be administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible. 
In this context, on the whole means

[[Page 363]]

that not all of the facilities need be accessibile so long as a 
sufficient number of facilities are available to handicapped persons.
    Revised Sec. 84.42(b)(4) generally prohibits preadmission inquiries 
as to whether an applicant has a handicap. The considerations that led 
to this revision are similar to those underlying the comparable revision 
of Sec. 84.14 on preemployment inquiries. The regulation does, however, 
allow inquiries to be made, after admission but before enrollment, as to 
handicaps that may require accommodation.
    New paragraph (c) parallels the section on preemployment inquiries 
and allows postsecondary institutions to inquire about applicants' 
handicaps before admission, subject to certain safeguards, if the 
purpose of the inquiry is to take remedial action to correct past 
discrimination or to take voluntary action to overcome the limited 
participation of handicapped persons in postsecondary educational 
institutions.
    Proposed Sec. 84.42(c), which would have allowed different 
admissions criteria in certain cases for handicapped persons, was widely 
misinterpreted in comments from both handicapped persons and recipients. 
We have concluded that the section is unnecessary, and it has been 
deleted.
    30. Treatment of students. Section 84.43 contains general provisions 
prohibiting the discriminatory treatment of qualified handicapped 
applicants. Paragraph (b) requires recipients to ensure that equal 
opportunities are provided to its handicapped students in education 
programs and activities that are not operated by the recipient. The 
recipient must be satisfied that the outside education program or 
activity as a whole is nondiscriminatory. For example, a college must 
ensure that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur in 
connection with teaching assignments of student teachers in elementary 
or secondary schools not operated by the college. Under the ``as a 
whole'' wording, the college could continue to use elementary or 
secondary school systems that discriminate if, and only if, the 
college's student teaching program, when viewed in its entirety, offered 
handicapped student teachers the same range and quality of choice in 
student teaching assignments afforded nonhandicapped students.
    Paragraph (c) of this section prohibits a recipient from excluding 
qualified handicapped students from any course, course of study, or 
other part of its education program or activity. This paragraph is 
designed to eliminate the practice of excluding handicapped persons from 
specific courses and from areas of concentration because of factors such 
as ambulatory difficulties of the student or assumptions by the 
recipient that no job would be available in the area in question for a 
person with that handicap.
    New paragraph (d) requires postsecondary institutions to operate 
their programs and activities so that handicapped students are provided 
services in the most integrated setting appropriate. Thus, if a college 
had several elementary physics classes and had moved one such class to 
the first floor of the science building to accommodate students in 
wheelchairs, it would be a violation of this paragraph for the college 
to concentrate handicapped students with no mobility impairments in the 
same class.
    31. Academic adjustments. Paragraph (a) of Sec. 84.44 requires that 
a recipient make certain adjustments to academic requirements and 
practices that discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the 
basis of handicap. This requirement, like its predecessor in the 
proposed regulation, does not obligate an institution to waive course or 
other academic requirements. But such institutions must accommodate 
those requirements to the needs of individual handicapped students. For 
example, an institution might permit an otherwise qualified handicapped 
student who is deaf to substitute an art appreciation or music history 
course for a required course in music appreciation or could modify the 
manner in which the music appreciation course is conducted for the deaf 
student. It shoud be stressed that academic requirements that can be 
demonstrated by the recipient to be essential to its program of 
instruction or to particular degrees need not be changed.
    Paragraph (b) provides that postsecondary institutions may not 
impose rules that have the effect of limiting the participation of 
handicapped students in the education program. Such rules include 
prohibition of tape recorders or braillers in classrooms and dog guides 
in campus buildings. Several recipients expressed concern about allowing 
students to tape record lectures because the professor may later want to 
copyright the lectures. This problem may be solved by requiring students 
to sign agreements that they will not release the tape recording or 
transcription or otherwise hinder the professor's ability to obtain a 
copyright.
    Paragraph (c) of this section, concerning the administration of 
course examinations to students with impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills, parallels the regulation's provisions on admissions 
testing (Sec. 84.42(b)) and will be similarly interpreted.
    Under Sec. 84.44(d), a recipient must ensure that no handicapped 
student is subject to discrimination in the recipient's program because 
of the absence of necessary auxiliary educational aids. Colleges and 
universities expressed concern about the costs of compliance with this 
provision.
    The Department emphasizes that recipients can usually meet this 
obligation by assisting students in using existing resources for 
auxiliary aids such as state vocational

[[Page 364]]

rehabilitation agencies and private charitable organizations. Indeed, 
the Department anticipates that the bulk of auxiliary aids will be paid 
for by state and private agencies, not by colleges or universities. In 
those circumstances where the recipient institution must provide the 
educational auxiliary aid, the institution has flexibility in choosing 
the methods by which the aids will be supplied. For example, some 
universities have used students to work with the institution's 
handicapped students. Other institutions have used existing private 
agencies that tape texts for handicapped students free of charge in 
order to reduce the number of readers needed for visually impaired 
students.
    As long as no handicapped person is excluded from a program because 
of the lack of an appropriate aid, the recipient need not have all such 
aids on hand at all times. Thus, readers need not be available in the 
recipient's library at all times so long as the schedule of times when a 
reader is available is established, is adhered to, and is sufficient. Of 
course, recipients are not required to maintain a complete braille 
library.
    32. Housing. Section 84.45(a) requires postsecondary institutions to 
provide housing to handicapped students at the same cost as they provide 
it to other students and in a convenient, accessible, and comparable 
manner. Commenters, particularly blind persons pointed out that some 
handicapped persons can live in any college housing and need not wait to 
the end of the transition period in Subpart C to be offered the same 
variety and scope of housing accommodations given to nonhandicapped 
persons. The Department concurs with this position and will interpret 
this section accordingly.
    A number of colleges and universities reacted negatively to 
paragraph (b) of this section. It provides that, if a recipient assists 
in making off-campus housing available to its students, it should 
develop and implement procedures to assure itself that off-campus 
housing, as a whole, is available to handicapped students. Since 
postsecondary institutions are presently required to assure themselves 
that off-campus housing is provided in a manner that does not 
discriminate on the basis of sex (Sec. 86.32 of the title IX 
regulation), they may use the procedures developed under title IX in 
order to comply with Sec. 84.45(b). It should be emphasized that not 
every off-campus living accommodation need be made accessible to 
handicapped persons.
    33. Health and insurance. Section 84.46 of the proposed regulation, 
providing that recipients may not discriminate on the basis of handicap 
in the provision of health related services, has been deleted as 
duplicative of the general provisions of Sec. 84.43. This deletion 
represents no change in the obligation of recipients to provide 
nondiscriminatory health and insurance plans. The Department will 
continue to require that nondiscriminatory health services be provided 
to handicapped students. Recipients are not required, however, to 
provide specialized services and aids to handicapped persons in health 
programs. If, for example, a college infirmary treats only simple 
disorders such as cuts, bruises, and colds, its obligation to 
handicapped persons is to treat such disorders for them.
    34. Financial assistance. Section 84.46(a) (formerly Sec. 84.47), 
prohibiting discrimination in providing financial assistance, remains 
substantively the same. It provides that recipients may not provide less 
assistance to or limit the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons 
for such assistance, whether the assistance is provided directly by the 
recipient or by another entity through the recipient's sponsorship. 
Awards that are made under wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments 
in a discriminatory manner are permissible, but only if the overall 
effect of the recipient's provision of financial assistance is not 
discriminatory on the basis of handicap.
    It will not be considered discriminatory to deny, on the basis of 
handicap, an athletic scholarship to a handicapped person if the 
handicap renders the person unable to qualify for the award. For 
example, a student who has a neurological disorder might be denied a 
varsity football scholarship on the basis of his inability to play 
football, but a deaf person could not, on the basis of handicap, be 
denied a scholarship for the school's diving team. The deaf person 
could, however, be denied a scholarship on the basis of comparative 
diving ability.
    Commenters on Sec. 84.46(b), which applies to assistance in 
obtaining outside employment for students, expressed similar concerns to 
those raised under Sec. 84.43(b), concerning cooperative programs. This 
paragraph has been changed in the same manner as Sec. 84.43(b) to 
include the ``as a whole'' concept and will be interpreted in the same 
manner as Sec. 84.43(b).
    35. Nonacademic services. Section 84.47 (formerly Sec. 84.48) 
establishes nondiscrimination standards for physical education and 
athletics counseling and placement services, and social organizations. 
This section sets the same standards as does Sec. 84.38 of Subpart D, 
discussed above, and will be interpreted in a similar fashion.

             subpart f--health, welfare, and social services

    Subpart F applies to recipients that operate health, welfare, and 
social service programs. The Department received fewer comments on this 
subpart than on others.
    Although many commented that Subpart F lacked specificity, these 
commenters provided neither concrete suggestions nor additions. 
Nevertheless, some changes have been made, pursuant to comment, to 
clarify the obligations of recipients in specific areas. In

[[Page 365]]

addition, in an effort to reduce duplication in the regulation, the 
section governing recipients providing health services (proposed Sec. 
84.52) has been consolidated with the section regulating providers of 
welfare and social services (proposed Sec. 84.53). Since the separate 
provisions that appeared in the proposed regulation were almost 
identical, no substantive change should be inferred from their 
consolidation.
    Several commenters asked whether Subpart F applies to vocational 
rehabilitation agencies whose purpose is to assist in the rehabilitation 
of handicapped persons. To the extent that such agencies receive 
financial assistance from the Department, they are covered by Subpart F 
and all other relevant subparts of the regulation. Nothing in this 
regulation, however, precludes such agencies from servicing only 
handicapped persons. Indeed, Sec. 84.4(c) permits recipients to offer 
services or benefits that are limited by federal law to handicapped 
persons or classes of handicapped persons.
    Many comments suggested requiring state health, welfare, and social 
service agencies to take an active role in the enforcement of section 
504 with regard to local health and social service providers. The 
Department believes that the possibility for federal-state cooperation 
in the administration and enforcement of section 504 warrants further 
consideration. Moreover, the Department will rely largely on state 
Medicaid agencies, as it has under title VI, for monitoring compliance 
by individual Medicaid providers.
    A number of comments also discussed whether section 504 should be 
read to require payment of compensation to institutionalized handicapped 
patients who perform services for the institution in which they reside. 
The Department of Labor has recently issued a proposed regulation under 
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that covers the question of 
compensation for institutionalized persons, 42 FR 15224 (March 18, 
1977). This Department will seek information and comment from the 
Department of Labor concerning that agency's experience administering 
the FLSA regulation.
    36. Health, welfare, and other social service providers. As already 
noted, Sec. 84.53 has been combined with proposed Sec. 84.53 into a 
single section covering health, welfare, and other social services. 
Section 84.52(a) has been expanded in several respects. The addition of 
new paragraph (a)(2) is intended to make clear the basic requirement of 
equal opportunity to receive benefits or services in the health, 
welfare, and social service areas. The paragraph parallels Sec.Sec. 
84.4(b)(ii) and 84.43(b). New paragraph (a)(3) requires the provision of 
effective benefits or services, as defined in Sec. 84.4(b)(2) (i.e., 
benefits or services which ``afford handicapped persons equal 
opportunity to obtain the same result (or) to gain the same benefit * * 
*'').
    Section 84.52(a) also includes provisions concerning the limitation 
of benefits or services to handicapped persons and the subjection of 
handicapped persons to different eligibility standards. (These 
provisions were previously included in the welfare recipient section 
(Sec. 84.53(a)).) One common misconception about the regulation is that 
it would require specialized hospitals and other health care providers 
to treat all handicapped persons. The regulation makes no such 
requirement. Thus, a burn treatment center need not provide other types 
of medical treatment to handicapped persons unless it provides such 
medical services to nonhandicapped persons. It could not, however, 
refuse to treat the burns of a deaf person because of his or her 
deafness.
    Commenters had raised the question of whether the prohibition 
against different standards of eligibility might preclude recipients 
from providing special services to handicapped persons or classes of 
handicapped persons. The regulation will not be so interpreted, and the 
specific section in question has been eliminated. Section 84.4(c) makes 
clear that special programs for handicapped persons are permitted.
    A new paragraph (a)(5) concerning the provision of different or 
separate services or benefits has been added. This provision prohibits 
such treatment unless necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons 
with benefits and services that are as effective as those provided to 
others.
    Section 84.52(a)(2) of the proposed regulation has been omitted as 
duplicative of revised Sec. 84.22 (b) and (c) in Subpart C. As discussed 
above, these sections permit health care providers to arrange to meet 
patients in accessible facilities and to make referrals in carefully 
limited circumstances.
    Section 84.52(a)(3) of the proposed regulation has been redesignated 
Sec. 84.52(b) and has been amended to cover written material concerning 
waivers of rights or consent to treatment as well as general notices 
concerning health benefits or services. The section requires the 
recipient to ensure that qualified handicapped persons are not denied 
effective notice because of their handicap. For example, recipients 
could use several different types of notice in order to reach persons 
with impaired vision or hearing, such as brailled messages, radio spots, 
and tacticle devices on cards or envelopes to inform blind persons of 
the need to call the recipient for further information.
    Sections 84.52(a)(4), 84.52(a)(5), and 84.52(b) have been omitted 
from the regulation as unnecessary. They are clearly comprehended by the 
more general sections banning discrimination.
    Section 84.52(c) is a new section requiring recipient hospitals to 
establish a procedure for effective communication with persons

[[Page 366]]

with impaired hearing for the purpose of providing emergency health 
care. Although it would be appropriate for a hospital to fulfill its 
responsibilities under this section by having a full-time interpreter 
for the deaf on staff, there may be other means of accomplishing the 
desired result of assuring that some means of communication is 
immediately available for deaf persons needing emergency treatment.
    Section 84.52(d), also a new provision, requires recipients with 
fifteen or more employees to provide appropriate auxiliary aids for 
persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills. Further, the 
Director may require a small provider to furnish auxiliary aids where 
the provision of aids would not adversely affect the ability of the 
recipient to provide its health benefits or service. Thus although a 
small nonprofit neighborhood clinic might not be obligated to have 
available an interpreter for deaf persons, the Director may require 
provision of such aids as may be reasonably available to ensure that 
qualified handicapped persons are not denied appropriate benefits or 
services because of their handicaps.
    37. Treatment of Drug Addicts and Alcoholics. Section 84.53 is a new 
section that prohibits discrimination in the treatment and admission of 
drug and alcohol addicts to hospitals and outpatient facilities. This 
section is included pursuant to section 407, Pub. L. 92--255, the Drug 
Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (21 U.S.C. 1174), as amended, and 
section 321, Public Law 91-616, the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (42 
U.S.C. 4581), as amended, and section 321, Public Law 93-282. Section 
504 itself also prohibits such discriminatory treatment and, in 
addition, prohibits similar discriminatory treatment by other types of 
health providers. Section 84.53 prohibits discrimination against drug 
abusers by operators of outpatient facilities, despite the fact that 
section 407 pertains only to hospitals, because of the broader 
application of section 504. This provision does not mean that all 
hospitals and outpatient facilities must treat drug addiction and 
alcoholism. It simply means, for example, that a cancer clinic may not 
refuse to treat cancer patients simply because they are also alcoholics.
    38. Education of institutionalized persons. The regulation retains 
Sec. 84.54 of the proposed regulation that requires that an appropriate 
education be provided to qualified handicapped persons who are confined 
to residential institutions or day care centers.

                          subpart g--procedures

    In Sec. 84.61, the Secretary has adopted the title VI complaint and 
enforcement procedures for use in implementing section 504 until such 
time as they are superseded by the issuance of a consolidated procedural 
regulation applicable to all of the civil rights statutes and executive 
orders administered by the Department.

  Appendix B to Part 84--Guidelines for Eliminating Discrimination and 
 Denial of Services on the Basis of Race, Color, National Origin, Sex, 
              and Handicap in Vocational Education Programs

    Note: For the text of these guidelines, see 45 CFR Part 80, Appendix 
B.

[44 FR 17168, Mar. 21, 1979]

     Appendix C to Part 84--Guidelines Relating to Health Care for 
                           Handicapped Infants

    (a) Interpretative guidelines relating to the applicability of this 
part to health care for handicapped infants. The following are 
interpretative guidelines of the Department set forth here to assist 
recipients and the public in understanding the Department's 
interpretation of section 504 and the regulations contained in this part 
as applied to matters concerning health care for handicapped infants. 
These interpretative guidelines are illustrative; they do not 
independently establish rules of conduct.
    (1) With respect to programs and activities receiving Federal 
financial assistance, health care providers may not, solely on the basis 
of present or anticipated physical or mental impairments of an infant, 
withhold treatment or nourishment from the infant who, in spite of such 
impairments, will medically benefit from the treatment or nourishment.
    (2) Futile treatment or treatment that will do no more than 
temporarily prolong the act of dying of a terminally ill infant is not 
considered treatment that will medically benefit the infant.
    (3) In determining whether certain possible treatments will be 
medically beneficial to an infant, reasonable medical judgments in 
selecting among alternative courses of treatment will be respected.
    (4) Section 504 and the provisions of this part are not applicable 
to parents (who are not recipients of Federal financial assistance). 
However, each recipient health care provider must in all aspects of its 
health care programs receiving Federal financial assistance provide 
health care and related services in a manner consistent with the 
requirements of section 504 and this part. Such aspects includes 
decisions on whether to report, as required by State law or otherwise, 
to the appropriate child protective services agency a suspected instance 
of medical neglect of a child, or to take other action to seek review or 
parental decisions to withhold consent for medically indicated 
treatment.

[[Page 367]]

Whenever parents make a decision to withhold consent for medically 
beneficial treatment or nourishment, such recipient providers may not, 
solely on the basis of the infant's present or anticipated future mental 
or physical impairments, fail to follow applicable procedures on 
reporting such incidents to the child protective services agency or to 
seek judicial review.
    (5) The following are examples of applying these interpretative 
guidelines. These examples are stated in the context of decisions made 
by recipient health care providers. Were these decisions made by 
parents, the guideline stated in section (a)(4) would apply. These 
examples assume no facts or complications other than those stated. 
Because every case must be examined on its individual facts, these are 
merely illustrative examples to assist in understanding the framework 
for applying the nondiscrimination requirements of section 504 and this 
part.
    (i) Withholding of medically beneficial surgery to correct an 
intestinal obstruction in an infant with Down's Syndrome when the 
withholding is based upon the anticipated future mental retardation of 
the infant and there are no medical contraindications to the surgery 
that would otherwise justify withholding the surgery would constitute a 
discriminatory act, violative of section 504.
    (ii) Withholding of treatment for medically correctable physical 
anomalies in children born with spina bifida when such denial is based 
on anticipated mental impairment paralysis or incontinence of the 
infant, rather than on reasonable medical judgments that treatment would 
be futile, too unlikely of success given complications in the particular 
case, or otherwise not of medical benefit to the infant, would 
constitute a discriminatory act, violative of section 504.
    (iii) Withholding of medical treatment for an infant born with 
anencephaly, who will inevitably die within a short period of time, 
would not constitute a discriminatory act because the treatment would be 
futile and do no more than temporarily prolong the act of dying.
    (iv) Withholding of certain potential treatments from a severely 
premature and low birth weight infant on the grounds of reasonable 
medical judgments concerning the improbability of success or risks of 
potential harm to the infant would not violate section 504.
    (b) Guidelines for HHS investigations relating to health care for 
handicapped infants. The following are guidelines of the Department in 
conducting investigations relating to health care for handicapped 
infants. They are set forth here to assist recipients and the public in 
understanding applicable investigative procedures. These guidelines do 
not establish rules of conduct, create or affect legally enforceable 
rights of any person, or modify existing rights, authorities or 
responsibilities pursuant to this part. These guidelines reflect the 
Department's recognition of the special circumstances presented in 
connection with complaints of suspected life-threatening noncompliance 
with this part involving health care for handicapped infants. These 
guidelines do not apply to other investigations pursuant to this part, 
or other civil rights statutes and rules. Deviations from these 
guidelines may occur when, in the judgment of the responsible Department 
official, other action is necessary to protect the life or health of a 
handicapped infant.
    (1) Unless impracticable, whenever the Department receives a 
complaint of suspected life-threatening noncompliance with this part in 
connection with health care for a handicapped infant in a program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, HHS will immediately 
conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter by initiating telephone 
contact with the recipient hospital to obtain information relating to 
the condition and treatment of the infant who is the subject of the 
complaint. The preliminary inquiry, which may include additional contact 
with the complainant and a requirement that pertinent records be 
provided to the Department, will generally be completed within 24 hours 
(or sooner if indicated) after receipt of the complaint.
    (2) Unless impracticable, whenever a recipient hospital has an 
Infant Care Review Committee, established and operated substantially in 
accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 84.55(f), the Department will, 
as part of its preliminary inquiry, solicit the information available 
to, and the analysis and recommendations of, the ICRC. Unless, in the 
judgment of the responsible Department official, other action is 
necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped infant, prior 
to initiating an on-site investigation, the Department will await 
receipt of this information from the ICRC for 24 hours (or less if 
indicated) after receipt of the complaint. The Department may require a 
subsequent written report of the ICRC's findings, accompanied by 
pertinent records and documentation.
    (3) On the basis of the information obtained during preliminary 
inquiry, including information provided by the hospital (including the 
hospital's ICRC, if any), information provided by the complainant, and 
all other information obtained, the Department will determine whether 
there is a need for an on-site investigation of the complaint. Whenever 
the Department determines that doubt remains that the recipient hospital 
or some other recipient is in compliance with this part or additional 
documentation is desired to substantiate a conclusion, the Department 
will initiate an on-site investigation or take some other appropriate 
action. Unless impracticable, prior to initiating an on-site

[[Page 368]]

investigation, the Department's medical consultant (referred to in 
paragraph 6) will contact the hospital's ICRC or appropriate medical 
personnel of the recipient hospital.
    (4) In conducting on-site investigations, when a recipient hospital 
has an ICRC established and operated substantially in accordance with 
the provisions of 45 CFR 84.55(f), the investigation will begin with, or 
include at the earliest practicable time, a meeting with the ICRC or its 
designees. In all on-site investigations, the Department will make every 
effort to minimize any potential inconvenience or disruption, 
accommodate the schedules of health care professionals and avoid making 
medical records unavailable. The Department will also seek to coordinate 
its investigation with any related investigations by the state child 
protective services agency so as to minimize potential disruption.
    (5) It is the policy of the Department to make no comment to the 
public or media regarding the substance of a pending preliminary inquiry 
or investigation.
    (6) The Department will obtain the assistance of a qualified medical 
consultant to evaluate the medical information (including medical 
records) obtained in the course of a preliminary inquiry or 
investigation. The name, title and telephone number of the Department's 
medical consultant will be made available to the recipient hospital. The 
Department's medical consultant will, if appropriate, contact medical 
personnel of the recipient hospital in connection with the preliminary 
inquiry, investigation or medical consultant's evaluation. To the extent 
practicable, the medical consultant will be a specialist with respect to 
the condition of the infant who is the subject of the preliminary 
inquiry or investigation. The medical consultant may be an employee of 
the Department or another person who has agreed to serve, with or 
without compensation, in that capacity.
    (7) The Department will advise the recipient hospital of its 
conclusions as soon as possible following the completion of a 
preliminary inquiry or investigation. Whenever final administrative 
findings following an investigation of a complaint of suspected life-
threatening noncompliance cannot be made promptly, the Department will 
seek to notify the recipient and the complainant of the Department's 
decision on whether the matter will be immediately referred to the 
Department of Justice pursuant to 45 CFR 80.8.
    (8) Except as necessary to determine or effect compliance, the 
Department will (i) in conducting preliminary inquiries and 
investigations, permit information provided by the recipient hospital to 
the Department to be furnished without names or other identifying 
information relating to the infant and the infant's family; and (ii) to 
the extent permitted by law, safeguard the confidentiality of 
information obtained.

Sec. 85.31  Employment.

    No qualified individuals with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (9 U.S.C.

[[Page 372]]

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 9 CFR part 1613, shall apply 
to employment in federally conducted programs and activities.


<R05>
Sec.Sec. 85.32-85.40  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 85.41  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 85.42, no qualified individual 
with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible 
to or unusable by such persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded 
from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under 
any program or activity conducted by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 85.42  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 85.42(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity in question, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods. (1) The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in 
making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility 
requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations 
implementing it.
    (2) In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements 
of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that 
offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in 
the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within 60 days of the 
effective date of this part except where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken; such changes shall be made within three years 
of the effective date of this part, but, in any event, as expeditiously 
as possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities must be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, and it 
is not expected that such changes can be completed within six months, 
the agency shall develop, within six months of the effective date of 
this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to 
complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or 
organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in 
the development of the transition plan by

[[Page 373]]

submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition 
plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a 
minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for the implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 85.43  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, or on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607 apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec.Sec. 85.44-85.50  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 85.51  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, program or activity conducted 
by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 85.51 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity in 
question and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons 
for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

to obtain pre-complaint counseling within 30 days of the alleged 
discriminatory act, and to file complaints within 15 days of the close 
of counseling. Responsibility for the acceptance, investigation, and the 
rendering of decisions with respect to employment complaints is vested 
in the Assistant Secretary for Personnel Administration.
    (d) OCR shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for 
which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 
180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. OCR may extend this time 
for good cause.
    (e) If OCR receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Federal 
government entity.
    (f) OCR shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers 
Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building 
or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which

Director/Special Assistant. Decisions on such appeals shall not be heard 
by the person who made the initial decision.
    (j) OCR shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal 
within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If OCR determines that it 
needs additional information from the complainant, it shall have 60 days 
from the date it receives the additional information to make its 
determination on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in (g) and (j) above may be extended with 
the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

    Editorial Note: At the request of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, the ``Section-by-Section Analysis'' portion of the preamble of 
the document published at 53 FR 25595, July 8, 1988, as corrected at 53 
FR 26559, July 13, 1988, follows:

   Section-by-Section Analysis of Regulation and Response to Comments

    Where no discussion of comments follows the analysis of a section, 
no comments have been received thereon.

                          Section 85.1 Purpose.

    Section 85.1 states the purpose of the rule, which is to effectuate 
section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and 
Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by Executive 
agencies or the United States Postal Service.

                        Section 85.2 Application.

    The proposed regulation covers all programs and activities conducted 
by the Department of Health and Human Services (``HHS'' or the 
``agency'').
    This includes the following components:

The Office of the Secretary
    Office of the Under Secretary
    Office of the Deputy Under Secretary
    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs
    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation
    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation
    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget
    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Peronnel Administration
    Office of the General Counsel
    Office of Inspector General
    Office for Civil Rights
    Office of Consumer Affairs
Office of Human Development Services
    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services
    Administration on Aging
    Administration for Children, Youth and Families
    Administration for Native Americans
    Administration on Developmental Disabilities
Public Health Service
    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health
    Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
    Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration
    Centers for Disease Control
    Food and Drug Administration
    Health Resources and Services Administration
    Indian Health Service
    National Institutes of Health
Health Care Financing Administration
Social Security Administration
Family Support Administration.

    Under this section, a federally conducted program or activity is, in 
simple terms, anything a Federal agency does. Aside from employment, 
there are two major categories of federally conducted programs or 
activities covered by this regulation: those involving general public 
contact as part of ongoing agency operations, and those directly 
administered by the agency for program beneficiaries and participants. 
Activities in the first category include communication with the public 
(telephone contacts, office walk-ins, or interviews) and the public's 
use of the agency's facilities. Activities in the second category 
include programs that provide Federal services or benefits. This 
regulation does not, however, apply to programs or activities conducted 
outside the United States that do not involve individuals with handicaps 
in the United States.
    The major programs subject to this regulation are listed below. Each 
of the components listed above occupies facilities which the public may 
have occasion to visit, engages in written and oral communication with 
the public, and hires Federal employees. In addition, some components 
operate programs which involve extensive public use, as summarized 
below:

    Office of the Secretary--No major operating programs or activities 
conducted directly by the Federal government.
    Office of Human Development Services--No major operating programs or 
activities conducted directly by the Federal government.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Financial assistance programs conducted through grants to States 
and other recipients are covered by the section 504 rule for federally 
assisted programs at 45 CFR Part 84.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Public Health Service--Directly operated programs include the Indian 
Health Service, and intramural research conducted by the National 
Institutes of Health.\1\
    Health Care Financing Administration--Directly operates the Medicare 
program.\1\

[[Page 376]]

    Social Security Administration--Directly operates the Old Age, 
Survivors, and Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income 
for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled programs.
    Family Support Administration--No major operating programs or 
activities conducted directly by the Federal government.\1\

    One commenter urged the inclusion of a program operated by one 
component of the Office of the Secretary, and for a list of all programs 
and activities to be appended to the regulation. In light of the fact 
that all programs and activities are covered, that a comprehensive list 
of all programs would be very lengthy, and that such a list would have 
to be amended frequently as new programs are enacted and existing 
programs expire, the above list appears to be sufficient.

                        Section 85.3 Definitions.

    Agency. For purposes of this part agency means the Department of 
Health and Human Services or any component part of the Department of 
Health and Human Services that conducts a program or activity covered by 
this part. Component agency means any such component part.
    Assistant Attorney General. Assistant Attorney General refers to the 
Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States 
Department of Justice.
    Auxiliary aids. Auxiliary aids means services or devices that enable 
persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an 
equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the 
agency's programs or activities. The definition provides examples of 
commonly used auxiliary aids. Although auxiliary aids are required 
explicitly only by Sec. 85.51(a)(1), they may also be necessary to meet 
other requirements of this regulation.
    Two commenters suggested expanding the definition of auxiliary aids 
and one of them further suggested re-naming auxiliary aids to read aids 
for reasonable accommodation and specifically include the services of 
attendants.
    The items set out in Sec. 85.3 are clearly described as examples, 
and are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list. By giving 
examples rather than by including a list, other aids can be used, and, 
in appropriate cases, required, without amending the regulation. In 
certain instances, the services of attendants may indeed be appropriate; 
in those instances, they will fall under the definition in Sec. 85.3. 
Therefore, there is no need to change the text of the regulations.
    Complete complaint. Complete complaint is defined to include all of 
the information necessary to enable the agency to investigate the 
complaint. The definition is necessary, because the 180 day period for 
the agency's investigation (see Sec. 85.61(g)) begins when the agency 
receives a complete complaint.
    Two commenters stated their belief that the definition of complete 
complaint is too restrictive, and urged language which would give the 
complainant specific information as to what additional information is 
needed, and a further 30 days to submit such information, failing which 
the complaint would be dismissed without prejudice, and the complainant 
would be so informed.
    Procedures similar to this suggestion are currently in place, and 
complainants will be given reasonable opportunities to complete the 
information submitted. There appears to be no need to spell these 
procedures out in the regulation.
    Facility. The definition of facility is similar to that in the 
section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28 
CFR 41.3(f)), except that the term rolling stock or other conveyances 
has been added and the phrase or interest in such property has been 
deleted because the term facility, as used in this part, refers to 
structures and not to intangible property rights. It should, however, be 
noted that this part applies to all programs and activities conducted by 
the agency regardless of whether the facility in which they are 
conducted is owned, leased, or used on some other basis by the agency. 
The term facility is used in Sec.Sec. 85.41, 85.42, and 85.61(f).
    One commenter proposed not to delete the phrase or interest in such 
property. As previously stated, the phrase or interest in such property 
has been deleted because the term facility, as used in this part, refers 
to structures and not to intangible property rights.
    Individual with Handicaps. The definition of individual with 
handicaps is identical to the definition of handicapped person appearing 
in the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted 
programs (28 CFR 41.31), and the HHS regulation for federally assisted 
programs (45 CFR 84.3(j)). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation 
Act Amendments of 1986 changed the statutory term handicapped individual 
to individual with handicaps, the legislative history of the amendment 
indicates that no substantive change was intended. Thus, although the 
term has been changed in this regulation to be consistent with the 
statute as amended, the definition is unchanged. In particular, although 
the term as revised refers to handicaps in the plural, it does not 
exclude persons who have only one handicap.
    One commenter suggested that we add sensory to the phrase physical 
or mental impairment. Since the definition set out in Sec. 85.3 
specifically includes the sense organs among the body systems whose 
impairment constitutes a handicap, we have not found it necessary to 
amend the regulation.

[[Page 377]]

    OCR. OCR means the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of 
Health and Human Services.
    OCR Director/Special Assistant means the Director of the Office for 
Civil Rights, who serves concurrently as the Special Assistant to the 
Secretary for Civil Rights, or a designee of the OCR Director/Special 
Assistant.
    Qualified individual with handicaps. The definition of qualified 
individual with handicaps is a revised version of the definition of 
qualified handicapped person appearing in the section 504 coordination 
regulation for federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32) and the HHS 
section 504 regulation for federally assisted programs (45 CFR 84.3(k)).
    Paragraph (1) is an adaptation of existing definitions of qualified 
handicapped person for purposes of federally assisted preschool, 
elementary, and secondary education programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR 
84.3(k)(2)). It provides that an individual with handicaps is qualified 
for preschool, elementary, or secondary education programs conducted by 
the agency, if he or she is a member of a class of persons otherwise 
entitled by statute, regulation, or agency policy to receive these 
services from the agency. In other words, an individual with handicaps 
is qualified if, considering all factors other than the handicapping 
condition, he or she is entitled to receive educational services from 
the agency.
    Paragraph (2) deviates from existing regulations for federally 
assisted programs because of intervening court decisions. It defines 
qualified individual with handicaps with regard to any program other 
than those covered by paragraph (1) under which a person is required to 
perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment. In such 
programs, a qualified individual with handicaps is one who can achieve 
the purpose of the program without modifications in the program that the 
agency can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in its 
nature. This definition reflects the decision of the Supreme Court in 
Davis.
    In that case, the Court ruled that a hearing-impaired applicant to a 
nursing school was not a qualified handicapped person because her 
hearing impairment would prevent her from participating in the clinical 
training portion of the program. The Court found that, if the program 
were modified so as to enable the respondent to participate (by 
exempting her from the clinical training requirements), she would not 
receive even a rough equivalent of the training a nursing program 
normally gives. Id. at 410. It also found that the purpose of [the] 
program was to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in 
all customary ways, Id. at 413, and that the respondent would be unable, 
because of her hearing impairment, to perform some functions expected of 
a registered nurse. It, therefore, concluded that the school was not 
required by section 504 to make such modifications that would result in 
a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program. Id. at 410.
    We have incorporated the Court's language in the definition of 
qualified individual with handicaps in order to make clear that such a 
person must be able to participate in the program offered by the agency. 
The agency is required to make modifications in order to enable an 
applicant with handicaps to participate, but is not required to offer a 
program of a fundamentally different nature. The test is whether, with 
appropriate modifications, the applicant can achieve the purpose of the 
program offered, not whether the applicant could benefit or obtain 
results from some other program that the agency does not offer. Although 
the revised definition allows exclusion of some individuals with 
handicaps from some programs, it requires that an individual with 
handicaps who is capable of achieving the purpose of the program must be 
accommodated, provided that the modifications do not fundamentally alter 
the purpose of the program.
    One commenter proposed inserting the second sentence from the above 
paragraph into the regulatory text. We believe that the use of this 
language in the preamble is sufficient.
    Another commenter commended HHS for the discussion of Davis, and the 
cases interpreting the Davis decision, in order to explain why the 
language of this part does not precisely track that of the regulations 
concerning federally assisted recipients (45 CFR Part 84). Two other 
commenters stated their view that incorporating Davis and Alexander into 
the regulation was unduly restrictive, and that the differences between 
this part and Part 84 would result in holding HHS to a lesser standard 
than HHS holds recipients of Federal financial assistance.
    We believe that the Supreme Court's decision in Davis as well as the 
subsequent lower court decisions following Davis interpret section 504 
and that it is necessary to reflect those decisions in the Department's 
regulation. The suggested changes are therefore not being adopted.
    The agency has the burden of demonstrating that a proposed 
modification would constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of 
its program or activity. Furthermore, in demonstrating that a 
modification would result in such an alteration, the agency must follow 
the procedures established in Sec.Sec. 85.42(a) and 85.51(d), which are 
discussed below, for demonstrating that an action would result in undue 
financial and administrative burdens to the agency. That is, the 
decision must be made by the agency head or his or her designee in 
writing after consideration of all resources which are legally available 
to the agency for the purpose, and must be accompanied by an explanation 
of the reasons for the decision. If the agency

[[Page 378]]

head determines that an action would result in a fundamental alteration, 
the agency must consider options that would enable the individual with 
handicaps to achieve the purpose of the program but would not result in 
such an alteration.
    Two commenters suggested that the total resources of the agency be 
considered in determining undue burden. Because many Department funds 
are earmarked for specific purposes and are therefore unavailable for 
use elsewhere, the entire agency budget is not an appropriate 
consideration.
    For programs or activities which do not fall under either of the 
first two paragraphs, paragraph (3) adopts the existing definition of 
qualified handicapped person with respect to services (28 CFR 41.32(b)) 
in the coordination regulation for programs receiving Federal financial 
assistance. Under this definition, a qualified individual with handicaps 
is an individual with handicaps who meets the essential eligibility 
requirements for participation in the program or activity.
    Paragraph (4) explains that qualified individual with handicaps 
means qualified handicapped person as that term is defined for purposes 
of employment in the EEOC regulation at 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is 
made applicable to this part by Sec. 85.31. Nothing in this part changes 
existing regulations pertaining to employment.
    One commenter proposed using the general section 504 definition of 
qualified handicapped person in employment cases rather than the 
definition of the EEOC regulation. The definition has been supplied by 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which coordinates all 
employment discrimination matters throughout the government. It is also 
the Department's view that it is important to have a uniform definition 
of what constitutes employment discrimination throughout the Federal 
government.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services or the Secretary's designee.
    Section 504. This definition makes clear that, as used in this part, 
section 504 applies only to programs or activities conducted by the 
agency itself and not to programs or activities to which it provides 
Federal financial assistance.

                     Section 85.11 Self-evaluation.

    The agency shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with 
section 504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. 
The self-evaluation requirement is present in the existing section 504 
coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federal 
financial assistance (28 CFR 41.5(b)(2)) and the HHS regulations for 
federally assisted programs (45 CFR 84.6(k)). Experience has 
demonstrated the self-evaluation process to be a valuable means of 
establishing a working relationship with individuals with handicaps that 
promotes both effective and efficient implementation of section 504.
    One commenter stated that a three-year retention period is 
insufficient, and proposed that self-evaluations be kept indefinitely. 
The regulation requires the self-evaluation to be kept for a minimum of 
three years, but does not include a maximum. It is expected that the 
self-evaluation will be retained for the period provided in current 
document retention policies.
    Another commenter proposed that copies of the self-evaluation be 
made available for copying as well as for public inspection. This 
proposal has been adopted.
    A further commenter proposed the inclusion of provisions for 
assurances, transition plans and specific modification requirements. We 
believe that while assurances are appropriate--and can be specifically 
enforced--in section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs or 
activities, all of the entities involved in this part are under the 
control of the Secretary, who can issue the necessary directives; 
assurances are therefore not required.
    The final rule provides for participation in the self-evaluation 
process by individuals with handicaps or organizations representing 
individuals with handicaps by submitting comments, which may include the 
development of transition plans. It is expected that component agencies 
will consult with individuals with handicaps among their own staff in 
the course of preparing self-evaluations.
    Because modification requirements are intended to address any 
potential problems in the agency's programs or activities, they are not 
specified in the regulation.

                          Section 85.12 Notice.

    Section 85.12 requires the agency to disseminate sufficient 
information to employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and 
other interested persons to apprise them of the rights and protections 
afforded by section 504 and this part. Methods of providing this 
information include, for example, the publication of information in 
handbooks, manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed to the public to 
describe the agency's programs and activities or in connection with 
recruitment; the display of informative posters in service centers and 
other public places; or the broadcasting of information by television or 
radio.
    One commenter suggested the inclusion of a reference to recruitment 
materials in the above examples. Such a reference has been included.

[[Page 379]]

       Section 85.21 General prohibitions against discrimination.

    Section 85.21 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the 
section 504 coordination regulation for programs and activities 
receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.51).
    Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. 
The remaining paragraphs in Sec. 85.21 establish the general principles 
for analyzing whether any particular action of the agency violates this 
mandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for the 
remaining sections of the part. If the agency violates a provision in 
any of the subsequent sections, it will also violate one of the general 
prohibitions found in Sec. 85.21. When there is no applicable subsequent 
provision, the general prohibitions stated in this section apply.
    Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of 
individuals with handicaps. The agency may not refuse to provide an 
individual with handicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or 
benefit from its program simply because the person is handicapped. Such 
blatantly exclusionary practices could result from the use of 
irrebuttable presumptions that absolutely exclude certain classes of 
disabled persons (e.g., epileptics, hearing-impaired persons, persons 
with heart ailments) from participation in programs or activities 
without regard to an individual's actual ability to participate. Use of 
an irrebuttable presumption is permissible only when in all cases a 
physical condition by its very nature would prevent an individual from 
meeting the essential eligibility requirements for participation in the 
activity in question. It would be permissible, therefore, to exclude 
without an individual evaluation all persons who are blind in both eyes 
from eligibility for a license to operate a commercial vehicle in 
interstate commerce; but it may not be permissible to automatically 
disqualify all those who are blind in just one eye.
    In addition, section 504 prohibits more than just the most obvious 
denials of equal treatment. It is not enough to admit persons in 
wheelchairs to a program if the facilities in which the program is 
conducted are inaccessible. Paragraph (b)(1)(iii), therefore, requires 
that the opportunity to participate or benefit afforded to an individual 
with handicaps be as effective as that afforded to others. The later 
sections on program accessibility (Sec.Sec. 85.41-43) and communication 
(Sec. 85.51) are specific applications of this principle.
    Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the agency administer its 
programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to 
the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps, paragraph (b)(1)(iv), 
in conjunction with paragraph (d), permits the agency to develop 
separate or different aids, benefits, or services when necessary to 
provide individuals with handicaps with an equal opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the agency's programs or activities. 
Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) requires that different or separate aids, benefits, 
or services be provided only when necessary to ensure that the aids, 
benefits, or services are as effective as those provided to others. Even 
when separate or different aids, benefits or services would be more 
effective, paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualified individual with 
handicaps still has the right to choose to participate in the program 
that is not designed to accommodate individuals with handicaps.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the agency from denying a qualified 
individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of 
a planning or advisory board.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the agency from limiting a qualified 
individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, 
advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, 
or service.
    Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the agency from utilizing criteria or 
methods of administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to 
the agency's programs or activities. The phrase criteria or methods of 
administration refers to official written agency policies, as well as 
the actual practices of the agency. This paragraph prohibits both 
blatantly exclusionary policies or practices and nonessential policies 
and practices that are neutral on their face, but deny individuals with 
handicaps an effective opportunity to participate.
    Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in 
Sec. 85.21(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of 
new facilities or existing facilities to be used by the agency. 
Paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional buildings 
at an existing site.
    Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the agency, in the selection of 
procurement contractors, from using criteria that subject qualified 
individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.
    Paragraph (b)(6) prohibits the agency from discriminating against 
qualified individuals with handicaps on the basis of handicap in the 
granting of licenses or certifications. A person is a qualified 
individual with handicaps with respect to licensing or certification if 
he or she can meet the essential eligibility requirements for receiving 
the license or certification (see Sec. 85.3).
    In addition, the agency may not establish requirements for the 
programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject

[[Page 380]]

qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of 
handicap. For example, the agency must comply with this requirement when 
establishing safety standards for the operations of licensees. In that 
case, the agency must ensure that the standards it promulgates do not 
discriminate against the employment of qualified individuals with 
handicaps in an impermissible manner.
    Paragraph (b)(6) does not extend section 504 directly to the 
programs or activities of licensees or certified entities themselves. 
The programs or activities of Federal licensees or certified entities 
are not themselves federally conducted programs or activities; nor are 
they programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance 
merely by virtue of the Federal license or certificate. However, as 
noted above, section 504 may affect the content of the rules established 
by the agency for the operation of the program or activity of the 
licensee or certified entity and thereby indirectly affect limited 
aspects of their operations.
    One commenter suggested pointing out that Federal licensees or 
certified entities, having received services from Federal employees 
during the process of licensing or certification, thereby become 
Federally assisted recipients, and are covered by 45 CFR Part 84. Such 
an argument is beyond the scope of this part, and is therefore not being 
included.
    Another commenter suggested including language such as that found in 
45 CFR 84.4(b)(1) to the effect that agencies may not perpetuate 
discrimination against qualified individuals with handicaps by providing 
significant assistance to an agency, organization or person that 
discriminates on the basis of handicap. Assistance from the agency that 
would provide significant support to an organization constitutes Federal 
financial assistance and the organization, as a recipient of such 
assistance, would be covered by the section 504 regulation for federally 
assisted programs.
    Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal 
statute or Executive order that are designed to benefit only individuals 
with handicaps or a given class of individuals with handicaps may be 
limited to individuals those with handicaps.
    Paragraph (d) provides that the agency must administer programs and 
activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the next of 
qualified individuals with handicaps, i.e. in a setting that enables 
individuals with handicaps to interact with nonhandicapped individuals 
to the fullest extent possible.

                        Section 85.31 Employment.

    Section 85.31 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in 
employment by the agency. Courts have held that section 504, as amended 
in 1978, covers the employment practices of Executive agencies. Gardner 
v. Morris, 752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); Smith v. United States 
Postal Service, 742 F.2d 257, 259-60 (6th Cir. 1984); Prewitt v. United 
States Postal Service, 662 F.2d 292, 302-04 (5th Cir. 1981). Contra 
McGuiness v. United States Postal Service, 744 F.2d 1318, 1320-21 (7th 
Cir. 1984); Boyd v. United States Postal Service, 752 F.2d 410, 413-14 
(9th Cir. 1985).
    Courts uniformly have held that, in order to give effect to section 
501 of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the 
administrative procedures of section 501 must be followed in processing 
complaints of employment discrimination under section 504. Morgan v. 
United States Postal Service, 798 F.2d 1162, 1164-65 (8th Cir. 1986); 
Smith, 742 F.2d at 262; Prewitt, 662 F.2d at 304. Accordingly, Sec. 
85.31 (Employment) of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements, 
and procedures of section 501 as established in regulations of the EEOC 
at 29 CFR Part 1613. Responsibility for coordinating enforcement of 
Federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment is assigned to the 
EEOC by Executive Order 12067 (3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). Under this 
authority, the EEOC establishes government-wide standards on 
nondiscrimination in employment on the basis of handicap.
    One commenter proposed that the general definition of qualified 
individual with handicaps be used in this section, instead of that used 
under section 501. We believe that the above paragraphs sufficiently 
explain the need for using the section 501 definition.
    In addition to this section, Sec. 85.61(c) specifies that the agency 
will use the existing EEOC procedures to resolve allegations of 
employment discrimination.

     Section 85.41 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Section 85.41 states the general nondiscrimination principle 
underlying the program accessibility requirements of Sec.Sec. 85.42 and 
85.43.

        Section 85.42 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    This part adopts the program accessibility concept found in the 
existing section 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities 
receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57) with certain 
modifications. Thus, Sec. 85.42 requires that each agency program or 
activity, when viewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with handicaps. The part also makes clear that the 
agency is not required to make each of its existing facilities 
accessible (Sec. 85.42(a)(1)). However, Sec. 85.42, unlike 28 CFR 41.57, 
places explicit limits on the agency's obligation to ensure program 
accessibility (Sec. 85.42(a)(2)).

[[Page 381]]

    One commenter stated that the provisions of Sec. 85.42(a)(1) were 
negatively worded and may reflect a misinterpretation of the decision of 
the Supreme Court in Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984), 
and argued for deletion of this language.
    The language is identical to that in the section 504 regulation for 
federally assisted programs or activities. We believe that the inclusion 
of this language is necessary in order to make clear that, while every 
aspect of every Federal program or activity need not be accessible, each 
program or activity, when viewed as a whole, must be accessible.
    Another commenter recommended adding the language ``where other 
methods are equally effective in achieving compliance from Sec. 84.42(b) 
to Sec. 84.42(a)(1). We believe that, because Sec.Sec. 84.42 (a) and (b) 
treat different aspects of the subject, their language must necessarily 
differ.
    Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies recent case law that defines the 
scope of the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This 
paragraph provides that in meeting the program accessibility 
requirement, the agency is not required to take any action that would 
result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or 
activity, or in undue financial and administrative burdens. A similar 
limitation is provided in Sec. 85.51(d). This provision is based on the 
Supreme Court's holding in Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 
U.S. 397 (1979), that section 504 does not require program modifications 
that result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program, and 
on the Court's statement that section 504 does not require modifications 
that would result in ``undue financial and administrative burdens.'' 442 
U.S. at 412. Since Davis, circuit courts have applied this limitation on 
a showing that only one of the two ``undue burdens'' would be created as 
a result of the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. 
See, e.g., Dopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); American 
Public Transit Association v. Lewis, 655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981).
    Paragraph (a)(2) and Sec. 85.51(d) are also supported by the Supreme 
Court's decision in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). Alexander 
involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reduction of inpatient 
hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days per year. 
Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 because it 
had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed without 
deciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an 
unjustifiable disparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the 
reduction was not ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination that 
might be prohibited by section 504 or its implementing regulation. Id at 
299.
    Relying on Davis, the Court said that section 504 guarantees 
qualified handicapped persons ``meaningful access to the benefits the 
grantee offers,'' id. at 301, and that ``reasonable adjustments in the 
nature of the benefit offered must at times be made to assure meaningful 
access.'' Id. n.21 (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not 
require `` `changes,' `adjustments,' or `modifications' to existing 
programs that would be `substantial' * * * or that would constitute 
`fundamental alteration[s] in the nature of a program.' '' Id. at n.20 
(citations omitted). Alexander supports the position, based on Davis and 
the earlier lower court decisions, that in some situations, certain 
accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency's program 
or activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrative burdens 
that the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory. 
Thus, failure to include such an ``undue burdens'' provision could lead 
to judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particular 
enforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation.
    This paragraph, however, does not establish an absolute defense; it 
does not relieve the agency of all obligations to individuals with 
handicaps. Although the agency is not required to take actions that 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens, it 
nevertheless must take any other steps necessary to ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
federally conducted program or activity.
    It is our view that compliance with Sec. 85.42(a) would in most 
cases not result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the 
agency. In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are 
undue, all agency resources available for use in the funding and 
operation of the conducted program or activity should be considered. The 
burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 85.42(a) would fundamentally 
alter the nature of a program or activity or would result in undue 
financial and administrative burdens rests with the agency. The decision 
that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made 
by the agency head or his or her designee, and must be accompanied by a 
written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. Any 
person who believes that he or she or any specific class of persons has 
been injured by the agency head's decision or failure to make a decision 
may file a complaint under the compliance procedures established in Sec. 
85.61. The opportunity to file such a complaint responds to one 
commenter's suggestion that review by a high level Department official 
be assured.
    Paragraph (b)(1) sets forth a number of means by which program 
accessibility may

[[Page 382]]

be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of services 
to accessible buildings, and provision of aides. In choosing among 
methods, the agency shall give priority consideration to those that will 
be consistent with provision of services in the most integrated setting 
appropriate to the needs of individuals with handicaps. Structural 
changes in existing facilities are required only when there is no other 
feasible way to make the agency's program accessible. (It should be 
noted that ``structural changes'' include all physical changes to a 
facility; the term does not refer only to changes to structural 
features, such as removal of or alteration to a load-bearing structural 
member.) The agency may comply with the program accessibility 
requirement by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or 
making home visits as appropriate.
    One commenter proposed that methods other than structural changes to 
ensure accessibility should be ``equally effective''. The regulations 
implementing section 504 for federally assisted programs do not contain 
such language. The addition of the proposed language would impose a 
regulatory standard on the Department not required of recipients. In 
view of the fact that the 1978 amendments were intended to apply the 
same requirements to federally conducted programs as apply to federally 
assisted programs, the proposed language is not being adopted.
    Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the 
program accessibility requirement. As currently required for federally 
assisted programs by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the agency must make any necessary 
structural changes in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event 
later than three (3) years after the effective date of this part. Where 
structural modifications are required and it is not expected that these 
can be completed within six months, a transition plan should be 
developed within six months of the effective date of this part. Aside 
from structural changes, all other necessary steps to achieve compliance 
shall be taken within sixty days.
    One commenter proposes to limit the time allowed for making 
structural modifications to one year. We note that the basic requirement 
is that these changes be made ``as soon as practicable,'' and that the 
three-year limit is the maximum period of time. Furthermore, the three-
year maximum for transition plans is identical to that contained in the 
regulations for federally assisted recipients.

 Section 85.43 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Overlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction and 
alterations under section 504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 
1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). Section 85.43 provides that 
those buildings that are constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for 
the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered to be 
readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps in 
accordance with 41 CFR Part 101-19, 101-19.600 to 101-19.607 (GSA 
regulation which incorporates the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards). This standard was promulgated pursuant to the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). We believe that 
it is appropriate to adopt the existing Architectural Barriers Act 
standard for section 504 compliance because new and altered buildings 
subject to this regulation are also subject to the Architectural 
Barriers Act and because adoption of the standard will avoid duplicative 
and possibly inconsistent standards.
    Existing buildings leased by the agency after the effective date of 
this regulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibility 
standards simply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however, 
to the program accessibility standards for existing facilities in Sec. 
85.42. To the extent the buildings are newly constructed or altered, 
they must also meet the new constructions and alteration requirements of 
Sec. 85.43.
    Federal practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased 
buildings as subject to the existing facility program accessibility 
standard. Unlike the construction of new buildings where architectural 
barriers can be avoided at little or no cost, the application of new 
construction standards to an existing building being leased raises the 
same prospect of retrofitting buildings as the use of an existing 
Federal facility, and the agency believes that same program 
accessibility standards should apply to both owned and leased existing 
buildings.
    In Rose v. United States Postal Service, 774 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir. 
1985), the Ninth Circuit held that the Architectural Barriers Act 
requires accessibility at the time of lease. The Rose court did not 
address the question of whether section 504 likewise requires 
accessibility as a condition of lease, and the case was remanded to the 
District Court for, among other things, consideration of this issue. Two 
commenters urged that leased buildings be required to be accessible at 
the time of lease. The agency may provide more specific guidance on 
section 504 requirements for leased buildings after the litigation is 
completed.

                      Section 85.51 Communications.

    Section 85.51 requires the agency to take appropriate steps to 
ensure effective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, 
applicants, participants, and members of the public. These steps shall 
include procedures for determining when auxiliary aids are necessary 
under Sec. 85.1(a)(1) to afford an

[[Page 383]]

individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and 
enjoy the benefits of, the agency's program or activity. They shall also 
include an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to request the 
auxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice shall be given 
primary consideration by the agency (Sec. 85.51(a)(1)(i)). The agency 
shall honor the choice unless it can demonstrate that another effective 
means of communication exists or that use of the means chosen would not 
be required under Sec. 85.51(d). That paragraph limits the obligations 
of the agency to ensure effective communication in accordance with Davis 
and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (see supra preamble 
discussion of Sec. 85.42(c)(2)). Unless not required by Sec. 85.51(d), 
the agency shall provide auxiliary aids at no cost to the individual 
with handicaps.
    One commenter proposed that the choice of auxiliary aid made by the 
individual with handicaps should govern unless it would constitute an 
undue hardship on the agency. We believe that the language set out above 
is adequate to ensure consideration of an individual's preference.
    Another commenter proposed that the regulation require all films and 
videotapes produced by the agency to be captioned for the hearing-
impaired. The Department intends to examine all appropriate methods of 
ensuring effective communication.
    The same commenter applauded HHS for the inclusion of the language 
requiring HHS to inform individuals with handicaps of their section 504 
rights.
    The discussion of Sec. 85.42(a), Program accessibility, Existing 
facilities, regarding the determination of what constitutes undue 
financial and administrative burdens, also applies to Sec. 85.51(d) and 
should be referred to for a complete understanding of the agency's 
obligation to comply with Sec. 85.51.
    In some circumstances, a notepad and written materials may be 
sufficient to permit effective communication with a hearing-impaired 
person. In many circumstances, however, they may not be, particularly 
when the information being communicated is complex or exchanged for a 
lengthy period of time (e.g. a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired 
applicant or participant is not skilled in spoken or written language. 
In these cases, a sign language interpreter may be appropriate.
    One commenter proposed changing the language to state that notepads 
rarely suffice for communication with the hearing-impaired. Considering 
that a significant number of the hearing-impaired may not be skilled in 
sign language, we believe that the language used is appropriate.
    For vision-impaired persons, effective communication might be 
achieved by several means, including readers and audio recordings. In 
general, the agency intends to inform the public of (1) the 
communications services it offers to afford individuals with handicaps 
an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its programs and 
activities, (2) the opportunity to request a particular mode of 
communication, and (3) the agency's preferences regarding auxiliary aids 
if it can demonstrate that several different modes are effective.
    The agency shall ensure effective communication with vision-impaired 
and hearing-impaired persons involved in proceedings conducted by the 
agency. Auxiliary aids must be afforded where necessary to ensure 
effective communication at the proceedings. If sign language 
interpreters are necessary, the agency may require that it be given 
reasonable notice prior to the proceedings of the need for an 
interpreter. Moreover, the agency need not provide individually 
prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices 
of a personal nature (Sec. 85.51(a)(1)(ii)). For example, the agency 
need not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicants or 
participants in its programs. Similarly, the regulation does not require 
the agency to provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments.
    One commenter proposed that the items which agencies are not 
required to provide and the circumstances involved be described in more 
detail. We believe that the description given is sufficient, because the 
interpretation of this provision will be made on a case-by-case basis.
    Paragraph (b) requires the agency to ensure that individuals with 
handicaps can obtain information concerning accessible services, 
activities, and facilities.
    Paragraph (c) requires the agency to provide signage at inaccessible 
facilities that direct users to locations with information about 
accessible facilities.
    One commenter suggested specifically mentioning the international 
symbol for deafness, and placing such signs at the main entrance of 
buildings equipped to service the hearing-impaired. We believe that the 
language contained in Sec.Sec. 85.51 (b) and (c) requires the agency to 
ensure that individuals with handicaps, including those with impaired 
hearing, can obtain information regarding accessibility, and that this 
requirement is sufficient to afford flexibility on the part of the 
agency regarding use of appropriate signage.
    One commenter proposed adding the words ``in the most integrated 
setting appropriate'' to the language in Sec. 85.51(d). This language 
already appears elsewhere in the regulation, e.g. in Sec. 85.42(b)(2), 
and it is the Department's intention to act in accordance with that 
provision.

                  Section 85.61 Compliance procedures.

    Paragraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (b) and (d) through (l) of 
this section establish

[[Page 384]]

the procedures for processing complaints other than employment 
complaints. Paragraph (c) provides that the agency will process 
employment complaints according to procedures established in existing 
regulations of the EEOC (29 CFR Part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).
    Paragraph (b) designates the official responsible for coordinating 
implementation of Sec. 85.61. The NPRM stated that responsibility for 
the implementation and operation of this ``part'' shall be vested in the 
OCR Director/Special Assistant. The final rule has been revised by 
replacing the word ``part'' with the word ``section'' to clarify the 
responsibility for coordinating implementation of Sec. 85.61.
    The agency is required to accept and investigate all complete 
complaints (Sec. 85.61(d)). Two commenters suggested that a complainant 
have an opportunity to remedy an incomplete complaint. Current 
administrative procedures provide for this practice and it need not be 
included in the text of the regulation.
    If the agency determines that it does not have jurisdiction over a 
complaint, it shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonable 
efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity of the Federal 
Government (Sec. 85.61(e)). One commenter pointed out that where a 
reference to another entity of the Federal government is required, the 
obligation to refer should be absolute, not limited to reasonable 
efforts. The language ``shall make reasonable efforts to refer'' is not 
intended to minimize the Department's obligation.
    Paragraph (f) requires the agency to notify the Architectural and 
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) upon receipt of a 
complaint alleging that a building or facility subject to the 
Architectural Barriers Act was designed, constructed, or altered in a 
manner that does not provide ready access and use by individuals with 
handicaps.
    Paragraph (g) requires the agency to provide to the complainant, in 
writing, findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief granted if 
noncompliance is found, and notice of the right to appeal (Sec. 
85.61(g)). One appeal within the agency shall be provided (Sec. 
85.61(i)). The appeal will not be heard by the same person who made the 
initial determination of compliance or noncompliance.
    Paragraph (1) permits the agency to delegate its authority for 
investigating complaints to other Federal agencies. However, the 
statutory obligation of the agency to make a final determination of 
compliance or noncompliance may not be delegated.
    Commenters have suggested the following:
    Notifying complainants whenever their complaints are referred to 
another agency. Current administrative procedures provide for this 
practice and it need not be included in the text of the regulation.
    Describing the basic parameters for submitting or obtaining evidence 
used to decide appeals. Since the grounds for appeal may be extremely 
varied, it would not be practicable to set out parameters for every 
appeal.
    Including a statement as to complainants' rights to judicial review. 
These rights are statutory and beyond the scope of this regulation.
    Obtaining the expertise of ATBCB in appropriate cases. A provision 
regarding notification of ATBCB is already included in the regulation.
    Including a statement that all other regulations, forms and 
directives issued by HHS are superseded by the nondiscrimination 
requirements of this part. The Department views any other issuances 
falling short of the requirements of this regulation as insufficient to 
ensure compliance and therefore such a statement is unnecessary.
    Provisions for attorneys fees and compensation to the prevailing 
party. Such provisions are statutory and beyond the scope of this 
regulation.

       Section 85.62 Coordination and compliance responsibilities.

    Section 85.62 sets out the respective responsibilities of the 
components of HHS and of the Director, OCR/Special Assistant in the 
implementation of section 504 to programs and activities conducted by 
HHS.
    Paragraph (c) specifies the respective roles of OCR and of the HHS 
component in cases in which noncompliance is found.
    In the event that OCR and the HHS component cannot agree on a 
resolution of any particular matter, such matter will be submitted to 
the Secretary for resolution.

(Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 
U.S.C. 1681, 1682)


<R05>
Sec. 86.3  Remedial and affirmative action and self-evaluation.

    (a) Remedial action. If the Director finds that a recipient has 
discriminated against persons on the basis of sex in an education 
program or activity, such recipient shall take such remedial action as 
the Director deems necessary to overcome the effects of such 
discrimination.
    (b) Affirmative action. In the absence of a finding of 
discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, 
a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of 
conditions which resulted in limited participation therein by persons of 
a particular sex. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to alter any 
affirmative action obligations which a recipient may have under 
Executive Order 11246.
    (c) Self-evaluation. Each recipient education institution shall, 
within one year of the effective date of this part:
    (1) Evaluate, in terms of the requirements of this part, its current

students, treatment of students, and employment of both academic and 
non-academic personnel working in connection with the recipient's 
education program or activity;
    (2) Modify any of these policies and practices which do not or may 
not meet the requirements of this part; and

of any modifications made pursuant to paragraph (c) (2) of this section 
and of any remedial steps taken pursuant to paragraph (c) (3) of this 
section.

(Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 
U.S.C. 1681, 1682)

[40 FR 24128, June 4, 1975; 40 FR 39506, Aug. 28, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 86.4  Assurance required.

    (a) General. Every application for Federal financial assistance for 
any education program or activity shall as condition of its approval 
contain or be accompanied by an assurance from the applicant or 
recipient, satisfactory to the Director, that each education program or 
activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which this part 
applies will be operated in compliance with this part. An assurance of 
compliance with this part shall not be satisfactory to the Director if 
the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to 
commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in 
accordance with Sec. 86.3(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the 
basis of sex or to eliminate the effects

[[Page 388]]

of past discrimination whether occurring prior or subsequent to the 
submission to the Director of such assurance.
    (b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial 
assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such 
assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent 
transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property 
or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.
    (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide 
personal property, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the 
period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
    (3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient 
for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
    (c) Form. The Director will specify the form of the assurances 
required by paragraph (a) of this section and the extent to which such 
assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's 
subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in 
interest.

(Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 
U.S.C. 1681, 1682)


<R05>
Sec. 86.5  Transfers of property.

    If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in 
whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee which 
operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the 
fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer 
properly accounted for to the Federal Government both the transferor and 
the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the 
provisions of Subpart B of this part.

(Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 
U.S.C. 1681, 1682)


<R05>
Sec. 86.6  Effect of other requirements.

    (a) Effect of other Federal provisions. The obligations imposed by 
this part are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to 
discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, as 
amended; sections 799A and 845 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 295h-9 and 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
U.S.C. 2000e et seq.); the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206 and 206(d)); and 
any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.


(Secs. 901, 902, 905, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374, 
375; 20 U.S.C. 1681, 1682, 1685)

    (b) Effect of State or local law or other requirements. The 
obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any 
State or local law or other requirement which would render any applicant 
or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or 
student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.
    (c) Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations. The 
obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any 
rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, 
or association which would render any applicant or student ineligible to 
participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant 
or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity

paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use 
procedures under which:
    (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the 
basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability 
of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
    (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other 
form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was 
selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the 
absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial 
assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.
    (c) Athletic scholarships. (1) To the extent that a recipient awards 
athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable 
opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to 
the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or 
intercollegiate athletics.
    (2) Separate athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid for members of 
each sex may be provided as part of separate athletic teams for members 
of each sex to the extent consistent with this paragraph and Sec. 86.41.

Sec. 86.38  Employment assistance to students.

    (a) Assistance by recipient in making available outside employment. 
A recipient which assists any agency, organization or person in making 
employment available to any of its students:
    (1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available 
without discrimination on the basis of sex; and
    (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or 
person which discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment 
practices.
    (b) Employment of students by recipients. A recipient which employs 
any of its students shall not do so in a manner which violates Subpart E 
of this part.

(Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20

<R05>
Sec. 86.39  Health and insurance benefits and services.

    In providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance 
benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient 
shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, 
service, policy, or plan in a manner which would violate Subpart E of 
this part if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This 
section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or 
service which may be used by a different proportion of students of one 
sex than of the other, including family planning services. However, any 
recipient which provides full coverage health service shall provide 
gynecological care.

(Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 
U.S.C. 1681, 1682)


<R05>
Sec. 86.40  Marital or parental status.

    (a) Status generally. A recipient shall not apply any rule 
concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital 
status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.
    (b) Pregnancy and related conditions. (1) A recipent shall not 
discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its 
education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular 
activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false 
pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom, unless the 
student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the 
program or activity of the recipient.
    (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the 
certification of a physician that the student is physically and 
emotionally able to continue participation in the normal education 
program or activity so long as such a certification is required of all 
students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the 
attention of a physician.
    (3) A recipient which operates a portion of its education program or 
activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is 
completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall ensure that the instructional program in 
the separate program is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant 
students.
    (4) A recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, 
termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and 
under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect 
to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan or policy which such 
recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect 
to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.
    (5) In the case of a recipient which does not maintain a leave 
policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not 
otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat 
pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and 
recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for so long 
a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's 
physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to 
the status which she held when the leave began.

(Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 
U.S.C. 1681, 1682)


<R05>
Sec. 86.41  Athletics.

    (a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from 
another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any 
interscholastic, intercollegiate,

[[Page 397]]

club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient 
shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.
    (b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams 
for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon 
competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, 
where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for 
members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of 
the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have 
previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to 
try-out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact 
sport. For the purposes of this part, contact sports include boxing, 
wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball and other sports the 
purpose of major activity of which involves bodily contact.
    (c) Equal opportunity. A recipient which operates or sponsors 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics shall 
provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In 
determining whether equal opportunities are available the Director will 
consider, among other factors:
    (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition 
effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both 
sexes;
    (2) The provision of equipment and supplies;
    (3) Scheduling of games and practice time;
    (4) Travel and per diem allowance;
    (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
    (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
    (7) Provision of locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities;
    (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;
    (9) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;
    (10) Publicity.

Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal 
expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or 
sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this 
section, but the Director may consider the failure to provide necessary 
funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for 
members of each sex.
    (d) Adjustment period. A recipient which operates or sponsors 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics at the 
elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as 
expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from the 
effective date of this regulation. A recipient which operates or 
sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics 
at the secondary or post-secondary school level shall comply fully with 
this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than 
three years from the effective date of this regulation.

    (a) General. (1) No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded 
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination in employment, or recruitment, consideration, or 
selection therefor, whether full-time or part-time, under any education 
program or activity operated by a recipient which receives or benefits 
from Federal financial assistance.

[[Page 398]]

    (2) A recipient shall make all employment decisions in any education 
program or activity operated by such recipient in a nondiscriminatory 
manner and shall not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or 
employees in any way which could adversely affect any applicant's or 
employee's employment opportunities or status because of sex.
    (3) A recipient shall not enter into any contractual or other 
relationship which directly or indirectly has the effect of subjecting 
employees or students to discrimination prohibited by this subpart, 
including relationships with employment and referral agencies, with 
labor unions, and with organizations providing or administering fringe 
benefits to employees of the recipient.
    (4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for 
employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or 
entity which admits as students only or predominantly members of one 
sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating 
on the basis of sex in violation of this part.
    (b) Application. The provisions of this subpart apply to:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the process of application for 
employment;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, consideration for and award of 
tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, application of nepotism

not administered by the recipient;
    (8) Selection and financial support for training, including 
apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related

Sec. 86.52  Employment criteria.

    A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other 
criterion for any employment opportunity which has a disproportionately 
adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless:
    (a) Use of such test or other criterion is shown to predict validly 
successful performance in the position in question; and
    (b) Alternative tests or criteria for such purpose, which do not 
have such disproportionately adverse effect, are shown to be 
unavailable.

<R05>
Sec. 86.53  Recruitment.

    (a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment and hiring. A recipient shall not 
discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and hiring of 
employees. Where a recipient has been found to be presently 
discriminating on the basis of sex in the recruitment or hiring of 
employees, or has been found to have in the past so discriminated, the 
recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so 
as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.
    (b) Recruitment patterns. A recipient shall not recruit primarily or 
exclusively at entities which furnish as applicants only or 
predominantly members of one sex if such actions have the effect of 
discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this subpart.

responsibility, and which are performed under similar working 
conditions.

positions in question as set forth in Sec. 86.61.

plan which does not provide either for equal periodic benefits for 
members of each sex, or for equal contributions to the plan by such 
recipient for members of each sex; or

employment action:
    (1) Concerning the potential marital, parental, or family status of

justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period 
of time, at the conclusion of which the

    A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by this subpart 
provided it is shown that sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification 
for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such 
action is essential to successful operation of the employment function 
concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section 
which is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or 
stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon 
preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other 
persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient 
from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker 
room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 90.1  What is the purpose of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975?

    The Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, is designed to 
prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities 
receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act also permits federally 
assisted programs and activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to 
continue to use certain age distinctions and factors other than age 
which meet the requirements of the Act and these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 90.2  What is the purpose of these regulations?

    (a) The purpose of these regulations is to state general, 
government-wide rules for the implementation of the Age Discrimination 
Act of 1975, as amended, and to guide each agency in the preparation of 
agency-specific age discrimination regulations.
    (b) These regulations apply to each Federal agency which provides 
Federal financial assistance to any program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 90.3  What programs and activities does the Age Discrimination Act of 
1975 cover?

    (a) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 applies to any program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, including programs or 
activities receiving funds under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance 
Act of 1972 (31 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.).
    (b) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 does not apply to:
    (1) An age distinction contained in that part of a Federal, State or 
local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose 
legislative body which:
    (i) Provides any benefits or assistance to persons based on age; or
    (ii) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or
    (iii) Describes intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-
related terms.
    (2) Any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, 
labor

[[Page 404]]

organization, or any labor-management joint apprenticeship training 
program, except for any program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance for public service employment under the Comprehensive 
Employment and Training Act of 1974 (CETA), (29 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).


<R05>

    (b) Services of Federal personnel; or
    (c) Real and personal property or any interest in or use of 
property, including:
    (1) Transfers or leases of property for less than fair market value 
or for reduced consideration; and
    (2) Proceeds from a subsequent transfer or lease of property if the 
Federal share of its fair market value is not returned to the Federal 
Government.
    Recipient means any State or its political subdivision, any 
instrumentality of a State or its political sub-division, any public or

<R04>
                 Subpart B--What is Age Discrimination?

           Standards for Determining Discriminatory Practices


<R05>
Sec. 90.11  Purpose of this subpart.

    The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the prohibitions against 
age discrimination and the exceptions to those prohibitions.


<R05>
Sec. 90.12  Rules against age discrimination.

    The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions 
contained in Sec.Sec. 90.14, and 90.15 of these regulations.
    (a) General rule: No person in the United states shall, on the basis 
of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or 
be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance.
    (b) Specific rules: A recipient may not, in any program or activity 
receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual, 
licensing, or other arrangements use age distinctions or take any other 
actions which have the effect, on the basis of age, of:
    (1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or 
subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance, or
    (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to 
participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance.

[[Page 405]]

    (c) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) 
of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.


<R05>
Sec. 90.13  Definitions of normal operation and statutory objective.

    For purposes of Sec.Sec. 90.14, and 90.15, the terms normal 
operation and statutory objective shall have the following meaning:
    (a) Normal operation means the operation of a program or activity 
without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its 
objectives.
    (b) Statutory objective means any purpose of a program or activity 
expressly stated in any Federal statute, State statute, or local statute 
or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body.


<R05>
Sec. 90.14  Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination. Normal 
operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.

    A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by 
Sec. 90.12, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor 
necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory 
objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into 
account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the 
achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:
    (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other 
characteristics; and
    (b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in 
order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, 
or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and
    (c) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or 
approximated by the use of age; and
    (d) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly 
on an individual basis.


<R05>
Sec. 90.15  Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination. Reasonable 
factors other than age.

    A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by 
Sec. 90.12 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that 
action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. 
An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor 
bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of 
the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.


<R05>
Sec. 90.16  Burden of proof.

    The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls 
within the exceptions outlined in Sec.Sec. 90.14 and 90.15 is on the 
recipient of Federal financial assistance.


<R04>
    Subpart C--What are the Responsibilities of the Federal Agencies?


<R05>
Sec. 90.31  Issuance of regulations.

    (a) The head of each agency which extends Federal financial 
assistance to any program or activity shall publish proposed and final 
age discrimination regulations in the Federal Register to:
    (1) Carry out the provisions of section 303 of the Age 
Discrimination Act of 1975; and
    (2) Provide for appropriate investigative, conciliation, and 
enforcement procedures.
    (b) Each agency shall publish its proposed agency age discrimination 
regulations no later than 90 days after the publication date of the 
final general, government-wide age discrimination regulations.
    (c) Each agency shall submit its final agency regulations to HHS for 
review no later than 120 days after publication of proposed agency age 
discrimination regulations.
    (d) Final agency age discrimination regulations shall be consistent 
with these general, government-wide age discrimination regulations and 
shall not be published until the Secretary approves them.
    (e) Each agency shall include in its regulations a provision 
governing the operation of an alternate funds disbursal procedure as 
described in Sec. 90.48 of these regulations.
    (f) Each agency shall publish an appendix to its final age 
discrimination regulations containing a list of each age distinction 
provided in a Federal

[[Page 406]]

statute or in regulations affecting financial assistance administered by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 90.32  Review of agency policies and administrative practices.

    (a) Each agency shall conduct a review of age distinctions it 
imposes on its recipients by regulations, policies, and administrative 
practices. The purpose of this review is to identify how age 
distinctions are used by each Federal agency and whether those age 
distinctions are permissible under the Act and implementing regulations.
    (b) No later than 12 months from the date the agency published its 
final regulations, the agency shall publish, for public comment, a 
report in the Federal Register containing:
    (1) The results of the review conducted under paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (2) A list of the age distinctions contained in regulations which 
are to be continued;
    (3) The justification under the requirements of the Act and these 
regulations for each age distinction to be continued;
    (4) A list of the age distinctions not contained in regulations but 
which will be adopted by regulation under the Administrative Procedure 
Act using the notice and comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553; 
and
    (5) A list of the age distinctions to be eliminated.
    (c) Beginning with the effective date of an agency's final 
regulations, the agency may not impose a new age distinction unless the 
age distinction is adopted by regulation under the Administrative 
Procedure Act using the notice and comment procedures specified in 5 
U.S.C. 553.
    (d) Beginning 12 months after the publication of its age 
discrimination regulations, an agency may not continue an existing age 
distinction, unless the age distinction has already been adopted by 
regulation or is adopted by regulation under the Administrative 
Procedure Act using the notice and comment procedures specified in 5 
U.S.C. 553.


<R05>
Sec. 90.33  Interagency cooperation.

    Where two or more agencies provide Federal financial assistance to a 
recipient or class of recipients, the Secretary may designate one of the 
agencies as the sole agency for all compliance and enforcement purposes 
with respect to those recipients, except for the ordering of termination 
of funds and the notification of the appropriate committees of Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 90.34  Agency reports.

    Each agency shall submit to the Secretary not later than December 31 
of each year, beginning in 1979, a report which:
    (a) Describes in detail the steps taken during the preceding fiscal 
year to carry out the Act; and
    (b) Contains data on the frequency, type, and resolution of 
complaints and on any compliance reviews, sufficient to permit analysis 
of the agency's progress in reducing age discrimination in programs 
receiving Federal financial assistance from the agency; and
    (c) Contains data directly relevant to the extent of any pattern or 
practice of age discrimination which the agency has identified in any 
programs receiving Federal financial assistance from the agency and to 
progress toward eliminating it; and
    (d) Contains evaluative or interpretative information which the 
agency determines is useful in analyzing agency progress in reducing age 
discrimination in programs receiving Federal financial assistance from 
the agency; and
    (e) Contains whatever other data the Secretary may require.


<R04>
    Subpart D--Investigation, Conciliation and Enforcement Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 90.41  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart sets forth requirements for the establishment of 
compliance, investigation, conciliation, and enforcement procedures by 
agencies which extend Federal financial assistance.

[[Page 407]]


<R05>
Sec. 90.42  What responsibilities do recipients and agencies have generally 
to ensure compliance with the Act?

    (a) A recipient has primary responsibility to ensure that its 
programs and activities are in compliance with the Age Discrimination 
Act and shall take steps to eliminate violations of the Act. A recipient 
also has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and to 
afford access to its records to an agency to the extent required to 
determine whether it is in compliance with the Act.
    (b) An agency has responsibility to attempt to secure recipient 
compliance with the Act by voluntary means. This may include the use of 
the services of appropriate Federal, State, local, or private 
organizations. An agency also has the responsibility to enforce the Age 
Discrimination Act when a recipient fails to eliminate violations of the 
Act.


<R05>
Sec. 90.43  What specific responsibilities do agencies and recipients have 
to ensure compliance with the Act?

    (a) Written notice, technical assistance, and educational materials. 
Each agency shall: (1) Provide written notice to each recipient of its 
obligations under the Act. The notice shall include a requirement that 
where the recipient initially receiving funds makes the funds available 
to a sub-recipient, the recipient must notify the sub-recipient of its 
obligations under the Act.
    (2) Provide technical assistance, where necessary, to recipients to 
aid them in complying with the Act.
    (3) Make available educational materials setting forth the rights 
and obligations of beneficiaries and recipients under the Act.
    (b) Self-evaluation. (1) Each agency shall require each recipient 
employing the equivalent of 15 or more full time employees to complete a 
written self-evaluation of its compliance under the Act within 18 months 
of the effective date of the agency regulations.
    (2) Each recipient's self-evaluation shall identify and justify each 
age distinction imposed by the recipient.
    (3) Each recipient shall take corrective and remedial action 
whenever a self-evaluation indicates a violation of the Act.
    (4) Each recipient shall make the self-evaluation available on 
request to the agency and to the public for a period of 3 years 
following its completion.
    (c) Complaints--(1) Receipt of complaints. Each agency shall 
establish a complaint processing procedure which includes the following:
    (i) A procedure for the filing of complaints with the agency;
    (ii) A review of complaints to assure that they fall within the 
coverage of the Act and contain all information necessary for further 
processing;
    (iii) Notice to the complainant and the recipient of their rights 
and obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to 
have a representative at all stages of the complaint procedure; and
    (iv) Notice to the complainant and the recipient (or their 
representatives) of their right to contact the agency for information 
and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.
    (2) Prompt resolution of complaints. Each agency shall establish 
procedures for the prompt resolution of complaints. These procedures 
shall require each recipient and complainant to participate actively in 
efforts toward speedy resolution of the complaint.
    (3) Mediation of complaints. Each agency shall promptly refer all 
complaints which fall within the coverage of the Act to a mediation 
agency designated by the Secretary.
    (i) The referring agency shall require the participation of the 
recipient and the complainant in the mediation process, although both 
parties need not meet with the mediator at the same time.
    (ii) If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory 
resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, they shall 
reduce the agreement to writing. The mediator shall send a copy of the 
settlement to the referring agency. No further action shall be taken 
based on that complaint unless it appears that the complainant or the 
recipient is failing to comply with the agreement.
    (iii) Not more than 60 days after the agency receives the complaint, 
the mediator shall return a still unresolved complaint to the referring 
agency for

[[Page 408]]

initial investigation. The mediator may return a complaint at any time 
before the end of the 60 day period if it appears that the complaint 
cannot be resolved through mediation.
    (iv) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all 
information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator 
shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or

Act without regard to its procedures for handling complaints.
    (b) If a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation 
of the Act, the agency shall attempt to achieve voluntary compliance 
with the Act. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, the agency

          been committed?

    (a) Each agency shall provide for enforcement of its regulations 
through:
    (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance under 
the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the 
Act or the agency's regulations. The determination of the recipient's 
violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for 
a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge.
    (2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:
    (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce 
any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created 
by the Act or the agency's regulations.
    (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or 
local government agency which will have the effect of correcting a 
violation of the Act or implementing regulations.
    (b) Any termination under paragraph (a)(1) shall be limited to the 
particular

[[Page 409]]

recipient and particular program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance or portion thereof found to be in violation of the Act or 
agency regulations. No termination shall be based in whole or in part on 
a finding with respect to any program or activity which does not receive 
Federal financial assistance.
    (c) No action under paragraph (a) of this section may be taken 
until:
    (1) The head of the agency involved has advised the recipient of its 
failure to comply with the Act or the agency's regulations and has 
determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.
    (2) Thirty days have elapsed after the head of the agency involved

to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over 
the Federal program or activity involved. A report shall be filed 
whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) An agency may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to 
a recipient when termination proceedings under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section are initiated.
    (1) New Federal financial assistance includes all assistance 
administered by or through the agency for which an application or 
approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or 
authorization of new activities, is required during the deferral period. 
New Federal financial assistance does not include assistance approved 
prior to the beginning of termination proceedings or to increases in 
funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards.
    (2) A deferral may not begin until the recipient has received a 
notice of opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (a)(1). A deferral 
may not continue for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within 
that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by 
mutual consent of the recipient and the agency. A deferral may not 
continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless 
the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 90.48  Alternate funds disbursal procedure.

    When an agency withholds funds from a recipient under its 
regulations issued under Sec. 90.31, the head of the agency may disburse 
the withheld funds so directly to any public or non-profit private 
organization or agency, or State or political subdivision of the State. 
These alternate recipients must demonstrate the ability to comply with 
the agency's regulations issued under this Act and to achieve the goals 
of the Federal statute authorizing the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 90.49  Remedial and affirmative action by recipients.

    (a) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated on the basis of 
age, the recipient shall take any remedial action which the agency may 
require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another 
recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, 
both recipients may be required to take remedial action.
    (b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient 
may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that 
resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity 
on the basis of age.
    (c) If a recipient operating a program which serves the elderly or 
children in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits 
to the elderly or to children the provision of those benefits shall be 
presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not 
have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from 
participation in the program.


<R05>
Sec. 90.50  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

    (a) The agency shall provide in its regulations that a complainant 
may file a civil action following the exhaustion of adminstrative 
remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:
    (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint 
and the agency has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
    (2) The agency issues any finding in favor of the recipient.

[[Page 410]]

    (b) If either of the conditions set forth in Sec. 90.50(a) is

    (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right, under section 305(e) 
of the Act, to bring a civil action for injunctive relief that will 
effect the purposes of the Act; and
    (3) Inform the complainant:
    (i) That a civil action can only be brought in a United States 
district court for the district in which the recipient is found or 
transacts business;
    (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right 
to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's 
fees, but that these costs must be demanded in the complaint;
    (iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 
30 days notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General 
of the United States, the head of the granting agency, and the 
recipient;
    (iv) That the notice shall state: the alleged violation of the Act; 
the relief requested; the court in which the action will be brought; and 
whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant 
prevails; and
    (v) That no action shall be brought if the same alleged violation of 
the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any 
court of the United States.

agency.
    (3) HHS will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the

    (a) HHS may enforce the Act and these regulations through:
    (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from 
HHS under the program or activity involved where the recipient has 
violated the Act or these regulations. The determination of the 
recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an 
opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law 
judge.
    (2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:
    (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce 
any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created 
by the Act or these regulations.
    (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or 
local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a 
violation of the Act or these regulations.

[[Page 416]]

    (b) HHS will limit any termination under Sec. 91.46(a)(1) to the 
particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such 
program and activity HHS finds in violation of these regulations. HHS 
will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any 
program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal 
financial assistance from HHS.
    (c) HHS will take no action under paragraph (a) until:
    (1) The Secretary has advised the recipient of its failure to comply 
with the Act and these regulations and has determined that voluntary 
compliance cannot be obtained.
    (2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Secretary has sent a written 
report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees 
of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the Federal program 
or activity involved. The Secretary will file a report whenever any 
action is taken under paragraph (a).
    (d) HHS also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance 
from HHS to a recipient when a hearing under Sec. 91.46(a)(1) is 
initiated.
    (1) New Federal financial assistance from HHS includes all 
assistance for which HHS requires an application or approval, including 
renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new 
activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance 
from HHS does not include increases in funding as a result of changed 
computation of formula awards or assistance approved prior to the 
beginning of a hearing under Sec. 91.46(a)(1).
    (2) HHS will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a 
notice of an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 91.46(a)(1). HHS will 
not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun 
within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended 
by mutual consent of the recipient and the Secretary. HHS will not 
continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the 
hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.
    (3) HHS will limit any deferral to the particular recipient and 
particular program or activity or part of such program or activity HHS 
finds in violation of these regulations. HHS will not base any part of a 
deferral on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the 
recipient which does not, and would not in connection with the new 
funds, receive Federal financial assistance from HHS.


<R05>
Sec. 91.47  Hearings, decisions, post-termination proceedings.

    Certain HHS procedural provisions applicable to Title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply to HHS enforcement of these regulations. 
They are found at 45 CFR 80.9 through 80.11 and 45 CFR Part 81.


<R05>
Sec. 91.48  Remedial action by recipient.

    Where HHS finds a recipient has discriminated on the basis of age, 
the recipient shall take any remedial action that HHS may require to 
overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient 
exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, HHS may 
require both recipients to take remedial action.


<R05>
Sec. 91.49  Alternate funds disbursal procedure.

    (a) When HHS withholds funds from a recipient under these 
regulations, the Secretary may disburse the withheld funds directly to 
an alternate recipient: any public or non-profit private organization or 
agency, or State or political subdivision of the State.
    (b) The Secretary will require any alternate recipient to 
demonstrate:
    (1) The ability to comply with these regulations; and
    (2) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute 
authorizing the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 91.50  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

    (a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion 
of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are 
exhausted if:
    (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint 
and HHS has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
    (2) HHS issues any finding in favor of the recipient.

[[Page 417]]

    (b) If HHS fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a 
finding in favor of the recipient, HHS shall:
    (1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact; and
    (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil 
action for injunctive relief; and
    (3) Inform the complainant:
    (i) That the complainant may bring a civil action only in a United 
States district court for the district in which the recipient is found 
or transacts business;
    (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right 
to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's 
fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;
    (iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 
30 days notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General 
of the United States, and the recipient;
    (iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the Act; 
the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the 
action; and, whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event 
the complainant prevails; and
    (v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged 
violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending 
action in any court of the United States.

[[Page 418]]


<R05>
Sec. 92.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 
``Financial Status Report'' (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat 
688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form

[[Page 419]]

of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, 
insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term does not include 
assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum award, which the 
grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action

[[Page 420]]

by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the grant, or 
(2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance with agency 
regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a person from 
participating in grant transactions for a period, pending completion of 
an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. ``Termination'' does not include: (1) 
Withdrawal of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate 
of the unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the 
unobligated balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to 
extend a grant r award additional funds, to make a competing or 
noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or 
(4) voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained 
fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.


<R05>

[[Page 421]]


<R05>

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 92.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 92.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its 
effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of 
the plan.

[[Page 422]]


<R05>
Sec. 92.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 92.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information

[[Page 423]]

must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 92.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR Part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1)

[[Page 424]]

Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest 
earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments 
for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 92.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 92.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           For the costs of a--                Use the principles in--

                                             acceptable to the Federal
                                             agency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 92.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.

[[Page 425]]

    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 92.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 92.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 92.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:

[[Page 426]]

    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching,
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 92.22, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal

[[Page 427]]

funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 92.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, 
fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 92.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Sec.Sec. 92.31 
and 92.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award

[[Page 428]]

period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see 
paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the 
Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 92.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 92.36 
shall be followed.

[53 FR 8079, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 45939, 45945, Aug.

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 92.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (1) Approvals shall not be valid unless they are in writing, and 
signed by at least one of the following officials of the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS):
    (i) The responsible Grants Officer or his or her designee;
    (ii) The head of the HHS Operating or Staff Division that awarded 
the grant; or
    (iii) The head of the Regional Office of the HHS Operating or Staff 
Division that awarded the grant.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 92.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of 
costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and 
subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.

[[Page 429]]

    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 92.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, supplies, 
and general support services.
    (5) Providing medical care to individuals under research grants.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 92.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.

1988]


<R05>
Sec. 92.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency.

[[Page 430]]

The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by applying the 
awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the 
original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in 
those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real 
property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real 
property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition 
may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 92.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 92.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.

[[Page 431]]

    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 92.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 92.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 92.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 92.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or

[[Page 432]]

ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs under 
Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 92.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.

[[Page 433]]

    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 92.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and

[[Page 434]]

standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. 
Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. 
When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate 
description of the technical requirements, a ``brand name or equal'' 
description may be used as a means to define the performance or other 
salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the 
named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 92.36(d)(2)(i) apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;

[[Page 435]]

    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the

[[Page 436]]

general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A price 
analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 92.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the

[[Page 437]]

awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the 
grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has made a 
determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately 
protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum 
requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)
    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or

<R05>
Sec. 92.37  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow state law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 92.42 is placed 
in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or

Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part 
do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:
    (1) Section 92.10;

               Reports, Records Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 92.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.

[[Page 439]]

    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 92.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decisionmaking purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.

[[Page 440]]

    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with Sec. 92.41(e)(2)(iii).
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through and analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end f each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in Sec. 
92.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs--(1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method. (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction 
grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, 
however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form,

[[Page 441]]

specified in Sec. 92.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 92.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance. (i) When a 
construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays 
to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will 
provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and due 
date shall be governed by Sec. 92.41(b) (3) and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 92.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 92.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 92.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 92.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 92.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.

[[Page 442]]

    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records unless required 
by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not 
required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 92.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,

[[Page 443]]

    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 92.35).


<R05>
Sec. 92.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 92.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 92.43 
or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart D--After-the-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 92.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report:

In accordance with Sec. 92.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of 
all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with 
grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition 
instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 92.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 92.42;
    (d) Property management requirements in Sec.Sec. 92.31 and 92.32; 
and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 92.26.


<R05>
Sec. 92.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements,

[[Page 444]]

    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

<R04>
                 Subpart B--Activities by Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 93.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 93.100 
(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation 
made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment 
is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to 
a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an

<R05>
Sec. 93.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 93.100 
(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation 
made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, 
continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, 
grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or 
technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or 
negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, professional and 
technical services shall be limited to advice and analysis directly 
applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting 
of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is 
allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.

compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.

            Subpart C--Activities by Other than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 93.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 93.100 
(a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, 
other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a 
covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical 
services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or 
negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 93.110 (a) and (b) regarding 
filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply 
with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in 
the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing 
for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, professional and 
technical services shall be limited to advice and

[[Page 449]]

analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For 
example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by 
a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an 
engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of 
equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is 
allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by 
a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such 
as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless 
they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or 
technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered 
directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the 
intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or 
analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her 
client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are 
not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R04>
                  Subpart D--Penalties and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 93.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
Appendix B to this part) to be filed or amended if required herein, 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not 
more than $100,000 for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.

Sec. 94.1  Purpose.

    This part promotes objectivity in research by establishing standards

    This part is applicable to each Institution that seeks PHS funding 
for research and, through the implementation of this part, to each 
Investigator who participates in such research (see Sec. 94.4(a));

that policy, the Investigator's reporting responsibilities, and of these 
regulations. If the Institution carries out the PHS-funded research 
through subcontractors, or collaborators, the Institution must take 
reasonable steps to ensure that Investigators working for such entities 
comply with this part, either by requiring those Investigators to comply 
with the Institution's policy or by requiring the entities to provide 
assurances to the Institution that will enable the Institution to comply 
with this part.
    (b) Designate an institutional official(s) to solicit and review 
financial disclosure statements from each Investigator who is planning 
to participate in PHS-funded research.
    (c)(1) Require that by the time an application is submitted to PHS, 
each Investigator who is planning to participate in the PHS-funded 
research has submitted to the designated official(s) a listing of his/
her known Significant Financial Interests (and those of his/her spouse 
and dependent children):
    (i) that would reasonably appear to be affected by the research for 
which PHS funding is sought; and
    (ii) in entities whose financial interests would reasonably appear 
to be affected by the research.
    (2) All financial disclosures must be updated during the period of 
the award, either on an annual basis or as new reportable Significant 
Financial Interests are obtained.
    (d) Provide guidelines consistent with this part for the designated 
official(s) to identify conflicting interests and take such actions as 
necessary to ensure that such conflicting interests will be managed, 
reduced, or eliminated.
    (e) Maintain records of all financial disclosures and all actions 
taken by the Institution with respect to each conflicting interest for 
three years after final payment or, where applicable, for the other time 
periods specified in 48 CFR part 4, subpart 4.7.
    (f) Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for 
sanctions where appropriate.
    (g) Certify, in each contract proposal, that:
    (1) there is in effect at that Institution a written and enforced 
administrative process to identify and manage, reduce or eliminate 
conflicting interests with respect to all research projects for which 
funding is sought from the PHS;
    (2) prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under the 
award, the Institution will report to the PHS Awarding Component the 
existence of any conflicting interest (but not the nature of the 
interest or other details) found by the Institution and assure that the 
interest has been managed, reduced or eliminated in accordance with this 
part; and, for any interest that the Institution identifies as 
conflicting subsequent to the Institution's initial report under the 
award, the report will be made and the conflicting interest managed, 
reduced, or eliminated, at least on an interim basis, within sixty days 
of that identification.
    (3) the Institution agrees to make information available, upon 
request, to the HHS regarding all conflicting interests identified by 
the Institution and how those interests have been managed, reduced, or 
eliminated to protect the research from bias; and
    (4) the Institution will otherwise comply with this part.

<R05>
Sec. 94.5  Management of conflicting interests.

    (a) The designated official(s) must: Review all financial 
disclosures; and determine whether a conflict of interest exists, and is 
so, what actions should be taken by the institution to manage, reduce, 
or eliminate such conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists 
when the designated official(s) reasonably determines that a Significant 
Financial Interest could directly and significantly affect the design, 
conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research. Examples of conditions 
or restrictions that might be imposed to manage conflicts of interest 
include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Public disclosure of significant financial interests;
    (2) Monitoring of the research by independent reviewers;
    (3) Modification of the research plan;
    (4) Disqualification from participation in all or a portion of the 
research funded by the PHS;
    (5) Divestiture of significant financial interests, or;
    (6) Severance of relationships that create actual or potential 
conflicts.
    (b) In addition to the types of conflicting financial interests 
described in this paragraph that must be managed, reduced, or 
eliminated, an Institution may require the management of other 
conflicting financial interests, as the Institution deems appropriate.

[60 FR 35817, July 11, 1995; 60 FR 39077, July 31, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 94.6  Remedies.

    (a) If the failure of an Investigator to comply with the conflict of 
interest policy of the Institution has biased the design, conduct, or 
reporting of the PHS-funded research, the Institution must promptly 
notify the PHS Awarding Component of the corrective action taken or to 
be taken. The PHS Awarding Component will consider the situation and, as 
necessary, take appropriate action or refer the matter to the 
institution for further action, which may include directions to the 
Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the funded 
project.
    (b) The HHS may at any time inquire into the Institutional 
procedures and actions regarding conflicting financial interests in PHS-
funded research, including a review of all records pertinent to 
compliance with this part. HHS may require submission of the records or 
review them on site. To the extent permitted by law HHS will maintain 
the confidentiality of all records of financial interests. On the basis 
of its review of records and/or other information that may be available, 
the PHS Awarding Component may decide that a particular conflict of 
interest will bias the objectivity of the PHS-funded research to such an 
extent that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution 
has not managed, reduced, or eliminated the conflict of interest in 
accordance with this part. The issuance of a Stop Work Order by the 
Contracting Officer may be necessary until the matter is resolved.
    (c) In any case in which the HHS determines that a PHS-funded 
project of clinical research whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or 
effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment has been designed, 
conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a conflicting interest 
that was not disclosed or managed as required by this part, the 
Institution must require disclosure of the conflicting interest in each 
public presentation of the results of the research.

program. We consider a State agency's expenditure under these titles for 
non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been made in the

Sec. 95.507  Plan requirements.

    (a) The State shall submit a cost allocation plan for the State 
agency as required below to the Director, Division of Cost Allocation 
(DCA), in the approporiate HHS Regional Office. The plan shall:
    (1) Describe the procedures used to identify, measure, and allocate 
all costs to each of the programs operated by the State agency;
    (2) Conform to the accounting principles and standards prescribed in 
Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, and other pertinent 
Department regulations and instructions;
    (3) Be compatible with the State plan for public assistance programs 
described in 45 CFR Chapter II, III and XIII, and 42 CFR Chapter IV 
Subchapters C and D; and
    (4) Contain sufficient information in such detail to permit the 
Director, Division of Cost Allocation, after consulting with the 
Operating Divisions, to make an informed judgment on the correctness and 
fairness of the State's procedures for identifying, measuring, and 
allocating all costs to each of the programs operated by the State 
agency.
    (b) The cost allocation plan shall contain the following 
information:
    (1) An organizational chart showing the placement of each unit whose 
costs are charged to the programs operated by the State agency.
    (2) A listing of all Federal and all non-Federal programs performed, 
administered, or serviced by these organizational units.
    (3) A description of the activities performed by each organizational 
unit and, where not self-explanatory an explanation of the benefits 
provided to Federal programs.
    (4) The procedures used to identify, measure, and allocate all costs 
to each benefiting program and activity (including activities subject to 
different rates of FFP).
    (5) The estimated cost impact resulting from the proposed changes to 
a previously approved plan. These estimated costs are required solely to 
permit an evaluation of the procedures used for identifying, measuring, 
and allocating costs. Therefore, approval of the cost allocation plan 
shall not constitute approval of these estimated costs for use in 
calculating claims for FFP. Where it is impractical to obtain this data, 
an alternative approach should then be negotiated with the Director, 
DCA, prior to submission of the cost allocation plan.
    (6) A statement stipulating that wherever costs are claimed for 
services provided by a governmental agency outside the State agency, 
that they will be supported by a written agreement that includes, at a 
minimum (i) the specific service(s) being purchased, (ii) the basis upon 
which the billing will be made by the provider agency (e.g. time 
reports, number of homes inspected, etc.) and (iii) a stipulation that 
the billing will be based on the actual cost incurred. This statement 
would not be required if the costs involved are specifically addressed 
in a State-wide cost allocation plan, local-wide cost allocation plan, 
or an umbrella/department cost allocation plan.
    (7) If the public assistance programs are administered by local 
government agencies under a State supervised system, the overall State 
agency cost allocation plan shall also include a cost allocation plan 
for the local agencies. It shall be developed in accordance with the 
requirements set forth above. More than one local agency plan shall be 
submitted if the accounting systems or other conditions at the local 
agencies preclude an equitable allocation of costs by the submission of 
a single plan for all local agencies. Prior to submitting multiple plans 
for local agencies, the State should consult with the Director, DCA. 
Where more than one local agency plan is submitted, the State shall 
identify the specific local agencies covered by each plan.
    (8) A certification by a duly authorized official of the State 
stating:
    (i) That the information contained in the proposed cost allocation 
plan was prepared in conformance with Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-87.

[[Page 463]]

    (ii) That the costs are accorded consistent treatment through the 
application of generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to 
the circumstances.
    (iii) That an adequate accounting and statistical system exists to 
support claims that will be made under the cost allocation plan; and
    (iv) That the information provided in support of the proposed cost 
allocation plan is accurate.
    (9) Other information as is necessary to establish the validity of 
the procedures used to identify, measure, and allocate costs to all 
programs being operated by the State agency.

<R05>
Sec. 95.509  Cost allocation plan amendments and certifications.

    (a) The State shall promptly amend the cost allocation plan and 
submit the amended plan to the Director, DCA if any of the following 
events occur:
    (1) The procedures shown in the existing cost allocation plan become 
outdated because of organizational changes, changes in Federal law or 
regulations, or significant changes in program levels, affecting the 
validity of the approved cost allocation procedures.
    (2) A material defect is discovered in the cost allocation plan by 
the Director, DCA or the State.
    (3) The State plan for public assistance programs is amended so as 
to affect the allocation of costs.
    (4) Other changes occur which make the allocation basis or 
procedures in the approval cost allocation plan invalid.
    (b) If a State has not submitted a plan or plan amendment during a 
given State fiscal year, an annual statement shall be submitted to the 
Director, DCA certifying that its approved cost allocation plan is not 
outdated. This statement shall be submitted within 60 days after the end 
of that fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 95.511  Approval of the cost allocation plan or plan amendment.

    (a) The Director, DCA, after consulting with the affected Operating 
Divisions, shall notify the State in writing of his/her findings. This 
notification will be made within 60 days after receipt of the proposed 
plan or amendment and shall either: (1) Advise the State that the plan 
or plan amendment is approved or disapproved, (2) advise the State of 
the changes required to make the plan or amendment acceptable, or (3) 
request the State to provide additional information needed to evaluate 
the proposed plan or amendment. If the DCA cannot make a determination 
within the 60-day period, it shall so advise the State.
    (b) For purpose of this subpart, State agency cost allocation plans 
which have been approved by an authorized official of the Department of 
HHS prior to the effective date of this regulation are considered 
approved until such time as a new plan or plan amendment is required by 
Sec. 95.509(a).


<R05>
Sec. 95.515  Effective date of a cost allocation plan amendment.

    As a general rule, the effective date of a cost allocation plan 
amendment shall be the first day of the calendar quarter following the 
date of the event that required the amendment (See Sec. 95.509). 
However, the effective date of the amendment may be earlier or later 
under the following conditions:
    (a) An earlier date is needed to avoid a significant inequity to 
either the State or the Federal Government.
    (b) The information provided by the State which was used to approve 
a previous plan or plan amendment is later found to be materially 
incomplete or inaccurate, or the previously approved plan is later found 
to violate a Federal statute or regulation. In either situation, the 
effective date of any required modification to the plan will be the same 
as the effective date of the plan or plan amendment that contained the 
defect.
    (c) It is impractical for the State to implement the amendment on 
the first day of the next calendar quarter. In these instances, a later 
date may be established by agreement between the State and the DCA.

<R05>
Sec. 95.517  Claims for Federal financial participation.

    (a) A State must claim FFP for costs associated with a program only 
in accordance with its approved cost allocation plan. However, if a 
State has submitted a plan or plan amendment for a State agency, it may, 
at its option claim FFP based on the proposed plan or plan amendment, 
unless otherwise advised by the DCA. However, where a State has claimed 
costs based on a proposed plan or plan amendment the State, if 
necessary, shall retroactively adjust its claims in accordance with the 
plan or amendment as subsequently approved by the Director, DCA. The 
State may also continue to claim FFP under its existing approved cost 
allocation plan for all costs not affected by the proposed amendment.


<R05>
Sec. 95.519  Cost disallowance.

    If costs under a Public Assistance program are not claimed in 
accordance with the approved cost allocation plan (except as otherwise 
provided in Sec. 95.517), or if the State failed to submit an amended 
cost allocation plan as required by Sec. 95.509, the costs improperly 
claimed will be disallowed.
    (a)(1) If the issue affects the program(s) of only one Operating 
Division and does not affect the programs of other Operating Divisions 
or Federal departments, that Operating Division will determine the 
amount of the disallowance and will also inform the State of its 
opportunity for reconsideration of the determination in accordance with 
the Operating Division's procedures. Prior to issuing the notification, 
however, the Operating Division shall consult with the DCA to ensure 
that the issue does not affect the programs of other Operating Divisions 
or Federal departments.
    (2) If the State wishes to request a reconsideration of the 
Operating Division's determination, it must submit the request in 
accordance with the Operating Division's procedures.
    (b) If the issue affects the programs of more than one Operating 
Division, or Federal department or the State, the Director, DCA, after 
consulting with the Operating Divisions, shall determine the amount 
inappropriately claimed under each program. The Director, DCA will 
notify the State of this determination, of the dollar affect of the 
determination on the claims made under each program, and will inform the 
State of its opportunity for appeal of the determination under 45 CFR 
part 16. The State will subsequently be notified by the appropriate 
Operating Division as to the disposition of the funds in question.

Sec. 95.601  Scope and applicability.

    This subpart prescribes part of the conditions under which the 
Department of Health and Human Services will approve Federal financial 
participation (FFP) at the applicable rates for the costs of automatic 
data processing incurred under an approved State plan for titles I, IV-
A, IV-B, IV-D, IV-E, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), XIX, or XXI of the Social 
Security Act and title IV chapter 2 of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act. The conditions of approval of this subpart add to the statutory and 
regulatory requirements for acquisition of ADP equipment and services 
under the specified titles of the Social Security Act.

[65 FR 33633, May 24, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 95.605  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    Acceptance documents means written evidence of satisfactory 
completion of an approved phase of work or contract, and acceptance 
thereof by the State agency.
    Acquisition means acquiring ADP equipment or services from 
commercial sources or from State or local government resources.

[[Page 465]]

    Advance Planning Document (APD), Initial advance automatic data 
processing planning document or Initial APD means a written plan of 
action to request funding approval for a project which will require the 
use of ADP services or equipment. The term APD refers to a Planning APD, 
or to a planning and/or, development and implementation action document, 
i.e., Implementation APD, or to an Advance Planning Document Update.
    (1) Planning APD means a written plan of action which requests FFP 
to determine the need for, feasibility, and cost factors of an APD 
equipment or services acquisition and to perform one or more of the 
following: Prepare a Functional Requirements Specification; assess other 
States' systems for transfer, to the maximum extent possible, of an 
existing system; prepare an Implementation APD; prepare a request for 
proposal (RFP) or develop a General Systems Design (GSD).
    A separate planning effort and Planning APD is generally applicable 
to large enhanced funded Statewide system developments and/or major 
hardware acquisitions. States with large, independent Counties 
requesting funding at the regular match rate for County systems are 
strongly encouraged to do better planning and to submit a Planning APD 
to allow for time and to provide funding for its planning activities. 
Therefore, states must consider the scope and complexity of a project to 
determine whether to submit a Planning APD as a separate document to HHS 
or whether to combine the two phases of planning and implementation into 
one APD covering both the Planning APD and the Implementation APD 
requirements.
    The Planning APD is a relatively brief document, usually not more 
than 6-10 pages, which must contain:
    (i) A statement of the problem/need in terms of deficiencies in 
existing capabilities, new or changed program requirements or 
opportunities for economies and efficiencies;
    (ii) A project management plan which addresses the planning project 
organization, planning activities/deliverables, State and contractor 
resource needs, planning project procurement activities and schedule;
    (iii) A specific budget for the planning of the project;
    (iv) An estimated total project cost and a prospective State and 
Federal cost distribution, including planning and implementation;
    (v) A commitment to conduct/prepare the needs assessment, 
feasibility study, alternatives analysis, cost benefit analysis, and to 
develop a Functional Requirements Specification and/or a General Systems 
Design (GSD); and,
    (vi) A commitment to define the State's functional requirements for 
the purpose of evaluating the transfer of an existing system, including 
the transfer of another State's General System Design, which the State 
may adapt to meet State specific requirements.

Additional Planning APD content requirements, for enhanced funding 
projects are contained in 45 CFR 205.37(a)(1)-(8) and CFR 307.15.
    (2) Implementation APD means a written plan of action to acquire the 
proposed APD services or equipment.
    The Implementation APD shall include:
    (i) The results of the activities conducted under a Planning APD, if 
any;
    (ii) A statement of needs and objectives;
    (iii) A requirements analysis, feasibility study and a statement of 
alternative considerations including, where appropriate, a transfer of 
an existing system and an explanation of why such a transfer is not 
feasible if another alternative is identified;
    (iv) A cost benefit analysis;
    (v) A personnel resource statement indicating availability of 
qualified and adequate staff, including a project director to accomplish 
the project objectives;
    (vi) A detailed description of the nature and scope of the 
activities to be undertaken and the methods to be used to accomplish the 
project;
    (vii) The proposed activity schedule for the project;
    (viii) A proposed budget (including a consideration of all possible 
Implementation APD activity costs, e.g., system conversion, computer 
capacity planning, supplies, training, and miscellaneous ADP expenses) 
for the project;

[[Page 466]]

    (ix) A statement indicating the period of time the State expects to 
use the equipment or system;
    (x) An estimate of prospective cost distribution to the various 
State and Federal funding sources and the proposed procedures for 
distributing costs; and
    (xi) A statement setting forth the security and interface 
requirements to be employed and the system failure and disaster recovery 
procedures available.

Additional requirements, for acquisitions for which the State is 
requesting enhanced funding, are contained at 45 CFR 205.37(a)(1)-(8), 
45 CFR 307.15 and 42 CFR part 433 subpart C.
    (3) Advance Planning Document Update (APDU) means a document 
submitted annually (Annual APDU) to report project status and/or post 
implementation cost-savings, or on an as needed (As Needed APDU) basis 
to request funding approval for project continuation when significant 
project changes are anticipated; for incremental funding authority and 
project continuation when approval is being granted by phase; or to 
provide detailed information on project and/or budget activities.
    (a) The Annual APDU is due 60 days from the Planning APD or 
Implementation APD approved anniversary and includes:
    (i) A reference to the approved APD and all approved changes;
    (ii) A project activity status which reports the status of the past 
year's major project tasks and milestones, addressing the degree of 
completion and tasks/milestones remaining to be completed and discusses 
past and anticipated problems or delays in meeting target dates in the 
approved APD and approved changes to it;
    (iii) A report of all project deliverables completed in the past 
year and degree of completion for unfinished products;
    (iv) A project activity schedule for the remainder of the project;
    (v) A project expenditures status which consists of a detailed 
accounting of all expenditures for project development over the past 
year and an explanation of the differences between projected expenses in 
the approved APD and actual expenditures for the past year;
    (vi) A report of any approved or anticipated changes to the 
allocation basis in the APD's approved cost methodology;
    (vii) A report which compares the estimated cost-savings from the 
State's approved APD to actual cost-benefits to date (in the development 
phase of a project, this may be reported as non-applicable). The 
proportion of costs to savings must remain as projected in the APD. Once 
the State begins operation, either on a pilot basis or under a phased 
approval, the cost-savings shall be submitted 2-5 years after statewide 
operation until the Department determines projected cost savings have 
been achieved.
    (b) The As Needed APDU is defined as a document which requests 
approval for additional funding and/or authority for project 
continuation when significant changes are anticipated; when the project 
is being funded on a phased implementation basis; to clarify project 
information requested as an approval condition of the Planning APD or 
Implementation APD. The As Needed APDU may be submitted anytime as a 
stand-alone funding or project continuation request, or may be submitted 
with the Annual APDU:
    (i) When the State anticipates incremental project expenditures 
(exceeding specified thresholds);
    (ii) When the State anticipates a schedule extension of more than 60 
days for major milestones. For Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
(AFDC) Family Assistance Management Information System (FAMIS)-type 
projects, in accordance with section 402(e)(2)(C) of the Social Security 
Act, any schedule change which affects the State's implementation date 
as specified in the approved APD requires that the Department recover 40 
percent of the amount expended. The Secretary may extend the 
implementation date, if the implementation date is not met because of 
circumstances beyond the State's control. Examples of circumstances 
beyond the State's control are:
    (1) Equipment failure due to physical damage or destruction; or,

[[Page 467]]

    (2) Change imposed by Federal judicial decisions, or by Federal 
legislation or regulations;
    (iii) When the State anticipates major changes in the scope of its 
project, e.g., a change in its procurement plan, procurement activities, 
system concept or development approach;
    (iv) When the State anticipates significant changes to its cost 
distribution methodology or distribution of costs among Federal 
programs; and/or,
    (v) When the State anticipates significant changes to its cost-
benefit projections.

The As needed APDU shall provide supporting documentation to justify the 
need for a change to the approved budget.
    Approving component means an organization within the Department that 
is authorized to approve requests for the acquisition of ADP equipment 
or ADP services. Family Support Administration (FSA) for cash assistance 
for titles I, IV-A, X, XIV, and XVI(AABD); Office of Human Development

service of an expert individual to provide advice on the use of ADP 
software or hardware in developing a State automated management 
information system.
    Data processing means the preparation of source media containing 
data or basic elements of information and the use of such source media 
according to precise rules or procedures to accomplish such operations

    (a) A State can demonstrate to the Department an immediate need to 
acquire ADP equipment or services in order to continue the operation of 
one or more of the Social Security Act programs covered by Subpart F, 
and

[[Page 468]]

    (b) The State can clearly document that the need could not have been 
anticipated or planned for and the State was prevented from following 
the prior approval requirements of Sec. 95.611.
    Enhanced matching rate means the higher than regular rate of FFP 
authorized by Title IV-D, IV-E, and XIX of the Social Security Act for 
acquisition of services and equipment that conform to specific 
requirements designed to improve administration of the Child Support 
Enforcement, Foster Care and Adoption Assistance, and Medicaid programs.
    Enhancement means modifications which change the functions of 
software and hardware beyond their original purposes, not just to 
correct errors or deficiencies which may have been present in the 
software or hardware, or to improve the operational performance of the 
software or hardware.
    Feasibility study means a preliminary study to determine whether it 
is sufficiently probable that effective and efficient use of ADP

other resource requirements which will be necessary to operate the 
system; a description of system performance requirements; and a 
description of the physical and organizational environment in which the 
system will operate including how the system will function within that 
environment (e.g. how workers will interface with the system).
    Project means an automated systems effort undertaken by the State to 
improve the administration and/or operation of one or more of its public 
assistance programs. For example, a State may undertake a comprehensive, 
integrated initiative in support of its AFDC and Medicaid programs' 
intake, eligibility and case management functions. A project may also be 
a less comprehensive activity such as, office automation, enhancements 
to an existing system or an upgrade of computer hardware.

    Regular matching rate means the normal rate of FFP authorized by 
titles IV-A, IV-B, IV-D, IV-E, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), XIX, and XXI of the 
Social Security Act for State and local agency administration of 
programs authorized by those titles.
    Requirements Analysis means determining and documenting the 
information needs and the functional and technical requirements the 
proposed computerized system must meet.
    Service agreement means the document signed by the State or local 
agency and the State or local Central Data Processing facility whenever 
the latter provides data processing services to the former and:
    (a) Identifies those ADP services the Central Data Processing 
facility will provide;
    (b) Includes, preferably as an amendable attachment, a schedule of 
charges for each identified ADP service, and a certification that these 
charges apply equally to all users;
    (c) Includes a description of the method(s) of accounting for the 
services rendered under the agreement and computing services charges;
    (d) Includes assurances that services provided will be timely and 
satisfactory;

well as access, use and disposal of ADP data will be safeguarded in 
accordance with provisions of 45 CFR 205.50 and 303.21;
    (f) Requires the provider to obtain prior approval pursuant to 45 
CFR 95.611(a) from the Department for ADP equipment and ADP services 
that are acquired from commercial sources primarily to support the 
titles covered by this subpart and requires the provider to comply with 
45 CFR Part 74, Subpart P for procurements related to the service 
agreement. ADP equipment and services are considered to be primarily 
acquired to support the titles covered by this subpart when these titles 
may reasonably be expected to either: Be billed for more than 50 percent 
of the total charges made to all users of the ADP equipment and services 
during the time period covered by the service agreement, or directly 
charged for the total cost of the purchase or lease of ADP equipment or 
services;
    (g) Includes the beginning and ending dates of the period of time 
covered by the service agreement; and
    (h) Includes a schedule of expected total charges to the title 
covered by this subpart for the period of the service agreement.
    Software means a set of computer programs, procedures, and 
associated documentation used to operate the hardware.

administration of the State plan under titles I, IV, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), 
XIX or XXI of the Social Security Act.
    System specifications means information about the new ADP system--
such as workload descriptions, input data, information to be maintained 
and processed, data processing techniques, and output data--which is 
required to determine the ADP equipment and software necessary to 
implement the system design.
    System study means the examination of existing information flow and 
operational procedures within an organization. The study essentially 
consists of three basic phases: Data gathering investigation of the 
present system and new information requirements; analysis of the data 
gathered in the investigation; and synthesis, or refitting of the parts 
and relationships uncovered through the analysis into an efficient 
system.

    (A) A projected cost increase of $1,000,000 or more.

[[Page 471]]

    (B) A schedule extension of more than 60 days for major milestones;
    (C) A significant change in procurement approach, and/or scope of 
procurement activities beyond that approved in the APD;
    (D) A change in system concept, or a change to the scope of the 
project;
    (E) A change to the approved cost allocation methodology.

The State shall submit the ``As Needed APDU'' to the Department, no 
later than 60 days after the occurrence of the project changes to be 
reported in the ``As Needed APDU''.
    (2) For enhanced FFP requests.
    (i) For an Annual APDU.
    (ii) For an ``As needed'' APDU when changes cause any of the 
following:
    (A) A projected cost increase of $100,000 or 10 percent of the 
project cost, whichever is less;
    (B) A schedule extension of more than 60 days for major milestones. 
For Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Family Assistance 
Management Information System (FAMIS)-type projects, in accordance with 
section 402(e)(2)(C) of the Social Security Act, any schedule change 
which affects the State's implementation date as specified in the 
approved APD requires that the Department recover 40 percent of the 
amount expended. The Secretary may extend the implementation date, if 
the implementation date is not met because of circumstances beyond the

<R05>
Sec. 95.631  Cost identification for purpose of FFP claims.

    The conditions of this subpart apply notwithstanding the existence 
of an approved cost allocation plan. State agencies shall assign and 
claim the costs incurred under an approved APD in accordance with the 
following criteria:
    (a) Development costs. (1) Using its normal departmental accounting 
system, the State agency shall specifically identify what items of costs 
constitute development costs, assign these costs to specific project 
cost centers, and distribute these costs to funding sources based on the 
specific identification, assignment and distribution outlined in the 
approved APD; (2) the methods for distributing costs set forth in the 
APD should provide for assigning identifiable costs, to the extent 
practicable, directly to program/functions. The State agency shall amend 
the cost allocation plan required by Subpart E of this part to include 
the approved APD methodology for the identification, assignment and 
distribution of the development costs.
    (b) Operational costs. Costs incurred for the operation of an ADP 
system shall be identified and assigned by the State agency to funding 
sources in accordance with the approved cost allocation plan required by 
Subpart E of this part.
    (c) Service agreement costs. States that operate a central data 
processing facility shall use their approved central service cost 
allocation plan required by

[[Page 475]]

OMB Circular A-87 to identify and assign costs incurred under service 
agreements with the State agency. The State agency will then distribute 
these costs to funding sources in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 95.701  Purpose and scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart prescribes requirements concerning the computation 
of claims for Federal financial participation in the cost of equipment 
under public assistance programs. This subpart also prescribes 
requirements for the management and disposition of equipment whose costs 
are claimed for Federal financial participation under these programs.
    (b) This subpart applies to equipment purchased by State agencies 
(as defined in Sec. 95.703) and to equipment purchased under service 
agreements with other State agencies and under cost-type contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 95.703  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
equipment usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other 
charges such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective intransit insurance shall be included in or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the regular accounting 
practices of the organization purchasing the equipment. If the item is 
acquired by trading in another item and paying an additional amount, 
acquisition cost means the amount received for trade-in plus the 
additional outlay.
    Equipment means an article of tangible personal property that has a 
useful life of more than two years and an acquisition cost of $500 or 
more. Any recipient may use its own definition of equipment, if its 
definition would at least include all items of equipment as defined 
here.
    Public Assistance Programs means programs authorized by titles I, 
IV-A, IV-B, IV-C, IV-D, IV-E, X, XIV, XVI (AABD), XIX and XXI of the 
Social Security Act, and programs authorized by the Immigration and 
Nationality Act as amended by the Refugee Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-212).
    State means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana 
Islands and Guam.
    State Agency means the State agency administering a public 
assistance program(s). This term includes local government public 
assistance agencies which administer public assistance programs under a 
State supervised system and the State agencies which supervise the local 
agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 95.705  Equipment costs--Federal financial participation.

    (a) General rule. In computing claims for Federal financial 
participation,

[[Page 476]]

equipment having a unit acquisition cost of $25,000 or less may be 
claimed in the period acquired or depreciated, at the option of the 
State agency. Equipment having a unit acquisition cost of more than 
$25,000 shall be depreciated. For purposes of this section, the term 
depreciate also includes use allowances computed in accordance with the 
cost principles precribed in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Equipment purchased under service agreements 
with other State agencies and under cost-type contracts shall be 
depreciated. However, equipment having a unit acquisition cost of 
$25,000 or less may be claimed in the period acquired if (a) the State 
agency approved the specific purchase and the claiming of the cost of 
the item, and (b) the contract or service agreement requires that the 
equipment or its residual value be transferred to the State agency when 
the equipment is no longer needed to carry out the work under the 
contract or service agreement.
    (2) Reimbursement for ADP equipment having an acquisition cost in 
excess of $25,000 and subject to subpart F of this part must be 
depreciated over its useful life unless otherwise specifically provided 
for by the Department. ADP equipment not subject to subpart F is subject 
to the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 95.707  Equipment management and disposition.

    (a) An item of equipment is subject to the property rules in subpart 
O of 45 CFR part 74 if the total cost of the item was claimed in the 
period acquired and if the item was accepted for Federal financial 
participation as a direct cost under a single program or program 
activity. These rules also apply to ADP equipment where the State agency 
was permitted under Subpart F of this part to claim the total cost of 
the equipment in the period acquired.
    (b) Other items of equipment whose costs are claimed for Federal 
financial participation (i.e., equipment that is capitalized and 
depreciated or is claimed in the period acquired and charged to more 
than one program) are not subject to the specific requirements in 
subpart O of 45 CFR part 74. However, the State agency is responsible 
for adequately managing the equipment, maintaining records on the 
equipment, and taking periodic physical inventories. Physical 
inventories may be made on the basis of statistical sampling. The 
following requirements apply to the disposition of this equipment:
    (1) If the cost of the equipment was claimed in the period acquired 
and the equipment is later sold, the proceeds of the sale shall be 
credited to current expenditures in approximate proportion to the 
distribution of the equipment's cost.
    (2) If the cost of the equipment was claimed in the period acquired 
and the equipment is later transferred to an activity which is not 
involved in the performance of programs currently or previously funded 
by the Federal Government, an amount equal to the fair market value of 
the equipment on the date of the transfer shall be credited to current 
expenditures in approximate proportion to the distribution of the 
equipment's costs.
    (3) If the cost of the equipment was claimed in the period acquired 
and the equipment is later traded in on other equipment claims for 
Federal financial participation in the costs of replacement equipment 
shall be limited to the additional outlay.
    (4) If the equipment was depreciated, any gain or loss on the 
disposition of the equipment shall be treated as a decrease or an 
increase to the depreciation expense of the period in which the 
disposition takes place. This provision does not apply to equipment 
whose costs were claimed for Federal financial participation through use 
allowances.

                      Subpart B--General Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 96.10  Prerequisites to obtain block grant funds.

    (a) Except where prescribed elsewhere in this rule or in authorizing 
legislation, no particular form is required for a State's application or 
the related submission required by the statute. For the maternal and 
child health block grant, the application shall be in the form specified 
by the Secretary, as provided by section 505(a) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 705(a)).
    (b) The certifications required by the community services, primary 
care, preventive health and health services, alcohol and drug abuse and 
mental

[[Page 479]]

health services, and low-income home energy assistance block grant 
statutes to be made by the State's chief executive officer must be made 
by that individual personally, or by an individual authorized to make 
such certifications on behalf of the chief executive officer.
    (c) Effective beginning in fiscal year 2001, submission dates for 
applications under the social service and low-income home energy 
assistance block grant programs are:
    (1) for the social services block grant, States and territories 
which operate on a Federal fiscal year basis, and make requests for 
funding from the Department, must insure that their applications (pre-
expenditure reports) for funding are submitted by September 1 of the 
preceding fiscal year unless the Department agrees to a later date. 
States and territories which operate their social services block grant 
on a July 1-June 30 basis, must insure that their applications are 
submitted by June 1 of the preceding funding period unless the 
Department agrees to a later date.
    (2) for the low-income home energy assistance program, States and 
territories which make requests for funding from the Department must 
insure that their applications for a fiscal year are submitted by 
September 1 of the preceding fiscal year unless the Department agrees to 
a later date.
    (d) Effective beginning in fiscal year 2001, for the low-income home 
energy assistance program, States and territories which make requests 
for funding from the Department must insure that all information 
necessary to complete their applications is received by December 15 of 
the fiscal year for which they are requesting funds unless the 
Department agrees to a later date.

[47 FR 29486, July 6, 1982, as amended at 64 FR 55856, Oct. 15, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 96.11  Basis of award to the States.

    The Secretary will award the block grant funds allotted to the State 
in accordance with the apportionment of funds from the Office of 
Management and Budget. Such awards will reflect amounts reserved for 
Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations and, in FY 1982, any amounts 
awarded by the Department under transition authorities. The grant award 
constitutes the authority to carry out the program and to draw and 
expend funds.

[47 FR 29486, July 6, 1982; 47 FR 43062, Sept. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 96.12  Grant payment.

    The Secretary will make payments at such times and in such amounts 
to each State from its awards in advance or by way of reimbursement in 
accordance with section 203 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (42 
U.S.C. 4213) and Treasury Circular No. 1075 (31 CFR Part 205). When 
matching funds are involved, the Secretary shall take into account the 
ratio that such payment bears to such State's total expenditures under 
its awards.


<R05>
Sec. 96.13  Reallotments.

    The Secretary will re-allot to eligible States those funds available 
as of September 1 of each fiscal year under the reallotment provisions 
pertaining to the alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services, 
maternal and child health services, and preventive health and health 
services block grants. The reallotment procedure for the low-income home 
energy assistance block grant is specified in section 2607 of the 
Reconciliation Act (42 U.S.C. 8626) and Sec. 96.81 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 96.14  Time period for obligation and expenditure of grant funds.

    (a) Obligations. Amounts unobligated by the State at the end of the 
fiscal year in which they were first allotted shall remain available for 
obligation during the succeeding fiscal year for all block grants 
except:
    (1) Primary care. Amounts are available only if the Secretary 
determines that the State acted in accordance with section 1926(a)(1) of 
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300y-5(a)(1)) and there is good 
cause for funds remaining unobligated.
    (2) Low-income home energy assistance. Regular LIHEAP block grant 
funds authorized under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 
8621(b)) are available only in accordance with section 2607(b)(2)(B) of 
Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626(b)(2)(B)), as follows. From allotments 
for fiscal year 1982 through

[[Page 480]]

fiscal year 1984, a maximum of 25 percent may be held available for the 
next fiscal year. From allotments for fiscal year 1985 through fiscal 
year 1990, a maximum of 15 percent of the amount payable to a grantee 
and not transferred to another block grant according to section 2604(f) 
of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8623(f)) may be held available for the 
next fiscal year. From allotments for fiscal year 1991 through fiscal 
year 1993, a maximum of 10 percent of the amount payable to a grantee 
and not transferred to another block grant according to section 2604(f) 
of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8623(f)) may be held available for the 
next fiscal year. Beginning with allotments for fiscal year 1994, a 
maximum of 10 percent of the amount payable to a grantee may be held 
available for the next fiscal year. No funds may be obligated after the 
end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which they were 
allotted.
    (b) Expenditure. No limitations exist on the time for expenditure of 
block grant funds, except those imposed by statute with respect to the 
community services, maternal and child health services, and social 
services block grants.

[47 FR 29486, July 6, 1982; 47 FR 43062, Sept. 30, 1982, as amended at 
52 FR 37965, Oct. 13, 1987; 60 FR 21357, May 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 96.15  Waivers.

    Applications for waivers that are permitted by statute for the block 
grants should be submitted to the Director, Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention in the case of the preventive health and health services 
block grant; to the Administrator, Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration in the case of the community mental health 
services block grant and the substance abuse prevention and treatment 
block grant; to the Director, Maternal and Child Health Bureau in the 
case of the maternal and child health services block grant; and to the 
Director, Office of Community Services in the case of the community 
services block grant, the low-income home energy assistance program and 
the social services block grant. Beginning with fiscal year 1986, the 
Secretary's authority to waive the provisions of section 2605(b) of 
Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)) under the low-income home energy 
assistance program is repealed.

[64 FR 55856, Oct. 15, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 96.16  Applicability of title XVII of the Reconciliation Act 
(31 U.S.C. 7301-7305).

    This section interprets the applicability of the general provisions 
governing block grants set forth in title XVII of the Reconciliation Act 
(31 U.S.C. 7301-7305):
    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section or unless 
inconsistent with provisions in the individual block grant statutes, 31 
U.S.C. 7301-7305 apply to the community services, preventive health and 
health services, and alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services 
block grants.
    (b) The requirement in 31 U.S.C. 7303(b) relating to public hearings 
does not apply to any of the block grants governed by this part. 
Instead, the provisions in the individual block grant statutes apply.
    (c) The maternal and child health services block grant is not 
subject to any requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7301-7305.
    (d) The social services and low-income home energy assistance 
programs are subject only to 31 U.S.C. 7304.
    (e) The audit provisions of 31 U.S.C. 7305 have, in most cases, been 
overridden by the Single Audit Act. Pub. L. 98-502, 31 U.S.C. 75, et 
seq., and do not apply to the block grants. Pursuant to Sec. 
96.31(b)(2), certain entities may, however, elect to conduct audits 
under the block grant audit provisions. For entities making this 
election, the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 7305 apply to the community 
services block grant.
    (f) The applicability of 31 U.S.C. 7303(a) relating to the contents 
of a report on proposed uses of funds is specified in Sec. 96.10.

[52 FR 37966, Oct. 13, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 96.17  Annual reporting requirements.

    (a) Except for the low-income home energy assistance program 
activity reports, a state must make public and submit to the Department 
each annual report required by statute:
    (1) Within six months of the end of the period covered by the 
report; or

[[Page 481]]

    (2) At the time the state submits its application for funding for 
the federal or state fiscal year, as appropriate, which begins 
subsequent to the expiration of that six-month period.
    (b) These reports are required annually for preventive health and 
health services (42 U.S.C. 300w-5(a)(1)), community mental health 
services (42 U.S.C. 300x et. seq.), the prevention and treatment of 
substance abuse block grant (42 U.S.C. 300x-21 et. seq.), maternal and 
child health services (42 U.S.C. 706(a)(1)), and the social services 
block grant (42 U.S.C. 1397e(a)). See Sec. 96.82 for requirements 
governing the submission of activity reports for the low-income home 
energy assistance program.

                     Subpart C--Financial Management


<R05>
Sec. 96.30  Fiscal and administrative requirements.

    (a) Fiscal control and accounting procedures. Except where otherwise 
required by Federal law or regulation, a State shall obligate and expend 
block grant funds in accordance with the laws and procedures applicable 
to the obligation and expenditure of its own funds. Fiscal control and 
accounting procedures must be sufficient to (a) permit preparation of 
reports required by the statute authorizing the block grant and (b) 
permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditure adequate to 
establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of the statute authorizing the block 
grant.
    (b) Financial summary of obligation and expenditure of block grant 
funds--(1) Block grants containing time limits on both the obligation 
and the expenditure of funds. After the close of each statutory period 
for the obligation of block grant funds and after the close of each 
statutory period for the expenditure of block grant funds, each grantee 
shall report to the Department:
    (i) Total funds obligated and total funds expended by the grantee 
during the applicable statutory periods; and
    (ii) The date of the last obligation and the date of the last 
expenditure.
    (2) Block grants containing time limits only on obligation of funds. 
After the close of each statutory period for the obligation of block 
grant funds, each grantee shall report to the Department:
    (i) Total funds obligated by the grantee during the applicable 
statutory period; and
    (ii) The date of the last obligation.
    (3) Block grants containing time limits only on expenditure of 
funds. After the close of each statutory period for the expenditure of 
block grant funds, each grantee shall report to the Department:
    (i) Total funds expended by the grantee during the statutory period; 
and
    (ii) The date of the last expenditure.
    (4) Submission of information. Grantees shall submit the information 
required by paragraph (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section on OMB 
Standard Form 269A, Financial Status Report (short form). Grantees are 
to provide the requested information within 90 days of the close of the 
applicable statutory grant periods.

[47 FR 29486, July 6, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 37966, Oct. 13, 1987; 53 
FR 11656, Apr. 8, 1988; 64 FR 55857, Oct. 15, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 96.31  Audits.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
State, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted Government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, expending $300,000 or more (or 
other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year, 
shall:
    (1) Determine whether subgrantees have met the audit requirements of 
the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and 
governmental organizations) providing goods

[[Page 482]]

and services to State and local governments are not required to have a 
single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own 
procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied with laws and 
regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the 
subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instances of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.

[62 FR 45963, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 96.32  Financial settlement.

    The State must repay to the Department amounts found after audit 
resolution to have been expended improperly. In the event that repayment 
is not made voluntarily, the Department will undertake recovery.

[52 FR 37966, Oct. 13, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 96.33  Referral of cases to the Inspector General.

    State or tribal officials who have information indicating the 
commission or potential commission of fraud or other offenses against 
the United States involving block grant funds should promptly provide 
the information to the appropriate Regional Office of Investigations of 
the Department's Office of the Inspector General.

[52 FR 37966, Oct. 13, 1987]


<R04>
   Subpart D--Direct Funding of Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations


<R05>
Sec. 96.40  Scope.

    This subpart applies to the community services, alcohol and drug 
abuse and mental health services, preventive health and health services, 
primary care, and low-income home energy assistance block grants.


<R05>
Sec. 96.41  General determination.

    (a) The Department has determined that, with the exception of the 
circumstances addressed in paragraph (c) of this section, Indian tribes 
and tribal organizations would be better served by means of grants 
provided directly by the Department to such tribes and organizations out 
of their State's allotment of block grant funds than if the State were 
awarded its entire allotment. Accordingly, with the exception of 
situations described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Department 
will, upon request of an eligible Indian tribe or tribal organization 
and where provided for by statute, reserve a portion of the allotment of 
the State(s) in which the tribe is located, and, upon receipt of a 
complete application and related submission meeting statutory and 
regulatory requirements, grant it directly to the tribe or organization.
    (b) An Indian tribe or tribal organization may request direct 
funding under a block grant program included in this subpart regardless 
of whether the State in which it is located is receiving funds under the 
block grant program.
    (c) The Department has determined that Indian tribal members 
eligible for the funds or services provided through the block grants 
would be better served by the State(s) in which the tribe is located 
rather than by the tribe, where:
    (1) The tribe has not used its block grant allotment substantially 
in accordance with the provisions of the relevant statute(s); and
    (2) Following the procedures of 45 CFR 96.51, the Department has 
withheld tribal funds because of those deficiencies; and

[[Page 483]]

    (3) The tribe has not provided sufficient evidence that it has 
removed or corrected the reason(s) for withholding. In these cases, 
block grant funds reserved or set aside for a direct grant to the Indian 
tribe will be awarded to the State(s), and the State(s) will provide 
block grant services to the service population of the tribe. Before 
awarding these funds to the State(s), the Department will allow as much 
time as it determines to be reasonable for the tribe to correct the 
conditions that led to withholding, consistent with provision of timely 
and meaningful services to the tribe's service population during the 
fiscal year. If a State(s) is awarded funds under this paragraph, the 
State(s) will receive all remaining funds set aside for the tribe for 
the Federal fiscal year for which the award is made. Where the 
Department has withheld funds from a tribe and the tribe has not taken 
satisfactory corrective action by the first day of the following fiscal 
year, all of the funds to serve the tribe's service population for the 
following fiscal year will be awarded to the State(s). The State(s) is 
responsible for providing services to the service population of the 
tribe in these cases. This paragraph also applies when funds are 
withheld from a tribal organization.

[47 FR 29486, July 6, 1982, as amended at 64 FR 55857, Oct. 15, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 96.42  General procedures and requirements.

    (a) An Indian tribe or tribal organization applying for or receiving 
direct funding from the Secretary under a block grant program shall be 
subject to all statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to a 
State applying for or receiving block grant funds to the extent that 
such requirements are relevant to an Indian tribe or tribal organization 
except where otherwise provided by statute or in this part.
    (b) A tribal organization representing more than one Indian tribe 
will be eligible to receive block grant funds on behalf of a particular 
tribe only if the tribe has by resolution authorized the organization's 
action.
    (c) If an Indian tribe or tribal organization whose service 
population resides in more than one State applies for block grant funds 
that, by statute, are apportioned on the basis of population, the 
allotment awarded to the tribe or organization shall be taken from the 
allotments of the various States in which the service population resides 
in proportion to the number of eligible members or households to be 
served in each State. If block grant funds are required to be 
apportioned on the basis of grants during a base year, the allotment to 
the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be taken from the 
allotment of the State whose base year grants included the relevant 
grants to the tribe or organization.
    (d) The audit required under the block grant programs shall be 
conducted by an entity that is independent of the Indian tribe or tribal 
organization receiving grant funds from the Secretary.
    (e) Beginning with fiscal year 1983, any request by an Indian tribe 
or tribal organization for direct funding by the Secretary must be 
submitted to the Secretary, together with the required application and 
related materials, by September 1 preceding the Federal fiscal year for 
which funds are sought. A separate application is required for each 
block grant. After the September 1 deadline, tribal applications will be 
accepted only with the concurrence of the State (or States) in which the 
tribe or tribal organization is located.
    (f) A State receiving block grant funds is not required to use those 
funds to provide tangible benefits (e.g., cash or goods) to Indians who 
are within the service population of an Indian tribe or tribal 
organization that received direct funding from the Department under the 
same block grant program for the same fiscal year. A State, however, may 
not deny Indians access to intangible services funded by block grant 
programs (e.g., treatment at a community health center) even if the 
Indians are members of a tribe receiving direct funding for a similar 
service. A tribe receiving direct block grant funding is not required to 
use those funds to provide tangible benefits to non-Indians living 
within the tribe's service area unless the tribe and the State(s) in

[[Page 484]]

which the tribe is located agree in writing that the tribe will do so.

[47 FR 29486, July 6, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 37966, Oct. 13, 1987; 64 
FR 55857, Oct. 15, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 96.43  Procedures during FY 1982.

    (a) This section applies to the fiscal year beginning October 1, 
1981.
    (b) A request for direct funding must be received by the Secretary 
before the Secretary has awarded all of the allotment to the State 
involved. The application and related submission may be submitted later 
but must be submitted within 75 days after the beginning of the quarter 
in which the State qualified for block grant funds, (or by August 20, 
1982 in the case of an Indian tribe located in a State that has not 
qualified for block grant funds in FY 1982) except that the application 
and related submission for the low-income home energy assistance program 
must be submitted by December 15, 1981. A separate request and 
application are required for each block grant.

<R05>
Sec. 96.44  Community services.

    (a) This section applies to direct funding of Indian tribes and 
tribal organizations under the community services block grant.
    (b) The terms Indian tribe and tribal organization as used in the 
Reconciliation Act have the same meaning given such terms in section 
4(b) and 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act (25 U.S.C. 450b). The terms also include organized groups of Indians 
that the State in which they reside has determined are Indian tribes. An 
organized group of Indians is eligible for direct funding based on State 
recognition if the State has expressly determined that the group is an 
Indian tribe. In addition, the statement of the State's chief executive 
officer verifying that a tribe is recognized by that State will also be 
sufficient to verify State recognition for the purpose of direct 
funding.
    (c) For purposes of section 674(c)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
9903(c)(2)) an eligible Indian means a member of an Indian tribe whose 
income is at or below the poverty line defined in section 673(2) of the

[[Page 485]]

block grant that was specifically targeted toward serving a particular 
Indian tribe or tribal organization will be considered eligible if the 
grantee is an Indian tribe or tribal organization at the time it 
requests funds under this part. Grantees that received funds under 
formula or Statewide grants, and subgrantees that received funds from 
any program replaced by the preventive health and health services block 
grant, are not eligible.


<R05>
Sec. 96.46  Substance abuse prevention and treatment services.

    (a) This section applies to direct funding of Indian tribes and 
tribal organizations under the substance abuse prevention and treatment 
Block Grant.
    (b) For the purpose of determining eligible applicants under section 
1933(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300x-33(d)) an 
Indian tribe or tribal organization (as defined in subsections (b) and 
(c) of section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act) that received a direct grant under subpart I of part B 
of title XIX of the PHS Act (as such existed prior to October 1, 1992) 
in fiscal year 1991 will be considered eligible for a grant under 
subpart 2 of part B of title XIX of the PHS Act.
    (c) For purposes of the substance abuse prevention and treatment 
Block Grant, an Indian tribe or tribal organization is not required to 
comply with the following statutory provisions of the Public Health 
Service Act: 1923 (42 U.S.C. 300x-23), 1925 (42 U.S.C. 300x-25), 1926 
(42 U.S.C. 300x-26), 1928 (42 U.S.C. 300x-28), 1929 (42 U.S.C. 300x-29), 
and 1943(a)(1) (42 U.S.C. 300x-53(a)(1)). An Indian tribe or tribal 
organization is to comply with all other statutes and regulations 
applicable to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. 
In each case in which an Indian Tribe receives a direct grant, the State 
is also responsible for providing services to Native Americans under the 
State's Block Grant program.

Part 51c (Grants for Community Health Services).


<R05>
Sec. 96.48  Low-income home energy assistance.

    (a) This section applies to direct funding of Indian tribes under 
the low-income home energy assistance program.
    (b) The terms Indian tribe and tribal organization as used in the 
Reconciliation Act have the same meaning given such terms in section 
4(b) and 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act (25 U.S.C. 450b) except that the terms shall also include organized 
groups of Indians that the State in which they reside has expressly 
determined are Indian tribes or tribal organizations in accordance with 
State procedures for making such determinations.
    (c) For purposes of section 2604(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 8623(d)), 
an organized group of Indians is eligible for direct funding based on 
State recognition if the State has expressly determined that the group 
is an Indian tribe. A statement by the State's chief executive officer 
verifying that a tribe is recognized by that State will also be 
sufficient to verify State recognition for the purpose of direct 
funding.
    (d) The plan required by section 2604(d)(4) of the Reconciliation 
Act (42 U.S.C. 8623(d)(4)) shall contain the certification and 
information required for States under section 2605 (b) and (c) of that 
Act (42 U.S.C. 8624 (b) and (c)). An Indian tribe or tribal organization 
is not required to comply with section 2605(a)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
8624(a)(2)).

provide energy assistance for tribal members, as provided by section 
2604(d)(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 8623(d)(3)), the Secretary shall 
consider the following factors in selecting the grantee: the ability of 
the other entity to provide low-income home energy assistance, existing 
tribal-State agreements as to the size and location of the service 
population, and the history of State services to the Indian people to be 
served by the other entity.

Sec. 96.49  Due date for receipt of all information required for completion 
of tribal applications for the low-income home energy assistance block grants.

    Effective beginning in FY 2001, for the low-income home energy 
assistance program, Indian tribes and tribal organizations that make 
requests for direct funding from the Department must insure that all 
information necessary to complete their application is received by 
December 15 of the fiscal year for which funds are requested, unless the 
State(s) in which the tribe is located agrees to a later date. After 
December 15, funds will revert to the State(s) in which the tribe is 
located, unless the State(s) agrees to a later date. If funds revert to 
a State, the State is responsible for providing low-income home energy 
assistance program services to the service population of the tribe.

                         Subpart E--Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 96.50  Complaints.

    (a) This section applies to any complaint (other than a complaint 
alleging violation of the nondiscrimination provisions) that a State has 
failed to use its allotment under a block grant in accordance with the 
terms of the act establishing the block grant or the certifications and 
assurances made by the State pursuant to that act. The Secretary is not 
required to consider a complaint unless it is submitted as required by 
this section.
    (b) Complaints with respect to the health block grants must be 
submitted in writing to either the Assistant Secretary for Health or: 
For the preventive health and health services block grant, the Director, 
Centers for Disease Control; for the alcohol and drug abuse and mental 
health services block grant, the Administrator, Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and 
Mental Health Administration; for the maternal and child health services 
block grant, the Administrator, Health Resources and Services 
Administration. Complaints with respect to the social services block 
grant must be submitted in writing to the Assistant Secretary for Human 
Development Services. Complaints with respect to the low-income home 
energy assistance program and the community services block grant must be 
submitted in writing to the Director, Office of Community Services. (The 
address for the Director, Center for Disease Control is 1600 Clifton 
Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333. For each of the other officials cited 
above the address is 200 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20201.) 
The complaint must identify the provision of the act, assurance, or 
certification that was allegedly violated; must specify the basis for 
the violations it charges; and must include all relevant information 
known to the person submitting it.
    (c) The Department shall promptly furnish a copy of any complaint to 
the affected State. Any comments received from the State within 60 days 
(or such longer period as may be agreed upon between the State and the 
Department) shall be considered by the Department in responding to the 
complaint. The Department will conduct an investigation of complaints 
where appropriate.
    (d) The Department will provide a written response to complaints 
within 180 days after receipt. If a final resolution cannot be provided 
at that time, the response will state the reasons why additional time is 
necessary. Under the low-income home energy assistance program, within 
60 days after receipt of complaints, the Department will provide a 
written response to the complainant, stating the actions that it has 
taken to date and, if the complaint has not yet been fully resolved, the 
timetable for final resolution of the complaint.
    (e) The Department recognizes that under the block grant programs 
the States are primarily responsible for interpreting the governing 
statutory provisions. As a result, various States may reach different 
interpretations of the same statutory provisions. This circumstance is 
consistent with the intent of and statutory authority for the block 
grant programs. In resolving any issue raised by a complaint or a 
Federal audit the Department will defer to a State's interpretation of 
its assurances and of the provisions of the block grant statutes unless 
the interpretation is clearly erroneous. In any event,

[[Page 487]]

the Department will provide copies of complaints to the independent 
entity responsible for auditing the State's activities under the block 
grant program involved. Any determination by the Department that a 
State's interpretation is not clearly erroneous shall not preclude or 
otherwise prejudice the State auditors' consideration of the question.

<R05>
Sec. 96.51  Hearings.

    (a) The Department will order a State to repay amounts found not to 
have been expended in accordance with law of the certifications provided 
by the State only after the Department has provided the State notice of 
the order and an opportunity for a hearing. Opportunity for a hearing 
will not be provided, however, when the State, in resolving audit 
findings or at another time, has agreed that the amounts were not 
expended in accordance with law or the certifications. The hearing will 
be governed by Subpart F of this part and will be held in the State if 
required by statute.
    (b) If a State refuses to repay amounts after a final decision that 
is not subject to further review in the Department, the amounts may be 
offset against payments to the State. If a statute requires an 
opportunity for a hearing before such an offset may be made, the hearing 
will be governed by Subpart F of this part and will be held in the State 
if required by statute.
    (c) The Department will withhold funds from a State only if the 
Department has provided the State an opportunity for a hearing. The 
hearing will be governed by Subpart F of this part and will be held in 
the State if required by statute.

Sec. 96.52  Appeals.

    (a) Decisions resulting from repayment hearings held pursuant to 
Sec. 96.51(a) of this part may be appealed by either the State or the 
Department to the Grant Appeals Board.
    (b) Decisions resulting from offset hearings held pursuant to Sec. 
96.51(b) of this part may not be appealed.
    (c) Decisions resulting from withholding hearings held pursuant to 
Sec. 96.51(c) of this part may be appealed to the Secretary by the State 
or the Department as follows:
    (1) An application for appeal must be received by the Secretary no 
later than 60 days after the appealing party receives a copy of the 
presiding officer's decision. The application shall clearly identify the 
questions for which review is sought and shall explain fully the party's 
position with respect to those questions. A copy shall be furnished to 
the other party.
    (2) The Secretary may permit the filing of opposing briefs, hold 
informal conferences, or take whatever other steps the Secretary finds 
appropriate to decide the appeal.
    (3) The Secretary may refer an application for appeal to the Grant 
Appeals Board. Notwithstanding Part 16 of this title, in the event of 
such a referral, the Board shall issue a recommended decision that will 
not become final until affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Secretary.
    (d) Any appeal to the Grant Appeals Board under this section shall 
be governed by Part 16 of this title except that the Board shall not 
hold a hearing. The Board shall accept any findings with respect to 
credibility of witnesses made by the presiding officer. The Board may 
otherwise review and supplement the record as provided for in Part 16 of 
this title and decide the issues raised.


<R05>
Sec. 96.53  Length of withholding.

[[Page 488]]


<R05>
Sec. 96.61  Initiation of hearing.

    (a) A hearing is initiated by a notice of opportunity for hearing 
from the Department. The notice will:
    (1) Be sent by mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any 
other mode of written communication;
    (2) Specify the facts and the action that are the subject of the 
opportunity for a hearing;
    (3) State that the notice of opportunity for hearing and the hearing 
are governed by these rules; and
    (4) State the time within which a hearing may be requested, and 
state the name, address, and telephone number of the Department employee 
to whom any request for hearing is to be addressed.
    (b) A State offered an opportunity for a hearing has the amount of 
time specified in the notice, which may not be less than 10 days after 
receipt of the notice, within which to request a hearing. The request 
may be filed by mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any other 
mode of written communication, addressed to the designated Department 
employee. If no response is filed within that time, the offer is deemed 
to have been refused and no hearing will be held.
    (c) If a hearing is requested, the Department will designate a 
presiding officer, and (subject to Sec. 96.51 of this part) the hearing 
will take place at a time and location agreed upon by the State 
requesting the hearing, the Department, and the presiding officer or, if 
agreement cannot be reached, at a reasonable time and location 
designated by the presiding officer.


<R05>
Sec. 96.62  Presiding officer.

    (a) A Department employee to whom the Secretary delegates such 
authority, or any other agency employee designated by an employee to 
whom such authority is delegated, may serve as the presiding officer and 
conduct a hearing under this subpart.
    (b) The presiding officer is to be free from bias or prejudice and 
may not have participated in the investigation or action that is the 
subject of the hearing or be subordinate to a person, other than the 
Secretary, who has participated in such investigation or action.
    (c) The Secretary is not precluded by this section from prior 
participation in the investigation or action that is the subject of the 
hearing.
    (d) A different presiding officer may be substituted for the one 
originally designated under Sec. 96.61 of this part without notice to 
the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 96.63  Communications to presiding officer.

    (a) Those persons who are directly involved in the investigation or 
presentation of the position of the Department or any party at a hearing 
that is subject to this subpart should avoid any off-the-record 
communication on the matter to the presiding officer or his advisers if 
the communication is inconsistent with the requirement of Sec. 96.68 of 
this part that the administrative record be the exclusive record for 
decision. If any communication of this type occurs, it is to be reduced 
to writing and made part of the record, and the other party provided an 
opportunity to respond.
    (b) A copy of any communications between a participant in the 
hearing and the presiding officer, e.g., a response by the presiding 
officer to a request for a change in the time of the hearing is to be 
sent to all parties by the person initiating the communication.

discovery shall not be allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 96.66  Hearing procedure.

    (a) A hearing is public, except when the Secretary or the presiding 
officer determines that all or part of a hearing should be closed to 
prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (such as 
disclosure of information in medical records that would identify 
patients), to prevent the disclosure of a trade secret or confidential 
commercial or financial information, or to protect investigatory records 
compiled for law enforcement purposes that are not available for public 
disclosure.

[[Page 489]]

    (b) A hearing will be conducted by the presiding officer. Employees 
of the Department will first give a full and complete statement of the 
action which is the subject of the hearing, together with the 
information and reasons supporting it, and may present any oral or 
written information relevant to the hearing. The State may then present 
any oral or written information relevant to the hearing. Both parties 
may confront and conduct reasonable cross-examination of any person 
(except for the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes 
any statement on the matter at the hearing.
    (c) The hearing is informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do 
not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of 
information and views will be made or considered, but either party may 
comment upon or rebut all such data, information, and views.
    (d) The presiding officer may order the hearing to be transcribed. 
The State may have the hearing transcribed, at the State's expense, in 
which case a copy of the transcript is to be furnished to the Department 
at the Department's expense.
    (e) The presiding officer may, if appropriate, allow for the 
submission of post-hearing briefs. The presiding officer shall prepare a 
written decision, which shall be based on a preponderance of the 
evidence, shall include a statement of reasons for the decision, and 
shall be final unless appealed pursuant to Sec. 96.52 of this part. If 
post-hearing briefs were not permitted, the parties to the hearing will 
be given the opportunity to review and comment on the presiding 
officer's decision prior to its being issued.
    (f) The presiding officer shall include as part of the decision a 
finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) 
whenever credibility is a material issue.
    (g) The presiding officer shall furnish a copy of the decision to 
the parties.
    (h) The presiding officer has the power to take such actions and 
make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to maintain order and 
to conduct a fair, expeditious, and impartial hearing, and to enforce 
the requirements of this subpart concerning the conduct of hearings. The 
presiding officer may direct that the hearing be conducted in any 
suitable manner permitted by law and these regulations.
    (i) The Secretary or the presiding officer has the power to suspend, 
modify, or waive any provision of this subpart.

Sec. 96.71  Definitions.

    (a) Section 2005 (a)(2) and (a)(5) (42 U.S.C. 1397d (a)(2) and 
(a)(5)) of the Social Security Act establishes prohibitions against the 
provision of room and board and medical care unless, among other 
reasons, they are an ``integral but subordinate'' part of a State-
authorized social service. ``Integral but subordinate'' means that the 
room and

[[Page 490]]

board provided for a short term or medical care is a minor but essential 
adjunct to the service of which it is a part and is necessary to achieve 
the objective of that service. Room and board provided for a short term 
shall not be considered an integral but subordinate part of a social 
service when it is provided to an individual in a foster family home or 
other facility the primary purpose of which is to provide food, shelter, 
and care or supervision, except for temporary emergency shelter provided 
as a protective service.
    (b) As used in section 2005(a)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1397d (a)(5)) with respect to the limitations governing the 
provision of services by employees of certain institutions, employees 
includes staff, contractors, or other individuals whose activities are 
under the professional direction or direct supervision of the 
institution.

health services, and low-income home energy assistance block grants. In 
addition, funds may be transferred to other Federal block grants for 
support of health services, health promotion and disease prevention 
activities, or low-income home energy assistance (or any combination of 
those activities).

<R05>
Sec. 96.74  Annual reporting requirements.

    (a) Annual report. In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1397e, each state 
must submit an annual report to the Secretary by the due dates specified 
in Sec. 96.17 of this part. The annual report must cover the most 
recently completed fiscal year and, except for the data in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (4) of this section, may be submitted in the format of 
the state's choice. The annual report must address the requirements in 
section 2006(a) of the Act, include the specific data required by 
section 2006(c), and include other information as follows:
    (1) The number of individuals who receive services paid for in whole 
or in part with federal funds under the Social Services Block Grant, 
showing separately the number of children and the number of adults who 
received such services (section 2006(c)(1));
    (2) The amount of Social Services Block Grant funds spent in 
providing each service, showing separately for each service the average 
amount spent per child recipient and per adult recipient (section 
2006(c)(2));
    (3) The total amount of federal, state and local funds spent in 
providing each service, including Social Services Block Grant funds;
    (4) The method(s) by which each service is provided, showing 
separately the services provided by public agencies, private agencies, 
or both (section 2006(c)(4)); and
    (5) The criteria applied in determining eligibility for each service 
such as income eligibility guidelines, sliding fee scales, the effect of 
public assistance benefits, and any requirements for enrollment in 
school or training programs (section 2006(c)(3)).
    (b) Reporting requirement. (1) Each state must use the uniform 
definitions of services in appendix A of this part, categories 1-28, in 
submitting the data required in paragraph (a) of this section. Where a 
state cannot use the uniform definitions, it should report the data 
under category 29, ``Other Services.'' The state's definitions of each 
of the services listed in category 29 must be included in the annual 
report.
    (2) Each state must use the reporting form issued by the Department 
to report the data required in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (3) In reporting recipient and expenditure data, each state must 
report actual numbers of recipients and actual expenditures when this 
information is available. For purposes of this report,

[[Page 491]]

each state should, if possible, count only a single recipient for each 
service. States should also consider a service provided to a recipient 
for the length of the reporting period (one year) or any fraction 
thereof as a single service. Data based on sampling and/or estimates 
will be accepted when actual figures are unavailable. Each state must 
indicate for each service whether the data are based on actual figures, 
sampling, or estimates and must describe the sampling and/or estimation 
process(es) it used to obtain these data in the annual report. Each 
state must also indicate, in reporting recipient data, whether the data 
reflects an unduplicated count of recipients.
    (4) Each state must use category 30, ``Other Expenditures,'' to 
report non-service expenditures. Only total dollar amounts in this 
category are required, i.e., they need not be reported by recipient 
count or cost per adult/child. This will include carry over balances, 
carry forward balances, funds transferred to or from the SSBG program, 
and administrative costs as defined by the state.
    (5) Each state must use its own definition of the terms ``child'' 
and ``adult'' in reporting the data required in paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (5) of this section.
    (6) Each state's definition of ``child'' and ``adult'' must be

          Subpart H--Low-income Home Energy Assistance Program


<R05>
Sec. 96.80  Scope.

    This subpart applies to the low-income home energy assistance 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 96.81  Carryover and reallotment.

    (a) Scope. Pursuant to section 2607(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 
U.S.C. 8626(b)), this section concerns procedures relating to carryover 
and reallotment of regular LIHEAP block grant funds authorized under 
section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)).
    (b) Required carryover and reallotment report. Each grantee must 
submit a report to the Department by August 1 of each year, containing 
the information in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. The 
Department shall make no payment to a grantee for a fiscal year unless 
the grantee has complied with this paragraph with respect to the prior 
fiscal year.
    (1) The amount of funds that the grantee requests to hold available 
for obligation in the next (following) fiscal year, not to exceed 10 
percent of the funds payable to the grantee;
    (2) A statement of the reasons that this amount to remain available 
will not be used in the fiscal year for which it was allotted;
    (3) A description of the types of assistance to be provided with the 
amount held available; and
    (4) The amount of funds, if any, to be subject to reallotment.
    (c) Conditions for reallotment. If the total amount available for 
reallotment for a fiscal year is less than $25,000, the Department will 
not reallot such amount. If the total amount available for reallotment 
for a fiscal year is $25,000 or more, the Department will reallot such 
amount, except that the Department will not award less than $25 in 
reallotted funds to a grantee.

<R05>
Sec. 96.83  Increase in maximum amount that may be used for weatherization 
and other energy-related home repair.

    (a) Scope. This section concerns requests for waivers increasing 
from 15 percent to up to 25 percent of LIHEAP funds allotted or 
available to a grantee for a fiscal year, the maximum amount that 
grantees may use for low-cost residential weatherization and other 
energy-related home repair for low-income households (hereafter referred 
to as ``weatherization''), pursuant to section 2605(k) of Public Law 97-
35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(k)).
    (b) Public inspection and comment. Before submitting waiver requests 
to the Department, grantees must make proposed waiver requests available 
for public inspection within their jurisdictions in a manner that will 
facilitate timely and meaningful review of, and comment upon, these 
requests. Written public comments on proposed waiver requests must be 
made available for public inspection upon their receipt by grantees, as 
must any summaries prepared of written comments, and transcripts and/or 
summaries of verbal comments made on proposed requests at public 
meetings or hearings. Proposed waiver requests, and any preliminary 
waiver requests, must be made available for public inspection and 
comment until at least March 15 of the fiscal year for which the waiver 
is to be requested. Copies of actual waiver requests must be made 
available for public inspection upon submission of the requests to the 
Department.
    (c) Waiver request. After March 31 of each fiscal year, the chief 
executive officer (or his or her designee) may request a waiver of the 
weatherization obligation limit for this fiscal year, if the grantee 
meets criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of 
this section, or can show ``good cause'' for obtaining a waiver despite 
a failure to meet one or more of these criteria. (If the request is made 
by the chief executive officer's designee and the Department does not 
have on file written evidence of the designation, the request also must 
include evidence of the appropriate delegation of authority.) Waiver 
requests must be in writing and must include the information specified 
in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section. The grantee may 
submit a preliminary waiver request for a fiscal year, between February 
1 and March 31 of the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested. If 
a grantee chooses to submit a preliminary waiver request, the 
preliminary request must include the information specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section; in addition, after March 31 the 
chief executive officer (or his or her designee) must submit the 
information specified in paragraphs (c)(7) through (c)(10) of this 
section, to complete the preliminary waiver request.
    (1) A statement of the total percent of its LIHEAP funds allotted or 
available in the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, that the 
grantee desires to use for weatherization.
    (2) A statement of whether the grantee has met each of the following 
three criteria:

[[Page 493]]

    (i) In the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, the 
combined total (aggregate) number of households in the grantee's service 
population that will receive LIHEAP heating, cooling, and crisis 
assistance benefits that are provided from Federal LIHEAP allotments 
from regular and supplemental appropriations will not be fewer than the 
combined total (aggregate) number that received such benefits in the 
preceding fiscal year;
    (ii) In the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, the 
combined total (aggregate) amount, in dollars, of LIHEAP heating, 
cooling, and crisis assistance benefits received by the grantee's 
service population that are provided from Federal LIHEAP allotments from 
regular and supplemental appropriations will not be less than the 
combined total (aggregate) amount received in the preceding fiscal year; 
and
    (iii) All LIHEAP weatherization activities to be carried out by the 
grantee in the fiscal year for which the wavier is requested have been 
shown to produce measurable savings in energy expenditures.
    (3) With regard to criterion in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, 
a statement of the grantee's best estimate of the appropriate household 
totals for the fiscal year for which the wavier is requested and for the 
preceding fiscal year.
    (4) With regard to criterion in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section, a statement of the grantee's best estimate of the appropriate 
benefit totals, in dollars, for the fiscal year for which the waiver is 
requested and for the preceding fiscal year.
    (5) With regard to criterion in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this 
section, a description of the weatherization activities to be carried 
out by the grantee in the fiscal year for which the wavier is requested 
(with all LIHEAP funds proposed to be used for weatherization, not just 
with the amount over 15 percent), and an explanation of the specific 
criteria under which the grantee has determined whether these activities 
have been shown to produce measurable savings in energy expenditures.
    (6) A description of how and when the proposed wavier request was 
made available for timely and meaningful public review and comment, 
copies and/or summaries of public comments received on the request 
(including transcripts and/or summaries of any comments made on the 
request at public meetings or hearings), a statement of the method for 
reviewing public comments, and a statement of the changes, if any, that 
were made in response to these comments.
    (7) To complete a preliminary waiver request: Official confirmation 
that the grantee wishes approval of the waiver request.
    (8) To complete a preliminary waiver request: A statement of whether 
any public comments were received after preparation of the preliminary 
waiver request and, if so, copies and/or summaries of these comments 
(including transcripts and/or summaries of any comments made on the 
request at public meetings or hearings), and a statement of the changes, 
if any, that were made in response to these comments.
    (9) To complete a preliminary waiver request: A statement of whether 
any material/substantive changes of fact have occurred in information 
included in the preliminary waiver request since its submission, and, if 
so, a description of the change(s).
    (10) To complete a preliminary waiver request: A description of any 
other changes to the preliminary request.
    (d) ``Standard'' waiver. If the Department determines that a grantee 
has meet the three criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, has 
provided all information required by paragraph (c) of this section, has 
shown adequate concern for timely and meaningful public review and 
comment, and has proposed weatherization that meets all relevant 
requirements of title XXVI of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.) 
and 45 CFR part 96, the Department will approve a ``standard'' waiver.
    (e) ``Good cause'' waiver. (1) If a grantee does not meet one or 
more of the three criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, then the 
grantee may submit documentation that demonstrates good cause why a 
waiver should be granted despite the grantee's failure to meet this 
criterion or these criteria. ``Good cause'' waiver requests must include 
the following information, in addition

[[Page 494]]

to the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section:
    (i) For each criterion under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that 
the grantee does not meet, an explanation of the specific reasons 
demonstrating good cause why the grantee does not meet the criterion and 
yet proposes to use additional funds for weatherization, citing 
measurable, quantified data, and stating the source(s) of the data used;
    (ii) A statement of the grantee's LIHEAP heating, cooling, and 
crisis assistance eligibility standards (eligibility criteria) and 
benefits levels for the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested 
and for the preceding fiscal year; and, if eligibility standards were 
less restrictive and/or benefit levels were higher in the preceding 
fiscal year for one or more of these program components, an explanation 
of the reasons demonstrating good cause why a waiver should be granted 
in spite of this fact;
    (iii) A statement of the grantee's opening and closing dates for 
applications for LIHEAP heating, cooling, and crisis assistance in the 
fiscal year for which the waiver is requested and in the preceding 
fiscal year, and a description of the grantee's outreach efforts for 
heating, cooling, and crisis assistance in the fiscal year for which the 
waiver is requested and in the preceding fiscal year, and, if the 
grantee's application period was longer and/or outreach efforts were 
greater in the preceding fiscal year for one or more of these program 
components, an explanation of the reasons demonstrating good cause why a 
waiver should be granted in spite of this fact; and
    (iv) If the grantee took, or will take, other actions that led, or 
will lead, to a reduction in the number of applications for LIHEAP 
heating, cooling, and/or crisis assistance, from the preceding fiscal 
year to the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, a description 
of these actions and an explanation demonstrating good cause why a 
waiver should be granted in spite of these actions.
    (2) If the Department determines that a grantee requesting a ``good 
cause'' waiver has demonstrated good cause why a waiver should be 
granted, has provided all information required by paragraphs (c) and 
(e)(1) of this section, has shown adequate concern for timely and 
meaningful public review and comment, and has proposed weatherization 
that meets all relevant requirements of title XXVI of Public Law 97-35 
(42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.) and 45 CFR part 96, the Department will approve 
a ``good cause'' waiver.
    (f) Approvals and disapprovals. After receiving the grantee's 
complete waiver request, the Department will respond in writing within 
45 days, informing the grantee whether the request is approved on either 
a ``standard'' or ``good cause'' basis. The Department may request 
additional information and/or clarification from the grantee. If 
additional information and/or clarification is requested, the 45-day 
period for the Department's response will start when the additional 
information and/or clarification is received. No waiver will be granted 
for a previous fiscal year.
    (g) Effective period. Waivers will be effective from the date of the 
Department's written approval until the funds for which the waiver is 
granted are obligated in accordance with title XXVI of Public Law 97-35 
(42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.) and 45 CFR part 96. Funds for which a 
weatherization waiver was granted that are carried over to the following 
fiscal year and used for weatherization shall not be considered ``funds 
allotted'' or ``funds available'' for the purposes of calculating the 
maximum amount that may be used for weatherization in the succeeding 
fiscal year.

Sec. 96.87  Leveraging incentive program.

    (a) Scope and eligible grantees. (1) This section concerns the 
leveraging incentive program authorized by section 2607A of Public Law 
97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a).
    (2)(i) The only entities eligible to receive leveraging incentive 
funds from the Department are States (including the District of 
Columbia), Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and territories that 
received direct Federal LIHEAP funding under section 2602(b) of Public 
Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) in both the base period for which 
leveraged resources are reported, and the award period for which 
leveraging incentive funds are sought; and tribes and tribal 
organizations described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) Indian tribes that received LIHEAP services under section 
2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) through a directly-
funded tribal organization in the base period for which

[[Page 496]]

leveraged resources are reported, and receive direct Federal LIHEAP 
funding under section 2602(b) in the award period, will receive 
leveraging incentive funds allocable to them if they submit leveraging 
reports meeting all applicable requirements. If the tribal organization 
continues to receive direct funding under section 2602(b) in the award 
period, the tribal organization also will receive incentive funds 
allocable to it if it submits a leveraging report meeting all applicable 
requirements. In such cases, incentive funds will be allocated among the 
involved entities that submit leveraging reports, as agreed by these 
entities. If they cannot agree, HHS will allocate incentive funds based 
on the comparative role of each entity in obtaining and/or administering 
the leveraged resources, and/or their relative number of LIHEAP-eligible 
households.
    (iii) If a tribe received direct Federal LIHEAP funding under 
section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) in the base 
period for which resources leveraged by the tribe are reported, and the 
tribe receives LIHEAP services under section 2602(b) through a directly-
funded tribal organization in the award period, the tribal organization 
will receive leveraging incentive funds on behalf of the tribe for the 
resources if the tribal organization submits a leveraging report meeting 
all applicable requirements.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Award period means the fiscal year during which 
leveraging incentive funds are distributed to grantees by the 
Department, based on the countable leveraging activities they reported 
to the Department for the preceding fiscal year (the base period).
    (2) Base period means the fiscal year for which a grantee's 
leveraging activities are reported to the Department; grantees' 
countable leveraging activities during the base period or base year are 
the basis for the distribution of leveraging incentive funds during the 
succeeding fiscal year (the award period or award year). Leveraged 
resources are counted in the base period during which their benefits are 
provided to low-income households.
    (3) Countable loan fund means revolving loan funds and similar loan 
instruments in which:
    (i) The sources of both the loaned and the repaid funds meet the 
requirements of this section, including the prohibitions of paragraphs 
(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3) of this section;
    (ii) Neither the loaned nor the repaid funds are Federal funds or 
payments from low-income households, and the loans are not made to low-
income households; and
    (iii) The benefits provided by the loaned funds meet the 
requirements of this section for countable leveraged resources and 
benefits.
    (4) Countable petroleum violation escrow funds means petroleum 
violation escrow (oil overcharge) funds that were distributed to a State 
or territory by the Department of Energy (DOE) after October 1, 1990, 
and interest earned in accordance with DOE policies on petroleum 
violation escrow funds that were distributed to a State or territory by 
DOE after October 1, 1990, that:
    (i) Were used to assist low-income households to meet the costs of 
home energy through (that is, within and as a part of) a State or 
territory's LIHEAP program, another Federal program, or a non-Federal 
program, in accordance with a submission for use of these petroleum 
violation escrow funds that was approved by DOE;
    (ii) Were not previously required to be allocated to low-income 
households; and
    (iii) Meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and 
of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) or (d)(2)(iii) or this section.
    (5) Home energy means a source of heating or cooling in residential 
dwellings.
    (6) Low-income households means federally eligible (federally 
qualified) households meeting the standards for LIHEAP income 
eligibility and/or LIHEAP categorical eligibility as set by section 
2605(b)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)(2)).
    (7) Weatherization means low-cost residential weatherization and 
other energy-related home repair for low-income households. 
Weatherization must be directly related to home energy.

[[Page 497]]

    (c) LIHEAP funds used to identify, develop, and demonstrate 
leveraging programs.
    (1) Each fiscal year, States (excluding Indian tribes, tribal 
organizations, and territories) may spend up to the greater of $35,000 
or 0.08 percent of their net Federal LIHEAP allotments (funds payable) 
allocated under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) 
specifically to identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs 
under section 2607A(c)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a(c)(2)). 
Each fiscal year, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and territories 
may spend up to the greater of two (2.0) percent or $100 of their 
Federal LIHEAP allotments allocated under section 2602(b) of Public law 
97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) specifically to identify, develop, and 
demonstrate leveraging programs under section 2607A(c)(2) of Public Law 
97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a(c)(2)). For the purpose of this paragraph, 
Federal LIHEAP allotments include funds from regular and supplemental 
appropriations, with the exception of leveraging incentive funds 
provided under section 2602(d) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(d)).
    (2) LIHEAP funds used under section 2607A(c)(2) of Public Law 97-35 
(42 U.S.C. 8626a(c)(2)) specifically to identify, develop, and 
demonstrate leveraging programs are not subject to the limitation in 
section 2605(b)(9) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)(9)) on the 
maximum percent of Federal funds that may be used for costs of planning 
and administration.
    (d) Basic requirements for leveraged resources and benefits. (1) In 
order to be counted under the leveraging incentive program, leveraged 
resources and benefits must meet all of the following five criteria:
    (i) They are from non-Federal sources.
    (ii) They are provided to the grantee's low-income home energy 
assistance program, or to federally qualified low-income households as 
described in section 2605(b)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 
8624(b)(2)).
    (iii) They are measurable and quantifiable in dollars.
    (iv) They represent a net addition to the total home energy 
resources available to low-income households in excess of the amount of 
such resources that could be acquired by these households through the 
purchase of home energy, or the purchase of items that help these 
households meet the cost of home energy, at commonly available household 
rates or costs, or that could be obtained with regular LIHEAP allotments 
provided under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)).
    (v) They meet the requirements for countable leveraged resources and 
benefits throughout this section and section 2607A of Public Law 97-35 
(42 U.S.C. 8626a).
    (2) Also, in order to be counted under the leveraging incentive 
program, leveraged resources and benefits must meet at least one of the 
following three criteria:
    (i) The grantee's LIHEAP program had an active, substantive role in 
developing and/or acquiring the resource/benefits from home energy 
vendor(s) through negotiation, regulation, and/or competitive bid. The 
actions or efforts of one or more staff of the grantee's LIHEAP program-
-at the central and/or local level--and/or one or more staff of LIHEAP 
program subrecipient(s) acting in that capacity, were substantial and 
significant in obtaining the resource/benefits from the vendor(s).
    (ii) The grantee appropriated or mandated the resource/benefits for 
distribution to low-income households through (that is, within and as a 
part of) its LIHEAP program. The resource/benefits are provided through 
the grantee's LIHEAP program to low-income households eligible under the 
grantee's LIHEAP standards, in accordance with the LIHEAP statute and 
regulations and consistent with the grantee's LIHEAP plan and program 
policies that were in effect during the base period, as if they were 
provided from the grantee's Federal LIHEAP allotment.
    (iii) The grantee appropriated or mandated the resource/benefits for 
distribution to low-income households as described in its LIHEAP plan 
(referred to in section 2605(c)(1)(A) of Public Law 97-35) (42 U.S.C. 
8624(c)(1)(A)). The resource/benefits are provided to low-income 
households as a supplement and/or alternative to the grantee's LIHEAP 
program, outside (that is, not through,

[[Page 498]]

within, or as a part of) the LIHEAP program. The resource/benefits are 
integrated and coordinated with the grantee's LIHEAP program. Before the 
end of the base period, the plan identifies and describes the resource/
benefits, their source(s), and their integration/coordination with the 
LIHEAP program. The Department will determine resources/benefits to be 
integrated and coordinated with the LIHEAP program if they meet at least 
one of the following eight conditions. If a resource meets at least one 
of conditions A through F when the grantee's LIHEAP program is operating 
(and meets all other applicable requirements), the resource also is 
countable when the LIHEAP program is not operating.
    (A) For all households served by the resource, the assistance 
provided by the resource depends on and is determined by the assistance 
provided to these households by the grantee's LIHEAP program in the base 
period. The resource supplements LIHEAP assistance that was not 
sufficient to meet households' home energy needs, and the type and 
amount of assistance provided by the resource is directly affected by 
the LIHEAP assistance received by the households.
    (B) Receipt of LIHEAP assistance in the base period is necessary to 
receive assistance from the resource. The resource serves only 
households that received LIHEAP assistance in the base period.
    (C) Ineligibility for the grantee's LIHEAP program, or denial of 
LIHEAP assistance in the base period because of unavailability of LIHEAP 
funds, is necessary to receive assistance from the resource.
    (D) For discounts and waivers: eligibility for and/or receipt of 
assistance under the grantee's LIHEAP program in the base period, and/or 
eligibility under the Federal standards set by section 2605(b)(2) of 
Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)(2)), is necessary to receive the 
discount or waiver.
    (E) During the period when the grantee's LIHEAP program is 
operating, staff of the grantee's LIHEAP program and/or staff assigned 
to the LIHEAP program by a local LIHEAP administering agency or 
agencies, and staff assigned to the resource communicate orally and/or 
in writing about how to meet the home energy needs of specific, 
individual households. For the duration of the LIHEAP program, this 
communication takes place before assistance is provided to each 
household to be served by the resource, unless the applicant for 
assistance from the resource presents documentation of LIHEAP 
eligibility and/or the amount of LIHEAP assistance received or to be 
received.
    (F) A written agreement between the grantee's LIHEAP program or 
local LIHEAP administering agency, and the agency administering the 
resource, specifies the following about the resource: eligibility 
criteria; benefit levels; period of operation; how the LIHEAP program 
and the resource are integrated/coordinated; and relationship between 
LIHEAP eligibility and/or benefit levels, and eligibility and/or benefit 
levels for the resource. The agreement provides for annual or more 
frequent reports to be provided to the LIHEAP program by the agency 
administering the resource.
    (G) The resource accepts referrals from the grantee's LIHEAP 
program, and as long as the resource has benefits available, it provides 
assistance to all households that are referred by the LIHEAP program and 
that meet the resource's eligibility requirements. Under this condition, 
only the benefits provided to households referred by the LIHEAP program 
are countable.
    (H) Before the grantee's LIHEAP heating, cooling, crisis, and/or 
weatherization assistance component(s) open and/or after the grantee's 
LIHEAP heating, cooling, crisis, and/or weatherization assistance 
component(s) close for the season or for the fiscal year, or before the 
entire LIHEAP program opens and/or after the entire LIHEAP program 
closes for the season or for the fiscal year, the resource is made 
available specifically to fill the gap caused by the absence of the 
LIHEAP component(s) or program. The resource is not available while the 
LIHEAP component(s) or program is operating.
    (e) Countable leveraged resources and benefits. Resources and 
benefits that are countable under the leveraging incentive program 
include but are not limited to the following, provided that

[[Page 499]]

they also meet all other applicable requirements:
    (1) Cash resources: State, tribal, territorial, and other public and

resources and benefits are not countable under the leveraging incentive 
program:
    (1) Resources (or portions of resources) obtained, arranged, 
provided, contributed, and/or paid for, by a low-income household for

section and of section 2607A of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a).
    (g) Valuation and documentation of leveraged resources and 
offsetting costs.
    (1) Leveraged cash resources will be valued at the fair market value 
of the benefits they provided to low-income households, as follows. 
Payments to or on behalf of low-income households for heating, cooling, 
and energy crisis assistance will be valued at their actual amount or 
value at the time they were provided. Purchased fuel, weatherization 
materials, and other countable tangible items will be valued at their 
fair market value (the commonly available household rate or cost in the 
local market area) at the time they were purchased. Installation, 
replacement, and repair of weatherization materials, and other countable 
services, will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid 
for similar work, by persons of similar skill in this work, in the 
grantee's or subrecipient's organization in the local area, at the time 
these services were provided. If the grantee or subrecipient does not 
have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent 
with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work, by 
persons of similar skill in this work, in the same labor market, at the 
time these services were provided. Fringe benefits and overhead costs 
will not be counted.
    (2) Home energy discounts, waivers, and credits will be valued at 
their actual amount or value.
    (3) Donated fuel, donated weatherization materials, and other 
countable donated tangible items will be valued at their fair market 
value (the commonly available household cost in the local market area) 
at the time of donation.
    (4) Donated unpaid services, and donated third-party paid services 
that are not in the employee's normal line of work, will be valued at 
rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work, by persons 
of similar skill in this work, in the grantee's or subrecipient's 
organization in the local area, at the time these services were 
provided. If the grantee or subrecipient does not have employees 
performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those 
ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work, by persons of 
similar skill in this work, in the same labor market, at the time these 
services were provided. Fringe benefits and overhead costs will not be 
counted. Donated third-party paid services of employees in their normal 
line of work will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay, 
excluding fringe benefits and overhead costs.
    (5) Offsetting costs and charges will be valued at their actual 
amount or value.
    (i) Funds from grantees' regular LIHEAP allotments that are used 
specifically to identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs 
under section 2607A(c)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a(c)(2)) 
will be deducted as offsetting costs in the base period in which these 
funds are obligated, whether or not there are any resulting leveraged 
benefits. Costs incurred from grantees' own funds to identify, develop, 
and demonstrate leveraging programs will be deducted in the first base 
period in which resulting leveraged benefits are provided to low-income 
households. If there is no resulting leveraged benefit from the 
expenditure of the grantee's own funds, the grantee's expenditure will 
not be counted or deducted.
    (ii) Any costs assessed or charged to low-income households on a 
continuing or on-going basis, year after year, specifically to 
participate in a counted leveraging program or to receive counted 
leveraged resources/benefits will be deducted in the base period these 
costs are paid. Any one-time costs or charges to low-income households 
specifically to participate in a counted leveraging program or to 
receive counted leveraged resources/benefits will be deducted in the 
first base period the leveraging program or resource is counted. Such 
costs or

[[Page 503]]

charges will be subtracted from the gross value of a counted resource or 
benefit for low-income households whose benefits are counted, but not 
for any households whose benefits are not counted.
    (6) Only the amount of the net addition to recipient low-income 
households' home energy resources may be counted in the valuation of a 
leveraged resource.
    (7) Leveraged resources and benefits, and offsetting costs and 
charges, will be valued according to the best data available to the 
grantee.
    (8) Grantees must maintain, or have readily available, records 
sufficient to document leveraged resources and benefits, and offsetting 
costs and charges, and their valuation. These records must be retained 
for three years after the end of the base period whose leveraged 
resources and benefits they document.
    (h) Leveraging report. (1) In order to qualify for leveraging 
incentive funds, each grantee desiring such funds must submit to the 
Department a report on the leveraged resources provided to low-income 
households during the preceeding base period. These reports must contain 
the following information in a format established by the Department.
    (i) For each separate leveraged resource, the report must:
    (A) Briefly describe the specific leveraged resource and the 
specific benefit(s) provided to low-income households by this resource, 
and state the source of the resource;
    (B) State whether the resource was acquired in cash, as a discount/
waiver, or as an in-kind contribution;
    (C) Indicate the geographical area in which the benefit(s) were 
provided to recipients;
    (D) State the month(s) and year(s) when the benefit(s) were provided 
to recipients;
    (E) State the gross dollar value of the countable benefits provided 
by the resource as determined in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section, indicate the source(s) of the data used, and describe how the 
grantee quantified the value and calculated the total amount;
    (F) State the number of low-income households to whom the benefit(s) 
were provided, and state the eligibility standard(s) for the low-income 
households to whom the benefit(s) were provided;
    (G) Indicate the agency or agencies that administered the resource/
benefit(s); and
    (H) Indicate the criterion or criteria for leveraged resources in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section that the resource/benefits meet, and 
for criteria in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, 
explain how resources/benefits valued at $5,000 or more meet the 
criterion or criteria.
    (ii) State the total gross dollar value of the countable leveraged 
resources and benefits provided to low-income households during the base 
period (the sum of the amounts listed pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(i)(E) 
of this section).
    (iii) State in dollars any costs incurred by the grantee to leverage 
resources, and any costs and charges imposed on low-income households to 
participate in a counted leveraging program or to receive counted 
leveraged benefits, as determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(5) of 
this section. Also state the amount of the grantee's regular LIHEAP 
allotment that the grantee used during the base period specifically to 
identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs under section 
2607A(c)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a(c)(2)).
    (iv) State the net dollar value of the countable leveraged resources 
and benefits for the base period. (Subtract the amounts in paragraph 
(h)(1)(iii) of this section from the amount in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of 
this section.)
    (2) Leveraging reports must be postmarked or hand-delivered not 
later than November 30 of the fiscal year for which leveraging incentive 
funds are requested.
    (3) The Department may require submission of additional 
documentation and/or clarification as it determines necessary to verify 
information in a grantee's leveraging report, to determine whether a 
leveraged resource is countable, and/or to determine the net valuation 
of a resource. In such cases, the Department will set a date by which it 
must receive information sufficient to document countability and/or

[[Page 504]]

valuation. In such cases, if the Department does not receive information 
that it considers sufficient to document countability and/or valuation 
by the date it has set, then the Department will not count the resource 
(or portion of resource) in question.
    (i) Determination of grantee shares of leveraging incentive funds. 
Allocation of leveraging incentive funds to grantees will be computed 
according to a formula using the following factors and weights:
    (1) Fifty (50) percent based on the final net value of countable 
leveraged resources provided to low-income households during the base 
period by a grantee relative to its net Federal allotment of funds 
allocated under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) 
during the base period, as a proportion of the final net value of the 
countable leveraged resources provided by all grantees during the base 
period relative to their net Federal allotment of funds allocated under 
that section during the base period; and
    (2) Fifty (50) percent based on the final net value of countable 
leveraged resources provided to low-income households during the base 
period by a grantee as a proportion of the total final net value of the 
countable leveraged resources provided by all grantees during the base 
period; except that: No grantee may receive more than twelve (12.0) 
percent of the total amount of leveraging incentive funds available for 
distribution to grantees in any award period; and no grantee may receive 
more than the smaller of its net Federal allotment of funds allocated 
under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) during the 
base period, or two times (double) the final net value of its countable 
leveraged resources for the base period. The calculations will be based 
on data contained in the leveraging reports submitted by grantees under 
paragraph (h) of this section as approved by the Department, and 
allocation data developed by the Department.
    (j) Uses of leveraging incentive funds.
    (1) Funds awarded to grantees under the leveraging incentive program 
must be used to increase or maintain heating, cooling, energy crisis, 
and/or weatherization benefits through (that is, within and as a part 
of) the grantee's LIHEAP program. These funds can be used for 
weatherization without regard to the weatherization maximum in section 
2605(k) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(k)). However, they cannot be 
counted in the base for calculation of the weatherization maximum for 
regular LIHEAP funds authorized under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-
35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)). Leveraging incentive funds cannot be used for 
costs of planning and administration. However, in either the award 
period or the fiscal year following the award period, they can be 
counted in the base for calculation of maximum grantee planning and 
administrative costs under section 2605(b)(9) of Public Law 97-35 (42 
U.S.C. 8624(b)(9)). They cannot be counted in the base for calculation 
of maximum carryover of regular LIHEAP funds authorized under section 
2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)).
    (2) Grantees must include the uses of leveraging incentive funds in 
their LIHEAP plans (referred to in section 2605(c)(1)(A) of Public Law 
97-35) (42 U.S.C. 8624(c)(1)(A)) for the fiscal year in which the 
grantee obligates these funds. Grantees must document uses of leveraging 
incentive funds in the same way they document uses of regular LIHEAP 
funds authorized under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 
8621(b)). Leveraging incentive funds are subject to the same audit 
requirements as regular LIHEAP funds.
    (k) Period of obligation for leveraging incentive funds. Leveraging 
incentive funds are available for obligation during both the award 
period and the fiscal year following the award period, without regard to 
limitations on carryover of funds in section 2607(b)(2)(B) of Public Law 
97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626(b)(2)(B)). Any leveraging incentive funds not 
obligated for allowable purposes by the end of this period must be 
returned to the Department.

Sec. 96.88  Administrative costs.

    (a) Costs of planning and administration. Any expenditure for 
governmental functions normally associated with administration of a 
public assistance program must be included in determining

[[Page 505]]

administrative costs subject to the statutory limitation on 
administrative costs, regardless of whether the expenditure is incurred 
by the State, a subrecipient, a grantee, or a contractor of the State.
    (b) Administrative costs for territories and Indian tribes. For 
Indian tribes, tribal organizations and territories with allotments of 
$20,000 or less, the limitation on the cost of planning and 
administering the low-income home energy assistance program shall be 20 
percent of funds payable and not transferred for use under another block 
grant. For tribes, tribal organizations and territories with allotments 
over $20,000, the limitation on the cost of planning and administration 
shall be $4,000 plus 10% of the amount of funds payable (and not 
transferred for use under another block grant) that exceeds $20,000.

assistance.

    The performance standards in section 2604(c) of Pub. L. 97-35 (42 
U.S.C. 8623), as amended by section 502(a) of the Human Services 
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-425)--concerning provision of 
energy crisis assistance within specified time limits, acceptance of 
applications for energy crisis benefits at geographically accessible 
sites, and provision to physically infirm low-income persons of the 
means to apply for energy crisis benefits at their residences or to 
travel to application sites--shall not apply under the conditions 
described in this section.

Sec. 96.124  Certain allocations.

    (a) States are required to expend the Block Grant on various 
activities in

[[Page 513]]

certain proportions. Specifically, as to treatment and prevention, the 
State shall expend the grant as follows:
    (1) not less than 35 percent for prevention and treatment activities 
regarding alcohol; and
    (2) not less than 35 percent for prevention and treatment activities 
regarding other drugs.
    (b) The States are also to expend the Block Grant on primary 
prevention programs as follows:
    (1) Consistent with Sec. 96.125, the State shall expend not less 
than 20 percent for programs for individuals who do not require 
treatment for substance abuse, which programs--
    (i) educate and counsel the individuals on such abuse; and
    (ii) provide for activities to reduce the risk of such abuse by the 
individuals;
    (2) The State shall, in carrying out paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section--
    (i) give priority to programs for populations that are at risk of 
developing a pattern of such abuse; and
    (ii) ensure that programs receiving priority under paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section develop community-based strategies for 
prevention of such abuse, including strategies to discourage the use of 
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products by individuals to whom it is 
unlawful to sell or distribute such beverages or products.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a State is required to 
expend the Block Grant on women services as follows:
    (1) The State for fiscal year 1993 shall expend not less than five 
percent of the grant to increase (relative to fiscal year 1992) the 
availability of treatment services designed for pregnant women and women 
with dependent children (either by establishing new programs or 
expanding the capacity of existing programs). The base for fiscal year 
1993 shall be an amount equal to the fiscal year 1992 alcohol and drug 
services Block Grant expenditures and State expenditures for pregnant 
women and women with dependent children as described in paragraph (e) of 
this section, and to this base shall be added at least 5 percent of the 
1993 Block Grant allotment. The base shall be calculated using Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles and the composition of the base shall be 
applied consistently from year to year. States shall report the methods 
used to calculate their base for fiscal year 1992 expenditures on 
treatment for pregnant women and women with dependent children.
    (2) For fiscal year 1994, the State shall, consistent with paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, expend not less than five percent of the grant 
to increase (relative to fiscal year 1993) the availability of such 
services to pregnant women and women with dependent children.
    (3) For grants beyond fiscal year 1994, the States shall expend no 
less than an amount equal to the amount expended by the State for fiscal 
year 1994.
    (d) Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may waive all or part 
of the requirement in paragraph (c) of this section if the Secretary 
determines that the State is providing an adequate level of services for 
this population. In determining whether an adequate level of services is 
being provided the Secretary will review the extent to which such 
individuals are receiving services. This determination may be supported 
by a combination of criminal justice data, the National Drug and 
Treatment Units Survey, statewide needs assessment data, waiting list 
data, welfare department data, including medicaid expenditures, or other 
State statistical data that are systematically collected. The Secretary 
will also consider the extent to which the State offers the minimum 
services required under Sec. 96.124(e). The Secretary shall approve or 
deny a request for a waiver not later than 120 days after the date on 
which the request is made. Any waiver provided by the Secretary shall be 
applicable only to the fiscal year involved.
    (e) With respect to paragraph (c) of this section, the amount set 
aside for such services shall be expended on individuals who have no 
other financial means of obtaining such services as provided in Sec. 
96.137. All programs providing such services will treat the family as a 
unit and therefore will admit both women and their children into 
treatment services, if appropriate. The State shall ensure that, at a 
minimum, treatment programs receiving funding

[[Page 514]]

for such services also provide or arrange for the provision of the 
following services to pregnant women and women with dependent children, 
including women who are attempting to regain custody of their children:
    (1) primary medical care for women, including referral for prenatal 
care and, while the women are receiving such services, child care;
    (2) primary pediatric care, including immunization, for their 
children;
    (3) gender specific substance abuse treatment and other therapeutic 
interventions for women which may address issues of relationships, 
sexual and physical abuse and parenting, and child care while the women 
are receiving these services;
    (4) therapeutic interventions for children in custody of women in 
treatment which may, among other things, address their developmental 
needs, their issues of sexual and physical abuse, and neglect; and
    (5) sufficient case management and transportation to ensure that 
women and their children have access to services provided by paragraphs 
(e) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (f) Procedures for the implementation of paragraphs (c) and (e) of 
this section will be developed in consultation with the State Medical 
Director for Substance Abuse Services.


<R05>
Sec. 96.125  Primary prevention.

    (a) For purposes of Sec. 96.124, each State/Territory shall develop 
and implement a comprehensive prevention program which includes a broad 
array of prevention strategies directed at individuals not identified to 
be in need of treatment. The comprehensive program shall be provided 
either directly or through one or more public or nonprofit private 
entities. The comprehensive primary prevention program shall include 
activities and services provided in a variety of settings for both the 
general population, as well as targeting sub-groups who are at high risk 
for substance abuse.
    (b) In implementing the prevention program the State shall use a 
variety of strategies, as appropriate for each target group, including 
but not limited to the following:
    (1) Information Dissemination: This strategy provides awareness and 
knowledge of the nature and extent of alcohol, tobacco and drug use, 
abuse and addiction and their effects on individuals, families and 
communities. It also provides knowledge and awareness of available 
prevention programs and services. Information dissemination is 
characterized by one-way communication from the source to the audience, 
with limited contact between the two. Examples of activities conducted 
and methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the 
following:
    (i) Clearinghouse/information resource center(s);
    (ii) Resource directories;
    (iii) Media campaigns;
    (iv) Brochures;
    (v) Radio/TV public service announcements;
    (vi) Speaking engagements;
    (vii) Health fairs/health promotion; and
    (viii) Information lines.
    (2) Education: This strategy involves two-way communication and is 
distinguished from the Information Dissemination strategy by the fact 
that interaction between the educator/facilitator and the participants 
is the basis of its activities. Activities under this strategy aim to 
affect critical life and social skills, including decision-making, 
refusal skills, critical analysis (e.g. of media messages) and 
systematic judgment abilities. Examples of activities conducted and 
methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the 
following:
    (i) Classroom and/or small group sessions (all ages);
    (ii) Parenting and family management classes;
    (iii) Peer leader/helper programs;
    (iv) Education programs for youth groups; and
    (v) Children of substance abusers groups.
    (3) Alternatives: This strategy provides for the participation of 
target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco and other 
drug use. The assumption is that constructive and healthy activities 
offset the attraction to, or otherwise meet the needs usually filled by 
alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and would, therefore,

[[Page 515]]

minimize or obviate resort to the latter. Examples of activities 
conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not 
limited to) the following:
    (i) Drug free dances and parties;
    (ii) Youth/adult leadership activities;
    (iii) Community drop-in centers; and
    (iv) Community service activities.
    (4) Problem Identification and Referral: This strategy aims at 
identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age-inappropriate 
use of tobacco or alcohol and those individuals who have indulged in the 
first use of illicit drugs in order to assess if their behavior can be 
reversed through education. It should be noted, however, that this 
strategy does not include any activity designed to determine if a person 
is in need of treatment. Examples of activities conducted and methods 
used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the following:
    (i) Employee assistance programs;
    (ii) Student assistance programs; and
    (iii) Driving while under the influence/driving while intoxicated 
education programs.
    (5) Community-Based Process: This strategy aims to enhance the 
ability of the community to more effectively provide prevention and 
treatment services for alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse disorders. 
Activities in this strategy include organizing, planning, enhancing 
efficiency and effectiveness of services implementation, inter-agency 
collaboration, coalition building and networking. Examples of activities 
conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not 
limited to) the following:
    (i) Community and volunteer training, e.g., neighborhood action 
training, training of key people in the system, staff/officials 
training;
    (ii) Systematic planning;
    (iii) Multi-agency coordination and collaboration;
    (iv) Accessing services and funding; and
    (v) Community team-building.
    (6) Environmental: This strategy establishes or changes written and 
unwritten community standards, codes and attitudes, thereby influencing 
incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other 
drugs used in the general population. This strategy is divided into two 
subcategories to permit distinction between activities which center on 
legal and regulatory initiatives and those which relate to the service 
and action-oriented initiatives. Examples of activities conducted and 
methods used for this strategy shall include (but not be limited to) the 
following:
    (i) Promoting the establishment and review of alcohol, tobacco and 
drug use policies in schools;
    (ii) Technical assistance to communities to maximize local 
enforcement procedures governing availability and distribution of 
alcohol, tobacco and other drug use;
    (iii) Modifying alcohol and tobacco advertising practices; and
    (iv) Product pricing strategies.

Sec. 96.126  Capacity of treatment for intravenous substance abusers.

    (a) In order to obtain Block Grant funds, the State must require 
programs that receive funding under the grant and that treat individuals 
for intravenous substance abuse to provide to the State, upon reaching 
90 percent of its capacity to admit individuals to the program, a 
notification of that fact within seven days. In carrying out this 
section, the State shall establish a capacity management program which 
reasonably implements this section--that is, which enables any such 
program to readily report to the State when it reaches 90 percent of its 
capacity--and which ensures the maintenance of a continually updated 
record of all such reports and which makes excess capacity information 
available to such programs.
    (b) In order to obtain Block Grant funds, the State shall ensure 
that each individual who requests and is in need of treatment for 
intravenous drug abuse is admitted to a program of such treatment not 
later than--
    (1) 14 days after making the request for admission to such a 
program; or
    (2) 120 days after the date of such request, if no such program has 
the capacity to admit the individual on the date of such request and if 
interim services, including referral for prenatal

[[Page 516]]

care, are made available to the individual not later than 48 hours after 
such request.
    (c) In carrying out subsection (b), the State shall establish a 
waiting list management program which provides systematic reporting of 
treatment demand. The State shall require that any program receiving 
funding from the grant, for the purposes of treating injecting drug 
abusers, establish a waiting list that includes a unique patient 
identifier for each injecting drug abuser seeking treatment including 
those receiving interim services, while awaiting admission to such 
treatment. For individuals who cannot be placed in comprehensive 
treatment within 14 days, the State shall ensure that the program 
provide such individuals interim services as defined in Sec. 96.121 and 
ensure that the programs develop a mechanism for maintaining contact 
with the individuals awaiting admission. The States shall also ensure 
that the programs consult the capacity management system as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section so that patients on waiting lists are 
admitted at the earliest possible time to a program providing such 
treatment within reasonable geographic area.
    (d) In carrying out paragraph (b)(2) of this section the State shall 
ensure that all individuals who request treatment and who can not be 
placed in comprehensive treatment within 14 days, are enrolled in 
interim services and those who remain active on a waiting list in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, are admitted to a 
treatment program within 120 days. If a person cannot be located for 
admission into treatment or, if a person refuses treatment, such persons 
may be taken off the waiting list and need not be provided treatment 
within 120 days. For example, if such persons request treatment later, 
and space is not available, they are to be provided interim services, 
placed on a waiting list and admitted to a treatment program within 120 
days from the latter request.
    (e) The State shall require that any entity that receives funding 
for treatment services for intravenous drug abuse carry out activities 
to encourage individuals in need of such treatment to undergo such 
treatment. The States shall require such entities to use outreach models 
that are scientifically sound, or if no such models are available which 
are applicable to the local situation, to use an approach which 
reasonably can be expected to be an effective outreach method. The model 
shall require that outreach efforts include the following:
    (1) Selecting, training and supervising outreach workers;
    (2) Contacting, communicating and following-up with high risk 
substance abusers, their associates, and neighborhood residents, within 
the constraints of Federal and State confidentiality requirements, 
including 42 C.F.R. Part 2;
    (3) Promoting awareness among injecting drug abusers about the 
relationship between injecting drug abuse and communicable diseases such 
as HIV;
    (4) Recommend steps that can be taken to ensure that HIV 
transmission does not occur; and
    (5) Encouraging entry into treatment.
    (f) The State shall develop effective strategies for monitoring 
programs compliance with this section. States shall report under the 
requirements of Sec. 96.122(g) on the specific strategies to be used to 
identify compliance problems and corrective actions to be taken to 
address those problems.


<R05>
Sec. 96.127  Requirements regarding tuberculosis.

    (a) States shall require any entity receiving amounts from the grant 
for operating a program of treatment for substance abuse to follow 
procedures developed by the principal agency of a State for substance 
abuse, in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance 
Abuse Services, and in cooperation with the State Department of Health/
Tuberculosis Control Officer, which address how the program--
    (1) Will, directly or through arrangements with other public or 
nonprofit private entities, routinely make available tuberculosis 
services as defined in Sec. 96.121 to each individual receiving 
treatment for such abuse;
    (2) In the case of an individual in need of such treatment who is 
denied admission to the program on the basis

[[Page 517]]

of the lack of the capacity of the program to admit the individual, will 
refer the individual to another provider of tuberculosis services; and
    (3) Will implement infection control procedures established by the 
principal agency of a State for substance abuse, in cooperation with the 
State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, which are 
designed to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis, including the 
following:
    (i) Screening of patients;
    (ii) Identification of those individuals who are at high risk of 
becoming infected; and
    (iii) Meeting all State reporting requirements while adhering to 
Federal and State confidentiality requirements, including 42 CFR part 2; 
and
    (4) will conduct case management activities to ensure that 
individuals receive such services.
    (b) The State shall develop effective strategies for monitoring 
programs compliance with this section. States shall report under the 
requirements of Sec. 96.122(g) on the specific strategies to be used to 
identify compliance problems and corrective actions to be taken to 
address those problems. The principal agency, in cooperation with the 
State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, shall also 
establish linkages with other health care providers to ensure that 
tuberculosis services are routinely made available. All individuals 
identified with active tuberculosis shall be reported to the appropriate 
State official as required by law and consistent with paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (c) With respect to services provided for by a State for purposes of 
compliance with this section, the State shall maintain Statewide 
expenditures of non-Federal amounts for such services at a level that is 
not less than an average level of such expenditures maintained by the 
State for the 2-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which 
the State receives such a grant. In making this determination, States 
shall establish a reasonable funding base for fiscal year 1993. The base 
shall be calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and 
the composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 96.128  Requirements regarding human immunodeficiency virus.

    (a) In the case of a designated State as described in paragraph (b) 
of this section, the State shall do the following--
    (1) with respect to individuals undergoing treatment for substance 
abuse, the State shall, subject to paragraph (c) of this section, carry 
out one or more projects to make available to the individuals early 
intervention services for HIV disease as defined in Sec. 96.121 at the 
sites at which the individuals are undergoing such treatment;
    (2) for the purpose of providing such early intervention services 
through such projects, the State shall make available from the grant the 
amounts prescribed by section 1924 of the PHS Act;
    (3) the State shall, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, carry 
out such projects only in geographic areas of the State that have the 
greatest need for the projects;
    (4) the State shall require programs participating in the project to 
establish linkages with a comprehensive community resource network of 
related health and social services organizations to ensure a wide-based 
knowledge of the availability of these services; and
    (5) the State shall require any entity receiving amounts from the 
Block Grant for operating a substance abuse treatment program to follow 
procedures developed by the principal agency of a State for substance 
abuse, in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance 
Abuse Services, and in cooperation with the State Department of Health/
Communicable Disease Officer.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a ``designated State'' is any 
State whose rate of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 10 
or more such cases per 100,000 individuals (as indicated by the number 
of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers 
for Disease Control for the most recent calendar year for which the data 
are available).
    (c) With respect to programs that provide treatment services for 
substance abuse, the State shall ensure that each such program 
participating

[[Page 518]]

in a project under paragraph (a) of this section will be a program that 
began operation prior to the fiscal year for which the State is applying 
to receive the grant. A program that so began operation may participate 
in a project under paragraph (a) of this section without regard to 
whether the program has been providing early intervention services for 
HIV disease.
    (d) If the State plans to carry out 2 or more projects under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the State shall carry out one such 
project in a rural area of the State, unless the requirement is waived. 
The Secretary shall waive the requirement if the State certifies to the 
Secretary that:
    (1) The rate of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is less 
than or equal to two such cases per 100,000 individuals in any rural 
area of the State, or there are so few infected persons that 
establishing a project in the area is not reasonable; or
    (2) There are no rural areas in the State as defined in Sec. 96.121.
    (e) With respect to the provision of early intervention services for 
HIV disease to an individual, the State shall ensure that the entities 
comply with Sec. 96.137 regarding payment and Sec. 96.135 regarding 
restrictions on expenditure of grant. The State shall also ensure that 
such services will be undertaken voluntarily by, and with the informed 
consent of, the individual, and undergoing such services will not be 
required as a condition of receiving treatment services for substance 
abuse or any other services.
    (f) With respect to services provided for a State for purposes of 
compliance with this section, the State shall maintain Statewide 
expenditures of non-Federal amounts for such services at a level that is 
not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the 
State for 2-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the 
State receives such a grant. In making this determination, States shall 
establish a reasonable base for fiscal year 1993. The base shall be 
calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the 
composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to year.


<R05>
Sec. 96.129  Revolving funds for establishment of homes in which recovering 
substance abusers may reside.

    (a) The State shall establish and provide for the ongoing operation 
of a revolving fund as follows:
    (1) The purpose of the fund is to make loans for the costs of 
establishing programs for the provision of housing in which individuals 
recovering from alcohol and drug abuse may reside in groups of not less 
than six individuals;
    (2) Not less than $100,000 will be available for the revolving fund;
    (3) Loans made from the revolving fund do not exceed $4,000 and that 
each such loan is repaid to the revolving fund not later than 2 years 
after the date on which the loan is made;
    (4) Each such loan is repaid by such residents through monthly 
installments by the date specified in the loan agreement involved;
    (5) Such loans are made only to nonprofit private entities agreeing 
that, in the operation of the program established pursuant to the loan--
    (i) The use of alcohol or any illegal drug in the housing provided 
by the program will be prohibited;
    (ii) Any resident of the housing who violates such prohibition will 
be expelled from the housing;
    (iii) The costs of the housing, including fees for rent and 
utilities, will be paid by the residents of the housing; and
    (iv) The residents of the housing will, through a majority vote of 
the residents, otherwise establish policies governing residence in the 
housing, including the manner in which applications for residence in the 
housing are approved;
    (6) States shall identify and clearly define legitimate purposes for 
which the funds will be spent, such as first month's rent, necessary 
furniture (e.g., beds), facility modifications (e.g., conversion of 
basement into a game room or extra bedrooms), and purchase of amenities 
which foster healthy group living (e.g., dishwasher);
    (7) In managing the revolving fund, the State and the financial 
entity managing the fund for the State shall abide by all Federal, State 
and local laws and regulations;

[[Page 519]]

    (8) If the State decides to indirectly manage the fund using a 
private nonprofit entity as the fund management group, the State shall 
establish reasonable criteria for selecting the group, such as 
qualifications, expertise, experience, and capabilities of the group, 
and the State shall require that these entities abide by all Federal, 
State and local laws and regulations;
    (9) The State may seek assistance to approve or deny applications 
from entities that meet State-established criteria;
    (10) The State shall set reasonable criteria in determining the 
eligibility of prospective borrowers such as qualifications, expertise, 
capabilities, the acceptability of a proposed plan to use the funds and 
operate the house, and an assessment of the potential borrower's ability 
to pay back the funds;
    (11) The State shall establish a procedure and process for applying 
for a loan under the program which may include completion of the 
application, personal interviews and submission of evidence to support 
eligibility requirements, as well as establish a written procedure for 
repayment which will set forth reasonable penalties for late or missed 
payments and liability and recourse for default;
    (12) The State shall provide clearly defined written instructions to 
applicants which lays out timeliness, milestones, required 
documentation, notification of reasonable penalties for late or missed 
payments and recourse for default, notification on legitimate purposes 
for which the loan may be spent, and other procedures required by the 
State; and
    (13) The State shall keep a written record of the number of loans 
and amount of loans provided, the identities of borrowers and the 
repayment history of each borrower and retain it for three years.
    (b) The requirements established in paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not apply to any territory of the United States other than the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


<R05>
Sec. 96.130  State law regarding sale of tobacco products to individuals 
under age of 18.

    (a) For purposes of this section, the term ``first applicable fiscal 
year'' means fiscal year 1994, except in the case of any State described 
in section 1926(a)(2) of the PHS Act, in which case ``first applicable 
fiscal year'' means fiscal year 1995. The term ``outlet'' is any 
location which sells at retail or otherwise distributes tobacco products 
to consumers including (but not limited to) locations that sell such 
products over-the-counter or through vending machines.
    (b) The Secretary may make a grant to a State only if the State, for 
the first applicable fiscal year and subsequent fiscal years, has in 
effect a law providing that it is unlawful for any manufacturer, 
retailer, or distributor of tobacco products to sell or distribute any 
such product to any individual under age 18 through any sales or 
distribution outlet, including over-the-counter and vending machine 
sales.
    (c) For the first and second applicable fiscal years, the State 
shall, at a minimum, conduct annually a reasonable number of random, 
unannounced inspections of outlets to ensure compliance with the law and 
plan and begin to implement any other actions which the State believes 
are necessary to enforce the law.
    (d) For the third and subsequent fiscal years, the States shall do 
the following:
    (1) The State shall conduct annual, random, unannounced inspections 
of both over-the-counter and vending machine outlets. The random 
inspections shall cover a range of outlets (not preselected on the basis 
of prior violations) to measure overall levels of compliance as well as 
to identify violations.
    (2) Random, unannounced inspections shall be conducted annually to 
ensure compliance with the law and shall be conducted in such a way as 
to provide a probability sample of outlets. The sample must reflect the 
distribution of the population under age 18 throughout the State and the 
distribution of the

outlets throughout the State accessible to youth.
    (e) As provided by Sec. 96.122(d), the State shall annually submit 
to the Secretary a report which shall include the following:
    (1) a detailed description of the State's activities to enforce the 
law required in paragraph (b) of this section during the fiscal year 
preceding the fiscal year for which that State is seeking the grant;
    (2) a detailed description regarding the overall success the State 
has achieved during the previous fiscal year in reducing the 
availability of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18, 
including the results of the unannounced inspections as provided by 
paragraph (d) of this section for which the results of over-the-counter 
and vending machine outlet inspections shall be reported separately;
    (3) a detailed description of how the unannounced inspections were 
conducted and the methods used to identify outlets;
    (4) the strategies to be utilized by the State for enforcing such 
law during the fiscal year for which the grant is sought; and
    (5) the identity of the agency or agencies designated by the 
Governor to be responsible for the implementation of the requirements of 
section 1926 of the PHS Act.
    (f) Beginning in the second applicable fiscal year, the annual 
report required under paragraph (e) of this section shall be made public 
within the State, along with the State plan as provided in section 1941 
of the PHS Act.
    (g) Beginning with applications for the fourth applicable fiscal 
year and all subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will negotiate with 
the State, as part of the State's plan, the interim performance target 
the State will meet for that fiscal year and in subsequent years will 
seek evidence of progress toward achieving or surpassing a performance 
objective in which the inspection failure rate would be no more than 20% 
within several years.
    (h) Beginning with the second applicable fiscal year and all 
subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall make a determination, 
before making a Block Grant to a State for that fiscal year, whether the 
State reasonably enforced its law in the previous fiscal year pursuant 
to this section. In making this determination, the Secretary will 
consider the following factors:
    (1) During the first and second applicable fiscal years, the State 
must conduct the activities prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) During the third applicable fiscal year, the State must conduct 
random, unannounced inspections in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (3) During the fourth and all subsequent applicable fiscal years, 
the State must do the following:
    (i) conduct random, unannounced inspections in accordance with 
paragraph (d); and
    (ii) except as provided by paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the 
State must be in substantial compliance with the target negotiated with 
the Secretary under paragraph (g) of this section for that fiscal year.
    (4) If a State has not substantially complied with the target as 
prescribed under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section for any fiscal 
year, the Secretary, in extraordinary circumstances, may consider a 
number of factors, including survey data showing that the State is 
making significant progress toward reducing use of tobacco products by 
children and youth, data showing that the State has progressively 
decreased the availability of tobacco products to minors, the 
composition of the outlets inspected as to whether they were over-the-
counter or vending machine outlets, and the State's plan for improving 
the enforcement of the law in the next fiscal year.
    (i) If, after notice to the State and an opportunity for a hearing, 
the Secretary determines under paragraph (h) of this section that the 
State has not maintained compliance, the Secretary will reduce the 
amount of the allotment in such amounts as is required by section 
1926(c) of the PHS Act.
    (j) States may not use the Block Grant to fund the enforcement of 
their statute, except that they may expend funds from the primary 
prevention setaside of their Block Grant allotment under 45 CFR 
96.124(b)(1) for carrying out the administrative aspects of the 
requirements such as the development

Sec. 96.131  Treatment services for pregnant women.

    (a) The State is required to, in accordance with this section, 
ensure that each pregnant woman in the State who seeks or is referred 
for and would benefit from such services is given preference in 
admissions to treatment facilities receiving funds pursuant to the 
grant. In carrying out this section, the State shall require all 
entities that serve women and who receive such funds to provide 
preference to pregnant women. Programs which serve an injecting drug 
abuse population and who receive Block Grant funds shall give preference 
to treatment as follows:
    (1) Pregnant injecting drug users;
    (2) Pregnant substance abusers;
    (3) Injecting drug users; and
    (4) All others.
    (b) The State will, in carrying out this provision publicize the 
availability to such women of services from the facilities and the fact 
that pregnant women receive such preference. This may be done by means 
of street outreach programs, ongoing public service announcements 
(radio/television), regular advertisements in local/regional print 
media, posters placed in targeted areas, and frequent notification of 
availability of such treatment distributed to the network of community 
based organizations, health care providers, and social service agencies.
    (c) The State shall in carrying out paragraph (a) of this section 
require that, in the event that a treatment facility has insufficient 
capacity to provide treatment services to any such pregnant woman who 
seeks the services from the facility, the facility refer the woman to 
the State. This may be accomplished by establishing a capacity 
management program, utilizing a toll-free number, an automated reporting 
system and/or other mechanisms to ensure that pregnant women in need of 
such services are referred as appropriate. The State shall maintain a 
continually updated system to identify treatment capacity for any such 
pregnant women and will establish a mechanism for matching the women in 
need of such services with a treatment facility that has the capacity to 
treat the woman.
    (d) The State, in the case of each pregnant woman for whom a 
referral under paragraph (a) of this section is made to the State--
    (1) will refer the woman to a treatment facility that has the 
capacity to provide treatment services to the woman; or
    (2) will, if no treatment facility has the capacity to admit the 
woman, make available interim services, including a referral for 
prenatal care, available to the woman not later than 48 hours after the 
woman seeks the treatment services.
    (e) Procedures for the implementation of this section shall be 
developed in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance 
Abuse Services.
    (f) The State shall develop effective strategies for monitoring 
programs compliance with this section. States shall report under the 
requirements of Sec. 96.122(g) on the specific strategies to be used to 
identify compliance problems and corrective actions to be taken to 
address those problems.


<R05>
Sec. 96.132  Additional agreements.

    (a) With respect to individuals seeking treatment services, the 
State is required to improve (relative to fiscal year 1992) the process 
in the State for referring the individuals to treatment facilities that 
can provide to the individuals the treatment modality that is most 
appropriate for the individuals. Examples of how this may be 
accomplished include the development and implementation of a capacity 
management/waiting list management system; the utilization of a toll-
free number for programs to report available capacity and waiting list 
data; and the utilization of standardized assessment procedures that 
facilitate the referral process.
    (b) With respect to any facility for treatment services or 
prevention activities that is receiving amounts from a Block Grant, 
continuing education in such services or activities (or both, as the 
case may be) shall be made available to employees of the facility who 
provide the services or activities. The

[[Page 522]]

States will ensure that such programs include a provision for continuing 
education for employees of the facility in its funding agreement.
    (c) The State shall coordinate prevention and treatment activities 
with the provision of other appropriate services (including health, 
social, correctional and criminal justice, educational, vocational 
rehabilitation, and employment services). In evaluating compliance with 
this section, the Secretary will consider such factors as the existence 
of memoranda of understanding between various service providers/agencies 
and evidence that the State has included prevention and treatment 
services coordination in its grants and contracts.
    (d) Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may provide to a 
State a waiver of any or all of the requirements established in 
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, if the Secretary determines 
that, with respect to services for the prevention and treatment of 
substance abuse, the requirement involved is unnecessary for maintaining 
quality in the provision of such services in the State. In evaluating 
whether to grant or deny a waiver, the Secretary will rely on 
information drawn from the independent peer review/quality assurance 
activities conducted by the State. For example, a State may be eligible 
for a waiver of the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section if a 
State already has a well developed process for referring individuals to 
treatment facilities that can provide to the individuals the treatment 
modality that is most appropriate for the individuals. The Secretary 
will approve or deny a request for a waiver not later than 120 days 
after the date on which the request is made. Any waiver provided by the 
Secretary for paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, will be 
applicable only to the fiscal year involved.
    (e) The State is also required to have in effect a system to protect 
from inappropriate disclosure patient records maintained by the State in 
connection with an activity funded under the program involved or by any 
entity which is receiving amounts from the grant and such system shall 
be in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws and 
regulations, including 42 CFR part 2. This system shall include 
provisions for employee education on the confidentiality requirements 
and the fact that disciplinary action may occur upon inappropriate 
disclosures. This requirement cannot be waived.


<R05>
Sec. 96.133  Submission to Secretary of Statewide assessment of needs.

    (a) The State is required to submit to the Secretary an assessment 
of the need in the State for authorized activities, both by locality and 
by the State in general. The State is to provide a broad range of 
information which includes the following:
    (1) The State is to submit data which shows the incidence and 
prevalence in the State of drug abuse and the incidence and prevalence 
in the State of alcohol abuse and alcoholism. For fiscal years 1993 
through 1996, the State shall submit its best available data on the 
incidence and prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse and alcoholism. The 
State shall also provide a summary describing the weakness and bias in 
the data and a description on how the State plans to strengthen the data 
in the future.
    (2) The State shall provide a description on current substance abuse 
prevention and treatment activities:
    (i) For fiscal year 1993, the State shall provide its best available 
data on current prevention and treatment activities in the State in such 
detail as it finds reasonably practicable given its own data collection 
activities and records.
    (ii) For fiscal year 1994 and subsequent years, the State shall 
provide a detailed description on current prevention and treatment 
activities in the State. This report shall include a detailed 
description of the intended use of the funds relating to prevention and 
treatment, as well as a description of treatment capacity. As to primary 
prevention activities, the activities must be broken down by strategies 
used, such as those provided in section 96.125, including the specific 
activities conducted. The State shall provide the following data if 
available: the specific risk factors being addressed by activity; the 
age, race/ethnicity and gender of the population being targeted by the

[[Page 523]]

prevention activity; and the community size and type where the activity 
is carried out. As to all treatment and prevention activities, including 
primary prevention, the State shall provide the identities of the 
entities that provide the services and describe the services provided. 
The State shall submit information on treatment utilization to describe 
the type of care and the utilization according to primary diagnosis of 
alcohol or drug abuse, or a dual diagnosis of drug and alcohol abuse.
    (3) The State may describe the need for technical assistance to 
carry out Block Grant activities, including activities relating to the 
collection of incidence and prevalence data identified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.
    (4) The State shall establish goals and objectives for improving 
substance abuse treatment and prevention activities and shall report 
activities taken in support of these goals and objectives in its 
application.
    (5) The State shall submit a detailed description on the extent to 
which the availability of prevention and treatment activities is 
insufficient to meet the need for the activities, the interim services 
to be made available under sections 96.126 and 96.131, and the manner in 
which such services are to be so available. Special attention should be 
provided to the following groups:
    (i) Pregnant addicts;
    (ii) Women who are addicted and who have dependent children;
    (iii) Injecting drug addicts; and
    (iv) Substance abusers infected with HIV or who have tuberculosis.
    (6) Documentation describing the results of the State's management 
information system pertaining to capacity and waiting lists shall also 
be submitted, as well as a summary of such information for admissions 
and, when available, discharges. As to prevention activities, the report 
shall include a description of the populations at risk of becoming 
substance abusers.


<R05>
Sec. 96.134  Maintenance of effort regarding State expenditures.

    (a) With respect to the principal agency of a State for carrying out 
authorized activities, the agency shall for each fiscal year maintain 
aggregate State expenditures by the principal agency for authorized 
activities at a level that is not less than the average level of such 
expenditures maintained by the State for the two year period preceding 
the fiscal year for which the State is applying for the grant. The Block 
Grant shall not be used to supplant State funding of alcohol and other 
drug prevention and treatment programs.
    (b) Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may waive all or part 
of the requirement established in paragraph (a) of this section if the 
Secretary determines that extraordinary economic conditions in the State 
justify the waiver. The State involved must submit information 
sufficient for the Secretary to make the determination, including the 
nature of the extraordinary economic circumstances, documented evidence 
and appropriate data to support the claim, and documentation on the year 
for which the State seeks the waiver. The Secretary will approve or deny 
a request for a waiver not later than 120 days after the date on which 
the request is made. Any waiver provided by the Secretary shall be 
applicable only to the fiscal year involved. ``Extraordinary economic 
conditions'' mean a financial crisis in which the total tax revenue 
declines at least one and one-half percent, and either unemployment 
increases by at least one percentage point, or employment declines by at 
least one and one-half percent.
    (c) In making a Block Grant to a State for a fiscal year, the 
Secretary shall make a determination of whether, for the previous fiscal 
year or years, the State maintained material compliance with any 
agreement made under paragraph (a) of this section. If the Secretary 
determines that a State has failed to maintain such compliance, the 
Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment for the State for the 
fiscal year for which the grant is being made by an amount equal to the 
amount constituting such failure for the previous fiscal year.
    (d) The Secretary may make a Block Grant for a fiscal year only if 
the State involved submits to the Secretary information sufficient for 
the Secretary to make the determination required in

[[Page 524]]

paragraph (a) of this section, which includes the dollar amount 
reflecting the aggregate State expenditures by the principal agency for 
authorized activities for the two State fiscal years preceding the 
fiscal year for which the State is applying for the grant. The base 
shall be calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and 
the composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 96.135  Restrictions on expenditure of grant.

    (a) The State shall not expend the Block Grant on the following 
activities:
    (1) To provide inpatient hospital services, except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) To make cash payments to intended recipients of health services;
    (3) To purchase or improve land, purchase, construct, or permanently 
improve (other than minor remodeling) any building or other facility, or 
purchase major medical equipment;
    (4) To satisfy any requirement for the expenditure of non-Federal 
funds as a condition for the receipt of Federal funds;
    (5) To provide financial assistance to any entity other than a 
public or nonprofit private entity; or
    (6) To provide individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes so 
that such individuals may use illegal drugs, unless the Surgeon General 
of the Public Health Service determines that a demonstration needle 
exchange program would be effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk 
that the public will become infected with the etiologic agent for AIDS.
    (b) The State shall limit expenditures on the following:
    (1) The State involved will not expend more than 5 percent of the 
grant to pay the costs of administering the grant; and
    (2) The State will not, in expending the grant for the purpose of 
providing treatment services in penal or correctional institutions of 
the State, expend more than an amount prescribed by section 1931(a)(3) 
of the PHS Act.
    (c) Exception regarding inpatient hospital services.
    (1) With respect to compliance with the agreement made under 
paragraph (a) of this section, a State (acting through the Director of 
the principal agency) may expend a grant for inpatient hospital-based 
substance abuse programs subject to the limitations of paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section only when it has been determined by a physician that:
    (i) The primary diagnosis of the individual is substance abuse, and 
the physician certifies this fact;
    (ii) The individual cannot be safely treated in a community-based, 
nonhospital, residential treatment program;
    (iii) The Service can reasonably be expected to improve an 
individual's condition or level of functioning;
    (iv) The hospital-based substance abuse program follows national 
standards of substance abuse professional practice; and
    (2) In the case of an individual for whom a grant is expended to 
provide inpatient hospital services described above, the allowable 
expenditure shall conform to the following:
    (i) The daily rate of payment provided to the hospital for providing 
the services to the individual will not exceed the comparable daily rate 
provided for community-based, nonhospital, residential programs of 
treatment for substance abuse; and
    (ii) The grant may be expended for such services only to the extent 
that it is medically necessary, i.e., only for those days that the 
patient cannot be safely treated in a residential, community-based 
program.
    (d) The Secretary may approve a waiver for construction under 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section within 120 days after the date of a 
request only if:
    (1) The State demonstrates to the Secretary that adequate treatment 
cannot be provided through the use of existing facilities and that 
alternative facilities in existing suitable buildings are not available;
    (2) The State has carefully designed a plan that minimizes the costs 
of renovation or construction;
    (3) The State agrees, with respect to the costs to be incurred by 
the State in carrying out the purpose of the waiver, to make available 
non-Federal contributions in cash toward such costs in

provided under the Block Grant; and
    (4) The State submits the following to support paragraphs (b)(1), 
(2) and (3), of this section:
    (i) Documentation to support paragraph (d)(1) of this section, such 
as local needs assessments, waiting lists, survey data and other related 
information;
    (ii) A brief description of the project to be funded, including the

project;
    (iv) The number of outpatient treatment slots planned or the number 
of residential beds planned, if applicable;

rehabilitation (and a description of how these estimates were 
determined), based on an independent estimate of said cost, using 
standardized measures as determined by an appropriate State construction 
certifying authority;
    (vi) An assurance by the State that all applicable National (e.g., 
National Fire Protection Association, Building Officials and Codes 
Administrators International), Federal (National Environmental Policy 
Act), State, and local standards for construction or rehabilitation of 
health care facilities will be complied with;
    (vii) Documentation of the State's commitment to obligate these 
funds by the end of the first year in which the funds are available, and 
that such funds must be expended by the end of the second year (section 
1914(a)(2) of the PHS Act);
    (viii) A certification that there is public support for a waiver, as 
well as a description of the procedure used (and the results therein) to 
ensure adequate comment from the general public and the appropriate 
State and local health planning organizations, local governmental 
entities and public and private-sector service providers that may be 
impacted by the waiver request;
    (ix) Evidence that a State is committed to using the proposed new or

for rehabilitated facilities;
    (x) An assurance that, if the facility ceases to be used for such 
services, or if the facility is sold or transferred for a purpose 
inconsistent with the State's waiver request, monies will be returned to 
the Federal Government in an amount proportionate to the Federal 
assistance provided, as it relates to the value of the facility at the 
time services cease or the facility sold or transferred;
    (xi) A description of the methods used to minimize the costs of the 
construction or rehabilitation, including documentation of the costs of 
the residential facilities in the local area or other appropriate 
equivalent sites in the State;
    (xii) An assurance that the State shall comply with the matching 
requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and
    (xiii) Any other information the Secretary may determine to be

<R05>
Sec. 96.136  Independent peer review.

    (a) The State shall for the fiscal year for which the grant is 
provided, provide for independent peer review to assess the quality, 
appropriateness, and efficacy of treatment services provided in the 
State to individuals under the program involved, and ensure that at 
least 5 percent of the entities providing services in the State under 
such program are reviewed. The programs reviewed shall be representative 
of the total population of such entities.
    (b) The purpose of independent peer review is to review the quality 
and appropriateness of treatment services. The review will focus on 
treatment programs and the substance abuse service system rather than on 
the individual practitioners. The intent of the independent peer review 
process is to continuously improve the treatment services to alcohol and 
drug abusers within the State system. ``Quality,'' for purposes of this 
section, is the provision of treatment services which, within the 
constraints of technology,

[[Page 526]]

resources, and patient/client circumstances, will meet accepted 
standards and practices which will improve patient/client health and 
safety status in the context of recovery. ``Appropriateness,'' for 
purposes of this section, means the provision of treatment services 
consistent with the individual's identified clinical needs and level of 
functioning.
    (c) The independent peer reviewers shall be individuals with 
expertise in the field of alcohol and drug abuse treatment. Because 
treatment services may be provided by multiple disciplines, States will 
make every effort to ensure that individual peer reviewers are 
representative of the various disciplines utilized by the program under 
review. Individual peer reviewers must also be knowledgeable about the 
modality being reviewed and its underlying theoretical approach to 
addictions treatment, and must be sensitive to the cultural and 
environmental issues that may influence the quality of the services 
provided.
    (d) As part of the independent peer review, the reviewers shall 
review a representative sample of patient/client records to determine 
quality and appropriateness of treatment services, while adhering to all 
Federal and State confidentiality requirements, including 42 CFR Part 2. 
The reviewers shall examine the following:
    (1) Admission criteria/intake process;
    (2) Assessments;
    (3) Treatment planning, including appropriate referral, e.g., 
prenatal care and tuberculosis and HIV services;
    (4) Documentation of implementation of treatment services;
    (5) Discharge and continuing care planning; and
    (6) Indications of treatment outcomes.
    (e) The State shall ensure that the independent peer review will not 
involve practitioners/providers reviewing their own programs, or 
programs in which they have administrative oversight, and that there be 
a separation of peer review personnel from funding decisionmakers. In 
addition, the State shall ensure that independent peer review is not 
conducted as part of the licensing/certification process.
    (f) The States shall develop procedures for the implementation of 
this section and such procedures shall be developed in consultation with 
the State Medical Director for Substance Abuse Services.


<R05>
Sec. 96.137  Payment schedule.

    (a) The Block Grant money that may be spent for Sec.Sec. 96.124(c) 
and (e), 96.127 and 96.128 is governed by this section which ensures 
that the grant will be the ``payment of last resort.'' The entities that 
receive funding under the Block Grant and provides services required by 
the above-referenced sections shall make every reasonable effort, 
including the establishment of systems for eligibility determination, 
billing, and collection, to:
    (1) Collect reimbursement for the costs of providing such services 
to persons who are entitled to insurance benefits under the Social 
Security Act, including programs under title XVIII and title XIX, any 
State compensation program, any other public assistance program for 
medical expenses, any grant program, any private health insurance, or 
any other benefit program; and
    (2) Secure from patients or clients payments for services in 
accordance with their ability to pay.

[58 FR 60128, Nov. 15, 1993]

       Appendix B to Part 96--SSBG Reporting Form and Instructions

                              Instructions

    This form must be used by states as the reporting instrument to 
satisfy the requirements of 45 CFR 96.74(a) (1) through (4). Following 
are instructions on how to complete the form:

                                 General

    1. Enter the name of the state submitting the form.
    2. Enter the fiscal year for which the form is being submitted. 
Either the state or federal fiscal year may be used.
    3. Enter the month and year of the beginning and end of the fiscal 
year--e.g., 07/91 to 06/92.

                                Services

    4. The ``service'' column contains a list of services that are to be 
used for national reporting. This list in no way mandates how a state is 
to design its program of services under the SSBG, but rather is to be 
used only to obtain nationally comparable statistics. If the services 
that your state provides reasonably fit the uniform service definitions 
in appendix A, use them. In cases where no fit is possible between the 
state services and the services on the form, use item number 29--the 
other services category. Please list all services reported under item

[[Page 531]]

29, using a separate sheet if necessary. The state's definition of these 
services must appear in the state's annual report.

                             Recipient Data

    In reporting the following data:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Each state should use its own definitions of the 
terms ``adult'' and ``child.'' These definitions should be described 
elsewhere in the annual report. If the definitions of adult and child 
vary by services, all such definitions must be included.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> States should, if possible, consider as the 
``recipient'' of the service the individual to whom the service is 
provided. This means that the child would be considered the recipient of 
child day care services, even if such services are provided to allow the 
child's adult caretaker to pursue employment. Similarly, an adult who 
receives counseling services should be considered as the recipient of 
that service, even if the service is provided as part of a child's 
protective services plan. In cases where each member of a family, for 
example, receives an individual service such as counseling, each family 
member should be considered as a separate recipient.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> States should, if possible, consider as a 
service, i.e., a count of one, any service provided to a single 
recipient for the duration of the reporting period (one year), or any 
fraction thereof. In cases where an individual received a service during 
the reporting period, then discontinued the service, and then received 
the service again, the individual should only be counted once, if 
possible.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The criteria applied in determining eligibility 
for each service--such as income eligibility guidelines, sliding fee 
scales, the effect of public assistance benefits, and any requirements 
for enrollment in school or training programs--should be described 
elsewhere in the annual report.
    5. Under ``Number of Recipients--Adults'' enter the number of adults 
who have received each service funded in whole or part under the SSBG.
    6. Under ``Number of Recipients--Children'' enter the number of 
children who have received each service funded in whole or part under 
the SSBG.
    7. Under ``Number of Recipients--Total'' enter the total number of 
recipients of each service. This should be the sum of the adults and 
children reported in the preceding ``adult'' and ``children'' columns.

                            Expenditure Data

    8. Under ``Expenditures--Total $'' enter all funds that the state 
expends on each service. This should include SSBG funds as well as funds 
from other federal sources, state funds, and local funds. A listing of 
the sources of these funds, and the amounts allocated, should appear 
elsewhere in the annual report.
    9. Under ``Expenditures--SSBG $'' enter the total SSBG funds 
expended for each service. This column should be totaled, and the sum 
placed at the bottom of the column in the ``Totals'' box.
    10. Under ``Expenditures--Per Adult'' enter the average amount of 
SSBG funds expended on each adult recipient of each service.
    11. Under ``Expenditures--Per Child'' enter the average amount of 
SSBG funds expended on each child recipient of each service.
    12. Item 30 in the ``Total SSBG $'' column should contain other 
expenditures and income as follows:
    a. ``Transfers In'' should contain funds transferred from other 
federal block grants to the SSBG program. A listing of the source(s) of 
block grant funds and their amounts should appear elsewhere in the 
annual report.
    b. ``Transfers Out'' should show funds transferred from the SSBG 
program to other federal block grants. A listing of the program(s) to 
which SSBG funds were transferred, and the amounts, should appear 
elsewhere in the annual report.
    c. ``Carry Forward'' should show funds the state intends to carry 
over from the reporting fiscal year to the following fiscal year. The 
SSBG statute permits states two years to expend SSBG funds.
    d. ``Carry Over'' should show funds carried from a previous fiscal 
year into the current reporting year.
    e. ``Administrative Costs'' should show all other non-service use of 
SSBG funds--e.g., funds expended for training, licensing activities, or 
overhead costs.
    f. This column should be totaled, and the sum placed at the bottom 
of the column in the ``Totals'' box.
    13. Under ``Provisions Method--Public/Private'' enter a check mark 
on ``X'' in the appropriate column(s) to indicate whether a service was 
provided by public agencies or private agencies. In some cases, a given 
service may have been provided by both methods, in which case both 
columns would be checked for that service.
    14. Enter the name, title, and telephone number of a contact person 
who can answer questions about the data.
    15. Code Column:
    Six of the columns on this form have a ``C'' column to the right of 
them. These are ``Code'' columns to permit a state to indicate, for 
expenditure data, whether each cell of data is A (actual), E 
(estimated), or S (sampled), and for recipient data, whether the data is 
based on an unduplicated (U) or duplicated (D) count of recipients. 
These codes will permit the Department to determine the relative degree 
of statistical validity of the data. Actual recipient counts and 
expenditure amounts must be used when available. If actual counts are 
not available, sampling and/or estimating may be used to

[[Page 532]]

derive the numbers in this report. A description of the sampling and/or 
estimation methods used to derive any data must appear elsewhere in the 
annual report.

                  Report Submission Using PC Diskettes

    States with personal computer (PC) equipment may submit this data 
using PC diskettes in addition to the hardcopy form which will be 
included in the complete annual report. Diskettes may be either 5\1/
4\Prime; or 3\1/2\Prime;; data may be submitted using Lotus 1-2-3, 
Quattro Pro, DBase III or IV, Wordstar, Word Perfect, or ASCII formats. 
Use of Lotus 1-2-3 is preferred, but any of the other formats listed may 
be used. If a state wishes to use a format other than one listed here, 
please call Bryant Tudor on (202) 401-5535 or Frank Burns on (202) 401-
5536, or write to the Office of Community Services, Administration for 
Children and Families, Fourth Floor--East Wing, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, 
SW., Washington, DC 10447. Use of diskettes can greatly reduce 
transcription errors and also facilitate processing of the data once 
received. We anticipate that many states will want to avail themselves 
of this method of reporting.

within the State;
    (2) Promote parental choice to empower working parents to make their 
own decisions on the child care that best suits their family's needs;
    (3) Encourage States to provide consumer education information to 
help parents make informed choices about child care;
    (4) Assist States to provide child care to parents trying to achieve 
independence from public assistance; and
    (5) Assist States in implementing the health, safety, licensing, and 
registration standards established in State regulations.
    (b) The purpose of the CCDF is to increase the availability, 
affordability, and quality of child care services. The program offers 
Federal funding to States, Territories, Indian Tribes, and tribal 
organizations in order to:
    (1) Provide low-income families with the financial resources to find 
and afford quality child care for their children;
    (2) Enhance the quality and increase the supply of child care for 
all families, including those who receive no direct assistance under the

    (3) Provide parents with a broad range of options in addressing 
their child care needs;
    (4) Strengthen the role of the family;
    (5) Improve the quality of, and coordination among, child care 
programs

[[Page 537]]

and early childhood development programs; and
    (6) Increase the availability of early childhood development and 
before- and after-school care services.
    (c) The purpose of these regulations is to provide the basis for 
administration of the Fund. These regulations provide that Lead 
Agencies:
    (1) Maximize parental choice through the use of certificates and 
through grants and contracts;
    (2) Include in their programs a broad range of child care providers, 
including center-based care, family child care, in-home care, care 
provided by relatives and sectarian child care providers;
    (3) Provide quality child care that meets applicable requirements;
    (4) Coordinate planning and delivery of services at all levels;
    (5) Design flexible programs that provide for the changing needs of 
recipient families;
    (6) Administer the CCDF responsibly to ensure that statutory 
requirements are met and that adequate information regarding the use of 
public funds is provided; and
    (7) Design programs that provide uninterrupted service to families

agencies or organizations, no funds shall be expended for the purchase 
or improvement of land, or for the purchase, construction, or permanent 
improvement of any building or facility. However, funds may be expended 
for minor remodeling, and for upgrading child care facilities to assure 
that providers meet State and local child care standards, including 
applicable health and safety requirements.
    (2) For sectarian agencies or organizations, the prohibitions in

to Sec.8.41.
    (3) Tribes and tribal organizations are subject to the requirements 
at Sec. 98.84 regarding construction and renovation.

    (i) A base amount as set by the Secretary; and
    (ii) An additional amount per Indian child under age 13 (or such 
similar age as determined by the Secretary from the best available

this section, that bears the same ratio as the number of Indian children 
in the Tribe living on or near the reservation, or other appropriate 
area served by the tribal grantee, pursuant to Sec. 98.80(e), does to 
50; and
    (ii) An additional amount per Indian child, pursuant to paragraph

allocated an amount equal to its share of the total available under 
section 418(a)(3) of the Social Security Act. That amount is based on 
the same ratio as the number of children under age 13 residing in the 
State bears to the national total of children under age 13. The number 
of children under 13 is derived from the best data available to the 
Secretary for the second preceding fiscal year.
    (b) For purposes of this subsection, the amounts available under

Sec. 98.64  Reallotment and redistribution of funds.

    (a) According to the provisions of this section State and Tribal 
Discretionary Funds are subject to reallotment, and State Matching Funds 
are subject to redistribution. State funds are reallotted or 
redistributed only to States as defined for the original allocation. 
Tribal funds are reallotted only to Tribes. Funds granted to the 
Territories are not subject to reallotment. Any funds granted to the 
Territories that are returned after they have been allotted will revert 
to the Federal government.
    (b) Any portion of a State's Discretionary Fund allotment that is 
not required to carry out its Plan, in the period for which the 
allotment is made available, shall be reallotted to other States in 
proportion to the original allotments. For purposes of this paragraph 
the term ``State'' means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The other Territories and the Tribes 
may not receive reallotted State Discretionary Funds.
    (1) Each year, the State shall report to the Secretary either the 
dollar amount from the previous year's grant that it will be unable to 
obligate by the end of the obligation period or that all funds will be 
obligated during such time. Such report shall be postmarked by April 
1st.
    (2) Based upon the reallotment reports submitted by States, the 
Secretary will reallot funds.
    (i) If the total amount available for reallotment is $25,000 or 
more, funds will be reallotted to States in proportion to each State's 
allotment for the applicable fiscal year's funds, pursuant to Sec. 
98.61(a).

[[Page 556]]

    (ii) If the amount available for reallotment is less than $25,000, 
the Secretary will not reallot any funds, and such funds will revert to 
the Federal government.
    (iii) If an individual reallotment amount to a State is less than 
$500, the Secretary will not issue the award, and such funds will revert 
to the Federal government.
    (3) If a State does not submit a reallotment report by the deadline 
for report submittal, either:
    (i) The Secretary will determine that the State does not have any 
funds available for reallotment; or
    (ii) In the case of a report postmarked after April 1st, any funds 
reported to be available for reallotment shall revert to the Federal 
government.
    (4) States receiving reallotted funds shall obligate and expend 
these funds in accordance with Sec. 98.60. The reallotment of funds does 
not extend the obligation period or the program period for expenditure 
of such funds.
    (c)(1) Any portion of the Matching Fund granted to a State that is 
not obligated in the period for which the grant is made shall be 
redistributed. Funds, if any, will be redistributed on the request of, 
and only to, those other States that have met the requirements of Sec. 
98.53(c) in the period for which the grant was first made. For purposes 
of this paragraph the term ``State'' means the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia. Territorial and tribal grantees may not receive 
redistributed Matching Funds.
    (2) Matching Funds allotted to a State under Sec. 98.63(a), but not 
granted, shall also be redistributed in the manner described in 
paragraph (1) of this section.
    (3) The amount of Matching Funds granted to a State that will be 
made available for redistribution will be based on the State's financial 
report to ACF for the Child Care and Development Fund (ACF-696) and is 
subject to the monetary limits at paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) A State eligible to receive redistributed Matching Funds shall 
also use the ACF-696 to request its share of the redistributed funds, if 
any.
    (5) A State's share of redistributed Matching Funds is based on the 
same ratio as the number of children under 13 residing in the State to 
the number of children residing in all States eligible to receive and 
that request the redistributed Matching Funds.
    (6) Redistributed funds are considered part of the grant for the 
fiscal year in which the redistribution occurs.
    (d) Any portion of a Tribe's allotment of Discretionary Funds that 
is not required to carry out its Plan, in the period for which the 
allotment is made available, shall be reallotted to other tribal 
grantees in proportion to their original allotments. States and 
Territories may not receive reallotted tribal funds.
    (1) Each year, the Tribe shall report to the Secretary either the 
dollar amount from the previous year's grant that it will be unable to 
obligate by the end of the obligation period or that all funds will be 
obligated during such time. Such report shall be postmarked by a 
deadline established by the Secretary.
    (2) Based upon the reallotment reports submitted by Tribes, the 
Secretary will reallot Tribal Discretionary Funds among the other 
Tribes.
    (i) If the total amount available for reallotment is $25,000 or 
more, funds will be reallotted to other tribal grantees in proportion to 
each Tribe's original allotment for the applicable fiscal year pursuant 
to Sec. 98.62(c).
    (ii) If the total amount available for reallotment is less than

construction or major renovation by the end of the second fiscal year 
following the fiscal year for which the grant is awarded.

Secretary will provide to the Lead Agency a written notice of a finding 
of non-compliance. This notice will be issued within 60 days of the

[[Page 564]]

the opportunity for a hearing, pursuant to part 99.

    (a) Upon a final determination that the Lead Agency has failed to 
substantially comply with the Act, the implementing regulations, or the 
Plan, one of the following penalties will be applied:
    (1) The Secretary will disallow the improperly expended funds;
    (2) An amount equal to or less than the improperly expended funds 
will be deducted from the administrative portion of the State allotment 
for the following fiscal year; or
    (3) A combination of the above options will be applied.
    (b) In addition to imposing the penalties described in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Secretary may impose other appropriate sanctions, 
including:
    (1) Disqualification of the Lead Agency from the receipt of further 
funding under the CCDF; or
    (2)(i) A penalty of not more than four percent of the funds allotted 
under Sec. 98.61 (i.e., the Discretionary Funds) for a Fiscal Year shall 
be withheld if the Secretary determines that the Lead Agency has failed 
to implement a provision of the Act, these regulations, or the Plan 
required under Sec. 98.16;
    (ii) This penalty will be withheld no earlier than the second full 
quarter following the quarter in which the Lead Agency was notified of 
the proposed penalty;
    (iii) This penalty will not be applied if the Lead Agency corrects 
the failure or violation before the penalty is to be applied or if it 
submits a plan for corrective action that is acceptable to the 
Secretary; or
    (iv) The Lead Agency may show cause to the Secretary why the amount 
of the penalty, if applied, should be reduced.
    (c) If a Lead Agency is subject to additional sanctions as provided

additional sanctions being imposed will be provided in the notice 
provided pursuant to Sec. 98.91.
    (d) Nothing in this section, or in Sec. 98.90 or Sec. 98.91, will 
preclude the Lead Agency and the Department from informally resolving a 
possible compliance issue without following all of the steps described 
in Sec.Sec. 98.90, 98.91 and 98.92. Penalties and/or sanctions, as 
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may nevertheless be 
applied, even though the issue is resolved informally.
    (e) It is at the Secretary's sole discretion to choose the penalty 
to be imposed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 98.93  Complaints.

    (a) This section applies to any complaint (other than a complaint 
alleging violation of the nondiscrimination provisions) that a Lead 
Agency has failed to use its allotment in accordance with the terms of 
the Act, the implementing regulations, or the Plan. The Secretary is not 
required to consider a complaint unless it is submitted as required by 
this section. Complaints with respect to discrimination should be 
referred to the Office of Civil Rights of the Department.

the affected Lead Agency. Any comments received from the Lead Agency 
within 60 days (or such longer period as may be agreed upon between the 
Lead Agency and Department) shall be considered by the Department in 
responding to the complaint. The Department will conduct an 
investigation of complaints, where appropriate.

[[Page 565]]

    (d) The Department will provide a written response to complaints 
within 180 days after receipt. If a final resolution cannot be provided 
at that time, the response will state the reasons why additional time is 
necessary.
    (e) Complaints that are not satisfactorily resolved through 
communication with the Lead Agency will be pursued through the process 
described in Sec. 98.90.

the petitioner has a legitimate interest in the proceedings, that such 
participation will not unduly delay the outcome, and it may contribute 
materially to the proper disposition of the issues.

feasible to explain specific plans and actions.
    (b) The Secretary provides notice to directly affected state,

<R05>
Sec. 144.101  Basis and purpose.

    (a) Part 146 of this subchapter implements sections 2701 through 
2723 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300gg, et 
seq.). Its purpose is to improve access to group health insurance 
coverage, guarantee the renewability of all coverage in the group 
market, provide certain protections for mothers and newborns with 
respect to coverage for hospital stays in connection with childbirth, 
and provide parity between the application of annual and lifetime dollar 
limits to mental health benefits and those limits for other health 
benefits and to provide certain protections for patients who elect 
breast reconstruction in connection with a mastectomy.
    (b) Part 148 of this subchapter implements sections 2741 through 
2763 of the PHS Act. Its purpose is to improve access to individual 
health insurance coverage for certain individuals who previously had 
group coverage, guarantee the renewability of all health insurance 
coverage in the individual market, and provide certain protections for 
mothers and newborns with respect to coverage for hospital stays in 
connection with childbirth, and to provide certain protections for 
patients who elect breast reconstruction in connection with a 
mastectomy.
    (c) Part 150 of this subchapter implements the enforcement 
provisions of sections 2722 and 2761 of the PHS Act with respect to the 
following:
    (1) States that fail to substantially enforce one or more provisions 
of part 146 concerning group health insurance or the requirements of 
part 148 of this subchapter concerning individual health insurance.
    (2) Insurance issuers in States described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section.
    (3) Group health plans that are non-Federal governmental plans.
    (d) Sections 2791 and 2792 of the PHS Act define terms used in the 
regulations in this subchapter and provide the basis for issuing these 
regulations.

[64 FR 45795, Aug. 20, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 144.102   Scope and applicability.

    (a) For purposes of 45 CFR parts 144 through 148, all health 
insurance coverage is generally divided into two markets--the group 
market (set forth in 45 CFR part 146) and the individual market (set 
forth in 45 CFR part 148). 45 CFR part 146 limits the group market to 
insurance sold to employment-related group health plans and further 
divides the group market into the large group market and the small group 
market. Federal law further defines the small group market as insurance 
sold to employer plans with 2 to 50 employees. State law, however, may 
expand the definition of the small group market to include certain 
coverage that would otherwise, under the Federal law, be considered 
coverage in the large group market or the individual market.
    (b) The protections afforded under 45 CFR parts 144 through 148 to 
individuals and employers (and other sponsors of health insurance 
offered in connection with a group health plan) are determined by 
whether the coverage involved is obtained in the small group market, the 
large group market, or the

[[Page 575]]

individual market. Small employers, and individuals who are eligible to 
enroll under the employer's plan, are guaranteed availability of 
insurance coverage sold in the small group market. Small and large 
employers are guaranteed the right to renew their group coverage, 
subject to certain exceptions. Eligible individuals are guaranteed 
availability of coverage sold in the individual market, and all coverage 
in the individual market must be guaranteed renewable. All coverage 
issued in the small or large group market, and in the individual market, 
must provide certain protections for mothers and newborns with respect 
to coverage for hospital stays in connection with childbirth.
    (c) Coverage that is provided to associations, but is not related to 
employment, is not considered group coverage under 45 CFR parts 144 
through 148. The coverage is considered coverage in the individual 
market, regardless of whether it is considered group coverage under 
State law.
    (d) Provisions relating to CMS enforcement of one or more provisions 
of part 146 or the requirements of part 148, or both, are contained in 
part 150 of this subchapter.

[62 FR 16955, Apr. 8, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 57558, Oct. 27, 1998; 64 
FR 45795, Aug. 20, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 144.103  Definitions.

officials designated by the State to enforce the requirements of 45 CFR 
parts 146 and 148 for the State involved with respect to the issuer.
    Beneficiary has the meaning given the term under section 3(8) of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which states,

benefit plan, who is or may become entitled to a benefit'' under the 
plan.
    Bona fide association means, with respect to health insurance 
coverage offered in a State, an association that meets the following

section 4980B insofar as it relates to pediatric vaccines), and Title 
XXII of the PHS Act.
    (4) Continuation coverage means coverage under a COBRA continuation 
provision or a similar State program. Coverage provided by a plan that 
is subject to a COBRA continuation provision or similar State program, 
but that does not satisfy all the requirements of that provision or

[[Page 576]]

 will be deemed to be continuation coverage if it allows an individual 
to elect to continue coverage for a period of at least 18 months. 
Continuation coverage does not include coverage under a conversion 
policy required to be offered to an individual upon exhaustion of 
continuation coverage, nor does it include continuation coverage under 
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
    (5) Exhaustion of COBRA continuation coverage means that an 
individual's COBRA continuation coverage ceases for any reason other 
than either failure of the individual to pay premiums on a timely basis, 
or for cause (such as making a fraudulent claim or an intentional 
misrepresentation of a material fact in connection with the plan). An 
individual is considered to have exhausted COBRA continuation coverage 
if such coverage ceases--
    (i) Due to the failure of the employer or other responsible entity 
to remit premiums on a timely basis; or

coverage available to the individual.
    (6) Exhaustion of continuation coverage means that an individual's 
continuation coverage ceases for any reason other than either failure of 
the individual to pay premiums on a timely basis, or for cause (such as 
making a fraudulent claim or an intentional misrepresentation of a

to have exhausted continuation coverage if--
    (i) Coverage ceases due to the failure of the employer or other 
responsible entity to remit premiums on a timely basis; or

choice of the individual) and there is no other continuation coverage 
available to the individual.

146.113(a).
    Eligible individual, for purposes of--
    (1) The group market provisions in 45 CFR part 146, subpart E, the 
term is defined in 45 CFR 146.150(b); and
    (2) The individual market provisions in 45 CFR part 148, the term is 
defined in 45 CFR 148.103.

in the interest of an employer, in relation to an employee benefit plan; 
and includes a group or association of employers acting for an employer 
in such capacity.''
    Enroll means to become covered for benefits under a group health 
plan (that is, when coverage becomes effective), without regard to when 
the individual may have completed or filed any forms that are required 
in order to enroll in the plan. For this purpose, an individual who has 
health insurance coverage under a group health plan is enrolled in the 
plan regardless of whether the individual elects coverage, the 
individual is a dependent who becomes covered as a result of an election 
by a participant, or the individual becomes covered without an election.
    Enrollment date definitions (enrollment date and first day of 
coverage) are set forth in 45 CFR 146.111(a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii).
    ERISA stands for the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).
    Excepted benefits, for purposes of the--
    (1) Group market provisions in 45 CFR part 146 subpart D, the term

dependents (as defined under the terms of the plan) directly or through 
insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise.
    Group market means the market for health insurance coverage offered

    Waiting period means the period that must pass before an employee or 
dependent is eligible to enroll under the terms of a group health plan. 
If an employee or dependent enrolls as a late enrollee or on a special 
enrollment date, any period before such late or special enrollment is 
not a waiting period. If an individual seeks and obtains coverage in the 
individual market, any period after the date the individual files a 
substantially complete application for coverage and before the first day 
of coverage is a waiting period.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 146.101  Basis and scope.

    (a) Statutory basis. This part implements sections 2701 through 2723 
of the PHS Act. Its purpose is to improve access to group health 
insurance coverage, to guarantee the renewability of all coverage in the 
group market, and to provide certain protections for mothers and 
newborns with respect to coverage for hospital stays in connection with 
childbirth. Sections 2791 and 2792 of the PHS Act define terms used in 
the regulations in this subchapter and provide the basis for issuing 
these regulations, respectively.
    (b) Scope. A group health plan or health insurance issuer offering 
group health insurance coverage may provide greater rights to 
participants and beneficiaries than those set forth in this part.
    (1) Subpart B. Subpart B of this part sets forth minimum 
requirements for group health plans and health insurance issuers 
offering group health insurance coverage concerning:
    (i) Limitations on a preexisting condition exclusion period.
    (ii) Certificates and disclosure of previous coverage.
    (iii) Methods of counting creditable coverage.
    (iv) Special enrollment periods.
    (v) Use of an affiliation period by an HMO as an alternative to a 
preexisting condition exclusion.
    (2) Subpart C. Subpart C of this part sets forth the requirements 
that apply to plans and issuers with respect to coverage for hospital 
stays in connection with childbirth. It also sets forth the regulations 
governing parity between medical/surgical benefits and mental health 
benefits in group health plans and health insurance coverage offered by 
issuers in connection with a group health plan.
    (3) Subpart D. Subpart D of this part sets forth exceptions to the 
requirements of Subpart B for certain plans and certain types of 
benefits.
    (4) Subpart E. Subpart E of this part implements sections 2711 
through 2713 of the PHS Act, which set forth requirements that apply 
only to health insurance issuers offering health insurance coverage in 
connection with a group health plan.
    (5) Subpart F. Subpart F of this part addresses the treatment of 
non-Federal governmental plans, and sets forth enforcement procedures.

Subpart B--Requirements Relating to Access and Renewability of Coverage, 
       and Limitations on Preexisting Condition Exclusion Periods


<R05>
Sec. 146.111  Limitations on preexisting condition exclusion periods.

    (a) Preexisting condition exclusion--(1) General. Subject to 
paragraph (b) of this section, a group health plan, and a health 
insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may impose, 
with respect to a participant or beneficiary, a preexisting condition 
exclusion only if the requirements of this paragraph (a) are satisfied.
    (1)(i) 6-month look-back rule. A preexisting condition exclusion 
must relate to a condition (whether physical or mental), regardless of 
the cause of the condition, for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, 
or treatment was recommended or received within the 6-month period 
ending on the enrollment date.
    (A) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i), medical advice, 
diagnosis, care, or treatment is taken into account only if it is 
recommended by, or received from, an individual licensed or similarly 
authorized to provide such services under State law and operating within 
the scope of practice authorized by State law.
    (B) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i), the 6-month period 
ending on the enrollment date begins on the 6-month anniversary date 
preceding the enrollment date. For example, for an enrollment date of 
August 1, 1998, the

[[Page 581]]

6-month period preceding the enrollment date is the period commencing on 
February 1, 1998 and continuing through July 31, 1998. As another 
example, for an enrollment date of August 30, 1998, the 6-month period 
preceding the enrollment date is the period commencing on February 28, 
1998 and continuing through August 29, 1998.
    (C) The following examples illustrate the requirements of this 
paragraph (a)(1)(i):

    Example 1: (i) Individual A is treated for a medical condition 7 
months before the enrollment date in Employer R's group health plan. As 
part of such treatment, A's physician recommends that a follow-up 
examination be given 2 months later. Despite this recommendation, A does 
not receive a follow-up examination and no other medical advice, 
diagnosis, care, or treatment for that condition is recommended to A or 
received by A during the 6-month period ending on A's enrollment date in 
Employer R's plan.
    (ii) In this Example, Employer R's plan may not impose a preexisting 
condition exclusion period with respect to the condition for which A 
received treatment 7 months prior to the enrollment date.
    Example 2: (i) Same facts as Example 1 except that Employer R's plan 
learns of the condition and attaches a rider to A's policy excluding 
coverage for the condition. Three months after enrollment, A's condition 
recurs, and Employer R's plan denies payment under the rider.
    (ii) In this Example, the rider is a preexisting condition exclusion 
and Employer R's plan may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion 
with respect to the condition for which A received treatment 7 months 
prior to the enrollment date.
    Example 3: (i) Individual B has asthma and is treated for that 
condition several times during the 6-month period before B's enrollment 
date in Employer S's plan. The plan imposes a 12-month preexisting 
condition exclusion. B has no prior creditable coverage to reduce the 
exclusion period. Three months after the enrollment date, B begins 
coverage under Employer S's plan. B is hospitalized for asthma.
    (ii) In this Example, Employer S's plan may exclude payment for the 
hospital stay and the physician services associated with this illness 
because the care is related to a medical condition for which treatment 
was received by B during the 6-month period before the enrollment date.
    Example 4: (i) Individual D, who is subject to a preexisting 
condition exclusion imposed by Employer U's plan, has diabetes, as well 
as a foot condition caused by poor circulation and retinal degeneration 
(both of which are conditions that may be directly attributed to 
diabetes). After enrolling in the plan, D stumbles and breaks a leg.
    (ii) In this Example, the leg fracture is not a condition related to 
D's diabetes, even though poor circulation in D's extremities and poor 
vision may have contributed towards the accident. However, any 
additional medical services that may be needed because of D's 
preexisting diabetic condition that would not be needed by another 
patient with a broken leg who does not have diabetes may be subject to 
the preexisting condition exclusion imposed under Employer U's plan.

    (ii) Maximum length of preexisting condition exclusion (the look-
forward rule). A preexisting condition exclusion is not permitted to 
extend for more than 12 months (18 months in the case of a late 
enrollee) after the enrollment date. For purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii), the 12-month and 18-month periods after the enrollment date 
are determined by reference to the anniversary of the enrollment date. 
For example, for an enrollment date of August 1, 1998, the 12-month 
period after the enrollment date is the period commencing on August 1, 
1998 and continuing through July 31, 1999.
    (iii) Reducing a preexisting condition exclusion period by 
creditable coverage. The period of any preexisting condition exclusion 
that would otherwise apply to an individual under a group health plan is 
reduced by the number of days of creditable coverage the individual has 
as of the enrollment date, as counted under Sec. 146.113. For purposes 
of this part, the phrase ``days of creditable coverage'' has the same 
meaning as the phrase ``the aggregate of the periods of creditable 
coverage'' as such phrase is used in section 2701(a)(3) of the PHS Act.
    (iv) Other standards. See Sec. 146.121 for other standards that may 
apply with respect to certain benefit limitations or restrictions under 
a group health plan.
    (2) Enrollment definitions--(i) Enrollment date means the first day 
of coverage or, if there is a waiting period, the first day of the 
waiting period.
    (ii) (A) First day of coverage means, in the case of an individual 
covered for benefits under a group health plan in the group market, the 
first day of coverage under the plan and, in the case of

[[Page 582]]

an individual covered by health insurance coverage in the individual 
market, the first day of coverage under the policy.
    (B) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:

    Example: (i) Employer V's group health plan provides for coverage to 
begin on the first day of the first payroll period following the date an 
employee is hired and completes the applicable enrollment forms, or on 
any subsequent January 1 after completion of the applicable enrollment 
forms. Employer V's plan imposes a preexisting condition exclusion for 
12 months (reduced by the individual's creditable coverage) following an 
individual's enrollment date. Employee E is hired by Employer V on 
October 13, 1998 and then on October 14, 1998 completes and files all 
the forms necessary to enroll in the plan. E's coverage under the plan 
becomes effective on October 25, 1998 (which is the beginning of the 
first payroll period after E's date of hire).
    (ii) In this Example, E's enrollment date is October 13, 1998 (which 
is the first day of the waiting period for E's enrollment and is also 
E's date of hire). Accordingly, with respect to E, the 6-month period in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) would be the period from April 13, 1998 through 
October 12, 1998, the maximum permissible period during which Employer 
V's plan could apply a preexisting condition exclusion under paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) would be the period from October 13, 1998 through October 12, 
1999, and this period would be reduced under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) by 
E's days of creditable coverage as of October 13, 1998.

    (iii) Late enrollee means an individual whose enrollment in a plan 
is a late enrollment.
    (iv) Late enrollment means enrollment under a group health plan 
other than on--
    (A) The earliest date on which coverage can become effective under 
the terms of the plan; or
    (B) A special enrollment date for the individual. If an individual 
ceases to be eligible for coverage under the plan by terminating 
employment, and subsequently becomes eligible for coverage under the 
plan by resuming employment, only eligibility during the individual's 
most recent period of employment is taken into account in determining 
whether the individual is a late enrollee under the plan with respect to 
the most recent period of coverage. Similar rules apply if an individual 
again becomes eligible for coverage following a suspension of coverage 
that applied generally under the plan.
    (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate the requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(2):

    Example 1: (i) Employee F first becomes eligible to be covered by 
Employer W's group health plan on January 1, 1999, but elects not to 
enroll in the plan until April 1, 1999. April 1, 1999 is not a special 
enrollment date for F.
    (ii) In this Example, F would be a late enrollee with respect to F's 
coverage that became effective under the plan on April 1, 1999.
    Example 2: (i) Same as Example 1, except that F does not enroll in 
the plan on April 1, 1999 and terminates employment with Employer W on 
July 1, 1999, without having had any health insurance coverage under the 
plan. F is rehired by Employer W on January 1, 2000 and is eligible for 
and elects coverage under Employer W's plan effective on January 1, 
2000.
    (ii) In this Example, F would not be a late enrollee with respect to 
F's coverage that became effective on January 1, 2000.

    (b) Exceptions pertaining to preexisting condition exclusions--(1) 
Newborns--(i) General rule. Subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health 
insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion 
with regard to a child who, as of the last day of the 30-day period 
beginning with the date of birth, is covered under any creditable 
coverage. Accordingly, if a newborn is enrolled in a group health plan 
(or other creditable coverage) within 30 days after birth and 
subsequently enrolls in another group health plan without a significant 
break in coverage, the other plan may not impose any preexisting 
condition exclusion with regard to the child.
    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (b)(1):

    Example: (i) Seven months after enrollment in Employer W's group 
health plan, Individual E has a child born with a birth defect. Because 
the child is enrolled in Employer W's plan within 30 days of birth, no 
preexisting condition exclusion may be imposed with respect to the child 
under Employer W's plan. Three months after the child's birth, E 
commences employment with Employer X and enrolls with the child in 
Employer X's plan within 45 days of leaving Employer W's plan. Employer 
X's plan imposes a 12-month exclusion for any preexisting condition.

[[Page 583]]

    (ii) In this Example, Employer X's plan may not impose any 
preexisting condition exclusion with respect to E's child because the 
child was covered within 30 days of birth and had no significant break 
in coverage. This result applies regardless of whether E's child is 
included in the certificate of creditable coverage provided to E by 
Employer W indicating 300 days of dependent coverage or receives a 
separate certificate indicating 90 days of coverage. Employer X's plan 
may impose a preexisting condition exclusion with respect to E for up to 
65 days for any preexisting condition of E for which medical advice, 
diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received by E within 
the 6-month period ending on E's enrollment date in Employer X's plan.

    (2) Adopted children. Subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a 
group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health 
insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion 
in the case of a child who is adopted or placed for adoption before 
attaining 18 years of age and who, as of the last day of the 30-day 
period beginning on the date of the adoption or placement for adoption, 
is covered under creditable coverage. This rule does not apply to 
coverage before the date of such adoption or placement for adoption.
    (3) Break in coverage. Paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section 
no longer apply to a child after a significant break in coverage.
    (4) Pregnancy. A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer 
offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose a preexisting 
condition exclusion relating to pregnancy as a preexisting condition.
    (5) Special enrollment dates. For special enrollment dates relating 
to new dependents, see Sec. 146.117(b).
    (c) Notice of plan's preexisting condition exclusion. A group health 
plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance 
under the plan, may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion with 
respect to a participant or dependent of the participant before 
notifying the participant, in writing, of the existence and terms of any 
preexisting condition exclusion under the plan and of the rights of 
individuals to demonstrate creditable coverage (and any applicable 
waiting periods) as required by Sec. 146.115. The description of the 
rights of individuals to demonstrate creditable coverage includes a 
description of the right of the individual to request a certificate from 
a prior plan or issuer, if necessary, and a statement that the current 
plan or issuer will assist in obtaining a certificate from any prior 
plan or issuer, if necessary.

[62 FR 16958, Apr. 8, 1997; 62 FR 31670, 31693, June 10, 1997, as 
amended at 62 FR 35906, July 2, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 146.113  Rules relating to creditable coverage.

    (a) General rules--(1) Creditable coverage. For purposes of this 
section, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2), the term creditable 
coverage means coverage of an individual under any of the following:
    (i) A group health plan as defined in Sec. 144.103.
    (ii) Health insurance coverage as defined in Sec. 144.103 (whether 
or not the entity offering the coverage is subject to the requirements 
of this part and 45 CFR part 148, and without regard to whether the 
coverage is offered in the group market, the individual market, or 
otherwise).
    (iii) Part A or part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act 
(Medicare).
    (iv) Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid), other than 
coverage consisting solely of benefits under section 1928 of the Social 
Security Act (the program for distribution of pediatric vaccines).
    (v) Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 55 (medical and dental care for members 
and certain former members of the uniformed services, and for their 
dependents; for purposes of title 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, uniformed 
services means the armed forces and the Commissioned Corps of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and of the Public Health 
Service).
    (vi) A medical care program of the Indian Health Service or of a 
tribal organization.
    (vii) A State health benefits risk pool. For purposes of this 
section, a State health benefits risk pool means--
    (A) An organization qualifying under section 501(c)(26) of the Code;

[[Page 584]]

    (B) A qualified high risk pool described in section 2744(c)(2) of 
the PHS Act; or
    (C) Any other arrangement sponsored by a State, the membership 
composition of which is specified by the State and which is established 
and maintained primarily to provide health insurance coverage for 
individuals who are residents of such State and who, by reason of the 
existence or history of a medical condition--
    (1) Are unable to acquire medical care coverage for such condition 
through insurance or from an HMO; or
    (2) Are able to acquire such coverage only at a rate which is 
substantially in excess of the rate for such coverage through the 
membership organization.
    (viii) A health plan offered under title 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 (the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program).
    (ix) A public health plan. For purposes of this section, a public 
health plan means any plan established or maintained by a State, county, 
or other political subdivision of a State that provides health insurance 
coverage to individuals who are enrolled in the plan.
    (x) A health benefit plan under section 5(e) of the Peace Corps Act 
(22 U.S.C. 2504(e)).
    (2) Excluded coverage. Creditable coverage does not include coverage 
consisting solely of coverage of excepted benefits (described in Sec. 
146.145).
    (3) Methods of counting creditable coverage. For purposes of 
reducing any preexisting condition exclusion period, as provided under 
Sec. 146.111(a)(1)(iii), a group health plan, and a health insurance 
issuer offering group health insurance coverage, determines the amount 
of an individual's creditable coverage by using the standard method 
described in paragraph (b), except that the plan, or issuer, may use the 
alternative method under paragraph (c) with respect to any or all of the 
categories of benefits described under paragraph (c)(3).
    (b) Standard method--(1) Specific benefits not considered. Under the 
standard method, a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer 
offering group health insurance coverage, determines the amount of 
creditable coverage without regard to the specific benefits included in 
the coverage.
    (2) Counting creditable coverage--(i) Based on days. For purposes of 
reducing the preexisting condition exclusion period, a group health 
plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance 
coverage, determines the amount of creditable coverage by counting all 
the days that the individual has under one or more types of creditable 
coverage. Accordingly, if on a particular day, an individual has 
creditable coverage from more than one source, all the creditable 
coverage on that day is counted as one day. Further, any days in a 
waiting period for a plan or policy are not creditable coverage under 
the plan or policy.
    (ii) Days not counted before significant break in coverage. Days of 
creditable coverage that occur before a significant break in coverage 
are not required to be counted.
    (iii) Definition of significant break in coverage. A significant 
break in coverage means a period of 63 consecutive days during all of 
which the individual does not have any creditable coverage, except that 
neither a waiting period nor an affiliation period is taken into account 
in determining a significant break in coverage. (See section 
731(b)(2)(iii) of ERISA and section 2723(b)(2)(iii) of the PHS Act, 
which exclude from preemption State insurance laws that require a break 
of more than 63 days before an individual has a significant break in 
coverage for purposes of State law.)
    (iv) Examples. The following examples illustrate how creditable 
coverage is counted in reducing preexisting condition exclusion periods:

    Example 1: (i) Individual A works for Employer P and has creditable 
coverage under Employer P's plan for 18 months before A's employment 
terminates. A is hired by Employer O, and enrolls in Employer O's group 
health plan, 64 days after the last date of coverage under Employer P's 
plan. Employer O's plan has a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion 
period.
    (ii) In this Example, because A had a break in coverage of 63 days, 
Employer O's plan may disregard A's prior coverage and A may be subject 
to a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion period.
    Example 2: (i) Same facts as Example 1, except that A is hired by 
Employer O, and enrolls in Employer O's plan, on the 63rd day

[[Page 585]]

after the last date of coverage under Employer P's plan.
    (ii) In this Example, A has a break in coverage of 62 days. Because 
A's break in coverage is not a significant break in coverage, Employer 
O's plan must count A's prior creditable coverage for purposes of 
reducing the plan's preexisting condition exclusion period as it applies 
to A.
    Example 3: (i) Same facts as Example 1, except that Employer O's 
plan provides benefits through an insurance policy that, as required by 
applicable State insurance laws, defines a significant break in coverage 
as 90 days.
    (ii) In this Example, the issuer that provides group health 
insurance to Employer O's plan must count A's period of creditable 
coverage prior to the 63-day break.
    Example 4: (i) Same facts as Example 3, except that Employer O's 
plan is a self-insured plan, and thus is not subject to State insurance 
laws.
    (ii) In this Example, the plan is not governed by the longer break 
rules under State insurance law and A's previous coverage may be 
disregarded.
    Example 5: (i) Individual B begins employment with Employer R 45 
days after terminating coverage under a prior group health plan. 
Employer R's group health plan has a 30-day waiting period before 
coverage begins. B enrolls in Employer R's plan when first eligible.
    (ii) In this Example, B does not have a significant break in 
coverage for purposes of determining whether B's prior coverage must be 
counted by Employer R's plan. B has only a 44-day break in coverage 
because the 30-day waiting period is not taken into account in 
determining a significant break in coverage.
    Example 6: (i) Individual C works for Employer S and has creditable 
coverage under Employer S's plan for 200 days before C's employment is 
terminated and coverage ceases. C is then unemployed and does not have 
any creditable coverage for 51 days before being hired by Employer T. 
Employer T's plan has a 3-month waiting period. C works for Employer T 
for 2 months and then terminates employment. Eleven days after 
terminating employment with Employer T, C begins working for Employer U. 
Employer U's plan has no waiting period, but has a 6-month preexisting 
condition exclusion period.
    (ii) In this Example, C does not have a significant break in 
coverage because, after disregarding the waiting period under Employer 
T's plan, C had only a 62-day break in coverage (51 days plus 11 days). 
Accordingly, C has 200 days of creditable coverage and Employer U's plan 
may not apply its 6-month preexisting condition exclusion period with 
respect to C.
    Example 7: (i) Individual D terminates employment with Employer V on 
January 13, 1998 after being covered for 24 months under Employer V's 
group health plan. On March 17, the 63rd day without coverage, D applies 
for a health insurance policy in the individual market. D's application 
is accepted and the coverage is made effective May 1.
    (ii) In this Example, because D applied for the policy before the 
end of the 63rd day, and coverage under the policy ultimately became 
effective, the period between the date of application and the first day 
of coverage is a waiting period, and no significant break in coverage 
occurred even though the actual period without coverage was 107 days.
    Example 8: (i) Same facts as Example 7, except that D's application 
for a policy in the individual market is denied.
    (ii) In this Example, because D did not obtain coverage following 
application, D incurred a significant break in coverage on the 64th day.

    (v) Other permissible counting methods--(A) General rule. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph (b)(2), for 
purposes of reducing a preexisting condition exclusion period (but not 
for purposes of issuing a certificate under Sec. 146.115), a group 
health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health 
insurance coverage, may determine the amount of creditable coverage in 
any other manner that is at least as favorable to the individual as the 
method set forth in this paragraph (b)(2), subject to the requirements 
of other applicable law.
    (B) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (b)(2)(v):

    Example: (i) Individual F has coverage under Group Health Plan Y 
from January 3, 1997 through March 25, 1997. F then becomes covered by 
Group Health Plan Z. F's enrollment date in Plan Z is May 1, 1997. Plan 
Z has a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion period.
    (ii) In this Example, Plan Z may determine, in accordance with the 
rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii), that F has 82 
days of creditable coverage (29 days in January, 28 days in February, 
and 25 days in March). Thus, the preexisting condition exclusion period 
will no longer apply to F on February 8, 1998 (82 days before the 12-
month anniversary of F's enrollment (May 1)). For administrative 
convenience, however, Plan Z may consider that the preexisting condition 
exclusion period will no longer apply to F on the first day of the month 
(February 1).

    (c) Alternative method--(1) Specific benefits considered. Under the 
alternative method, a group health plan, or a

[[Page 586]]

health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, 
determines the amount of creditable coverage based on coverage within 
any category of benefits described in paragraph (c)(3) and not based on 
coverage for any other benefits. The plan or issuer may use the 
alternative method for any or all of the categories. The plan may apply 
a different preexisting condition exclusion period with respect to each 
category (and may apply a different preexisting condition exclusion 
period for benefits that are not within any category). The creditable 
coverage determined for a category of benefits applies only for purposes 
of reducing the preexisting condition exclusion period with respect to 
that category. An individual's creditable coverage for benefits that are 
not within any category for which the alternative method is being used 
is determined under the standard method of paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (2) Uniform application. A plan or issuer using the alternative 
method is required to apply it uniformly to all participants and 
beneficiaries under the plan or policy. The use of the alternative 
method is set forth in the plan.
    (3) Categories of benefits. The alternative method for counting 
creditable coverage may be used for coverage for any of the following 
categories of benefits:
    (i) Mental health.
    (ii) Substance abuse treatment.
    (iii) Prescription drugs.
    (iv) Dental care.
    (v) Vision care.
    (4) Plan notice. If the alternative method is used, the plan is 
required to--
    (i) State prominently that the plan is using the alternative method 
of counting creditable coverage in disclosure statements concerning the 
plan, and state this to each enrollee at the time of enrollment under 
the plan; and
    (ii) Include in these statements a description of the effect of 
using the alternative method, including an identification of the 
categories used.
    (5) Issuer notice. With respect to health insurance coverage offered 
by an issuer in the small or large group market, if the insurance 
coverage uses the alternative method, the issuer states prominently in 
any disclosure statement concerning the coverage, and to each employer 
at the time of the offer or sale of the coverage, that the issuer is 
using the alternative method, and includes in such statements a 
description of the effect of using the alternative method. This applies 
separately to each type of coverage offered by the health insurance 
issuer.
    (6) Disclosure of information on previous benefits. See Sec. 
146.115(b) for special rules concerning disclosure of coverage to a 
plan, or issuer, using the alternative method of counting creditable 
coverage under this paragraph (c).
    (7) Counting creditable coverage--(i) General. Under the alternative 
method, the group health plan or issuer counts creditable coverage 
within a category if any level of benefits is provided within the 
category. Coverage under a reimbursement account or arrangement, such as 
a flexible spending arrangement (as defined in section 106(c)(2) of the 
Internal Revenue Code), does not constitute coverage within any 
category.
    (ii) Special rules. In counting an individual's creditable coverage 
under the alternative method, the group health plan, or issuer, first 
determines the amount of the individual's creditable coverage that may 
be counted under paragraph (b) of this section, up to a total of 365 
days of the most recent creditable coverage (546 days for a late 
enrollee). The period over which this creditable coverage is determined 
is referred to as the ``determination period.'' Then, for the category 
specified under the alternative method, the plan or issuer counts within 
the category all days of coverage that occurred during the determination 
period (whether or not a significant break in coverage for that category 
occurs), and reduces the individual's preexisting condition exclusion 
period for that category by that number of days. The plan or issuer may 
determine the amount of creditable coverage in any other reasonable 
manner, uniformly applied, that is at least as favorable to the 
individual.
    (iii) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (c)(7):


[[Page 587]]


    Example: (i) Individual D enrolls in Employer V's plan on January 1, 
2001. Coverage under the plan includes prescription drug benefits. On 
April 1, 2001, the plan ceases providing prescription drug benefits. D's 
employment with Employer V ends on January 1, 2002, after D was covered 
under Employer V's group health plan for 365 days. D enrolls in Employer 
Y's plan on February 1, 2001 (D's enrollment date). Employer Y's plan 
uses the alternative method of counting creditable coverage and imposes 
a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion on prescription drug 
benefits.
    (ii) In this Example, Employer Y's plan may impose a 275-day 
preexisting condition exclusion with respect to D for prescription drug 
benefits because D had 90 days of creditable coverage relating to 
prescription drug benefits within D's determination period.

<R05>
Sec. 146.115  Certification and disclosure of previous coverage.

    (a) Certificate of creditable coverage--(1) Entities required to 
provide certificate--(i) General. A group health plan, and each health 
insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage under a group 
health plan, is required to furnish certificates of creditable coverage 
in accordance with this paragraph (a).
    (ii) Duplicate certificates not required. An entity required to 
provide a certificate under this paragraph (a)(1) for an individual is 
deemed to have satisfied the certification requirements for that 
individual if another party provides the certificate, but only to the 
extent that information relating to the individual's creditable coverage 
and waiting or affiliation period is provided by the other party. For 
example, in the case of a group health plan funded through an insurance 
policy, the issuer is deemed to have satisfied the certification 
requirement with respect to a participant or beneficiary if the plan 
actually provides a certificate that includes the information required 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section with respect to the participant 
or beneficiary.
    (iii) Special rule for group health plans. To the extent coverage 
under a plan consists of group health insurance coverage, the plan is 
deemed to have satisfied the certification requirements under this 
paragraph (a)(1) if any issuer offering the coverage is required to 
provide the certificates pursuant to an agreement between the plan and 
the issuer. For example, if there is an agreement between an issuer and 
the plan sponsor under which the issuer agrees to provide certificates 
for individuals covered under the plan, and the issuer fails to provide 
a certificate to an individual when the plan would have been required to 
provide one under this paragraph (a), then the issuer, but not the plan, 
violates the certification requirements of this paragraph (a).
    (iv) Special rules for issuers--(A) Responsibility of issuer for 
coverage period--(1) General rule. An issuer is not required to provide 
information regarding coverage provided to an individual by another 
party.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A):

    Example. (i) A plan offers coverage with an HMO option from one 
issuer and an indemnity option from a different issuer. The HMO has not 
entered into an agreement with the plan to provide certificates as 
permitted under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) In this Example, if an employee switches from the indemnity 
option to the HMO option and later ceases to be covered under the plan, 
any certificate provided by the HMO is not required to provide 
information regarding the employee's coverage under the indemnity 
option.

    (B) Cessation of issuer coverage prior to cessation of coverage 
under a plan--(1) General rule. If an individual's coverage under an 
issuer's policy ceases before the individual's coverage under the plan 
ceases, the issuer is required to provide sufficient information to the 
plan (or to another party designated by the plan) to enable a 
certificate to be provided by the plan (or other party), after cessation 
of the individual's coverage under the plan, that reflects the period of 
coverage under the policy. The provision of that information to the plan 
will satisfy the issuer's obligation to provide an automatic certificate 
for that period of creditable coverage for the individual under 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3) of this section. In addition, an issuer 
providing that information is required to cooperate with the plan in 
responding to any request made under paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
(relating to the alternative

[[Page 588]]

method of counting creditable coverage). If the individual's coverage 
under the plan ceases at the time the individual's coverage under the 
issuer's policy ceases, the issuer must provide an automatic certificate 
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. An issuer may presume that 
an individual whose coverage ceases at a time other than the effective 
date for changing enrollment options has ceased to be covered under the 
plan.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B):

    Example: (i) A group health plan provides coverage under an HMO 
option and an indemnity option with a different issuer, and only allows 
employees to switch on each January 1. Neither the HMO nor the indemnity 
issuer has entered into an agreement with the plan to provide 
certificates as permitted under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) In this Example, if an employee switches from the indemnity 
option to the HMO option on January 1, the issuer must provide the plan 
(or a person designated by the plan) with appropriate information with 
respect to the individual's coverage with the indemnity issuer. However, 
if the individual's coverage with the indemnity issuer ceases at a date 
other than January 1, the issuer is instead required to provide the 
individual with an automatic certificate.

    (2) Individuals for whom a certificate must be provided; timing of 
issuance--(i) Individuals. A certificate must be provided, without 
charge, for participants or dependents who are or were covered under a 
group health plan upon the occurrence of any of the events described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Issuance of automatic certificates. The certificates described 
in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii) are referred to as ``automatic 
certificates.''
    (A) Qualified beneficiaries upon a qualifying event. In the case of 
an individual who is a qualified beneficiary (as defined in section 
607(3) of ERISA, section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code, or section 2208 of the 
PHS Act) entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage, an automatic 
certificate is required to be provided at the time the individual would 
lose coverage under the plan in the absence of COBRA continuation 
coverage or alternative coverage elected instead of COBRA continuation 
coverage. A plan or issuer satisfies this requirement if it provides the 
automatic certificate no later than the time a notice is required to be 
furnished for a qualifying event under section 606 of ERISA, section 
4980B(f)(6) of the Code and section 2206 of the PHS Act (relating to 
notices required under COBRA).
    (B) Other individuals when coverage ceases. In the case of an 
individual who is not a qualified beneficiary entitled to elect COBRA 
continuation coverage, an automatic certificate is required to be 
provided at the time the individual ceases to be covered under the plan. 
A plan or issuer satisfies this requirement if it provides the automatic 
certificate within a reasonable time period thereafter. In the case of 
an individual who is entitled to elect to continue coverage under a 
State program similar to COBRA and who receives the automatic 
certificate not later than the time a notice is required to be furnished 
under the State program, the certificate is deemed to be provided within 
a reasonable time period after the cessation of coverage under the plan.
    (C) Qualified beneficiaries when COBRA ceases. In the case of an 
individual who is a qualified beneficiary and has elected COBRA 
continuation coverage (or whose coverage has continued after the 
individual became entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage), an 
automatic certificate is to be provided at the time the individual's 
coverage under the plan ceases. A plan, or issuer, satisfies this 
requirement if it provides the automatic certificate within a reasonable 
time after coverage ceases (or after the expiration of any grace period 
for nonpayment of premiums). An automatic certificate is required to be 
provided to such an individual regardless of whether the individual has 
previously received an automatic certificate under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (iii) Any individual upon request. Requests for certificates are 
permitted to be made by, or on behalf of, an individual within 24 months 
after coverage ceases. Thus, for example, a plan in which an individual 
enrolls may, if authorized by the individual, request a

[[Page 589]]

certificate of the individual's creditable coverage on behalf of the 
individual from a plan in which the individual was formerly enrolled. 
After the request is received, a plan or issuer is required to provide 
the certificate by the earliest date that the plan or issuer, acting in 
a reasonable and prompt fashion, can provide the certificate. A 
certificate is to be provided under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) even if 
the individual has previously received a certificate under this 
paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or an automatic certificate under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Examples. The following examples illustrate the requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(2):

    Example 1: (i) Individual A terminates employment with Employer O. A 
is a qualified beneficiary entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage 
under Employer O's group health plan. A notice of the rights provided 
under COBRA is typically furnished to qualified beneficiaries under the 
plan within 10 days after a covered employee terminates employment.
    (ii) In this Example, the automatic certificate may be provided at 
the same time that A is provided the COBRA notice.
    Example 2: (i) Same facts as Example 1, except that the automatic 
certificate for A is not completed by the time the COBRA notice is 
furnished to A.
    (ii) In this Example, the automatic certificate may be provided 
within the period permitted by law for the delivery of notices under 
COBRA.
    Example 3: (i) Employer R maintains an insured group health plan. R 
has never had 20 employees and thus R's plan is not subject to the COBRA 
continuation coverage provisions. However, R is in a State that has a 
State program similar to COBRA. B terminates employment with R and loses 
coverage under R's plan.
    (ii) In this Example, the automatic certificate may be provided not 
later than the time a notice is required to be furnished under the State 
program.
    Example 4: (i) Individual C terminates employment with Employer S 
and receives both a notice of C's rights under COBRA and an automatic 
certificate. C elects COBRA continuation coverage under Employer S's 
group health plan. After four months of COBRA continuation coverage and 
the expiration of a 30-day grace period, Employer S's group health plan 
determines that C's COBRA continuation coverage has ceased due to 
failure to make a timely payment for continuation coverage.
    (ii) In this Example, the plan must provide an updated automatic 
certificate to C within a reasonable time after the end of the grace 
period.
    Example 5: (i) Individual D is currently covered under the group 
health plan of Employer T. D requests a certificate, as permitted under 
paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Under the procedure for Employer 
T's plan, certificates are mailed (by first class mail) 7 business days 
following receipt of the request. This date reflects the earliest date 
that the plan, acting in a reasonable and prompt fashion, can provide 
certificates.
    (ii) In this Example, the plan's procedure satisfies paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section.

    (3) Form and content of certificate--(i) Written certificate--(A) 
General. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section, 
the certificate must be provided in writing (including any form approved 
by CMS as a writing).
    (B) Other permissible forms. No written certificate is required to 
be provided under this paragraph (a) with respect to a particular event 
described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section if 
all the following conditions are met:
    (1) An individual is entitled to receive a certificate.
    (2) The individual requests that the certificate be sent to another 
plan or issuer instead of to the individual.
    (3) The plan or issuer that would otherwise receive the certificate 
agrees to accept the information in this paragraph (a)(3) through means 
other than a written certificate (for example, by telephone).
    (4) The receiving plan or issuer receives the information from the 
sending plan or issuer in such form within the time periods required 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Required information. The certificate must include all of the 
following:
    (A) The date the certificate is issued.
    (B) The name of the group health plan that provided the coverage 
described in the certificate.
    (C) The name of the participant or dependent with respect to whom 
the certificate applies, and any other information necessary for the 
plan providing the coverage specified in the certificate to identify the 
individual, such as the individual's identification number under the 
plan and the name of the participant if the certificate is for (or 
includes) a dependent.

[[Page 590]]

    (D) The name, address, and telephone number of the plan 
administrator or issuer required to provide the certificate.
    (E) The telephone number to call for further information regarding 
the certificate (if different from paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(D)).
    (F) Either--
    (1) A statement that an individual has at least 18 months (for this 
purpose, 546 days is deemed to be 18 months) of creditable coverage, 
disregarding days of creditable coverage before a significant break in 
coverage, or
    (2) The date any waiting period (and affiliation period, if 
applicable) began and the date creditable coverage began.
    (G) The date creditable coverage ended, unless the certificate 
indicates that creditable coverage is continuing as of the date of the 
certificate.
    (iii) Periods of coverage under certificate. If an automatic 
certificate is provided under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
period that must be included on the certificate is the last period of 
continuous coverage ending on the date coverage ceased. If an individual 
requests a certificate under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, a 
certificate must be provided for each period of continuous coverage 
ending within the 24-month period ending on the date of the request (or 
continuing on the date of the request). A separate certificate may be 
provided for each such period of continuous coverage.
    (iv) Combining information for families. A certificate may provide 
information with respect to both a participant and the participant's 
dependents if the information is identical for each individual or, if 
the information is not identical, certificates may be provided on one 
form if the form provides all the required information for each 
individual and separately states the information that is not identical.
    (v) Model certificate. The requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section are satisfied if the plan or issuer provides a certificate 
in accordance with a model certificate authorized by CMS.
    (vi) Excepted benefits; categories of benefits. No certificate is 
required to be furnished with respect to excepted benefits described in 
Sec. 146.145. In addition, the information in the certificate regarding 
coverage is not required to specify categories of benefits described in 
Sec. 146.113(c) (relating to the alternative method of counting 
creditable coverage). However, if excepted benefits are provided 
concurrently with other creditable coverage (so that the coverage does 
not consist solely of excepted benefits), information concerning the 
benefits may be required to be disclosed under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (4) Procedures--(i) Method of delivery. The certificate is required 
to be provided to each individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section or an entity requesting the certificate on behalf of the 
individual. The certificate may be provided by first-class mail. If the 
certificate or certificates are provided to the participant and the 
participant's spouse at the participant's last known address, then the 
requirements of this paragraph (a)(4) are satisfied with respect to all 
individuals residing at that address. If a dependent's last known 
address is different than the participant's last known address, a 
separate certificate is required to be provided to the dependent at the 
dependent's last known address. If separate certificates are being 
provided by mail to individuals who reside at the same address, separate 
mailings of each certificate are not required.
    (ii) Procedure for requesting certificates. A plan or issuer must 
establish a procedure for individuals to request and receive 
certificates under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Designated recipients. If an automatic certificate is required 
to be provided under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, and the 
individual entitled to receive the certificate designates another 
individual or entity to receive the certificate, the plan or issuer 
responsible for providing the certificate is permitted to provide the 
certificate to the designated party. If a certificate is required to be 
provided upon request under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section and 
the individual entitled to receive the certificate designates another 
individual or entity to receive the certificate, the plan or issuer 
responsible for providing the certificate is required

[[Page 591]]

to provide the certificate to the designated party.
    (5) Special rules concerning dependent coverage--(i) Reasonable 
efforts--(A) General rule. A plan or issuer is required to use 
reasonable efforts to determine any information needed for a certificate 
relating to dependent coverage. In any case in which an automatic 
certificate is required to be furnished with respect to a dependent 
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, no individual certificate is 
required to be furnished until the plan or issuer knows (or making 
reasonable efforts should know) of the dependent's cessation of coverage 
under the plan.
    (B) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(5)(i):

    Example: (i) A group health plan covers employees and their 
dependents. The plan annually requests all employees to provide updated 
information regarding dependents, including the specific date on which 
an employee has a new dependent or on which a person ceases to be a 
dependent of the employee.
    (ii) In this Example, the plan has satisfied the standard in this 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) that it make reasonable efforts to determine the 
cessation of dependents' coverage and the related dependent coverage 
information.

    (ii) Special rules for demonstrating coverage. If a certificate 
furnished by a plan or issuer does not provide the name of any dependent 
of an individual covered by the certificate, the individual may, if 
necessary, use the procedures described in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section for demonstrating dependent status. In addition, an individual 
may, if necessary, use these procedures to demonstrate that a child was 
enrolled within 30 days of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. 
See Sec. 146.111(b), under which such a child would not be subject to a 
preexisting condition exclusion.
    (iii) Transition rule for dependent coverage through June 30, 1998--
(A) General. A group health plan or health insurance issuer that cannot 
provide the names of dependents (or related coverage information) for 
purposes of providing a certificate of coverage for a dependent may 
satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section by 
providing the name of the participant covered by the group health plan 
or health insurance issuer and specifying that the type of coverage 
described in the certificate is for dependent coverage (for example, 
family coverage or employee-plus-spouse coverage).
    (B) Certificates provided on request. For purposes of certificates 
provided on the request of, or on behalf of, an individual under 
paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, a plan or issuer must make 
reasonable efforts to obtain and provide the names of any dependent 
covered by the certificate where such information is requested to be 
provided. If a certificate does not include the name of any dependent of 
an individual covered by the certificate, the individual may, if 
necessary, use the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section 
for submitting documentation to establish that the creditable coverage 
in the certificate applies to the dependent.
    (C) Demonstrating a dependent's creditable coverage. See paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section for special rules to demonstrate dependent 
status.
    (D) Duration. This paragraph (a)(5)(iii) is only effective for 
certifications provided with respect to events occurring through June 
30, 1998.
    (6) Special certification rules--(i) Issuers. Issuers of group and 
individual health insurance are required to provide certificates of any 
creditable coverage they provide in the group or individual health 
insurance market, even if the coverage is provided in connection with an 
entity or program that is not itself required to provide a certificate 
because it is not subject to the group market provisions of this part, 
part 7 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, or chapter 100 of subtitle K 
of the Internal Revenue Code. This would include coverage provided in 
connection with any of the following:
    (A) Creditable coverage described in sections 2701 (c)(1)(G) through 
(c)(1)(J) of the PHS Act (coverage under a State health benefits risk 
pool, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, a public health 
plan, and a health benefit plan under section 5(e) of the Peace Corps 
Act).
    (B) Coverage subject to section 2721(b)(1)(B) of the PHS Act 
(requiring certificates by issuers offering health

[[Page 592]]

insurance coverage in connection with any group health plan, including a 
church plan or a governmental plan (including the Federal Employees 
Health Benefits Program (FEHBP)).
    (C) Coverage subject to section 2743 of the PHS Act applicable to 
health insurance issuers in the individual market. (However, this 
section does not require a certificate to be provided with respect to 
short-term, limited duration insurance, which is excluded from the 
definition of ``individual health insurance coverage'' in 45 CFR 144.103 
that is not provided in connection with a group health plan, as 
described in paragraph (a)(6)(i)(B) of this section.)
    (ii) Other entities. For special rules requiring that certain other 
entities, not subject to this part, provide certificates consistent with 
the rules in this section, see section 2791(a)(3) of the PHS Act 
applicable to entities described in sections 2701(c)(1)(C), (D), (E), 
and (F) of the PHS Act (relating to Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS, and 
Indian Health Service), section 2721(b)(1)(A) of the PHS Act applicable 
to non-Federal governmental plans generally, section 2721(b)(2)(C)(ii) 
of the PHS Act applicable to non-Federal governmental plans that elect 
to be excluded from the requirements of subparts 1 through 3 of part A 
of title XXVII of the PHS Act, and section 9805(a) of the Internal 
Revenue Code applicable to group health plans, which includes church 
plans (as defined in section 414(e) of the Internal Revenue Code).
    (b) Disclosure of coverage to a plan, or issuer, using the 
alternative method of counting creditable coverage--(1) General. If an 
individual enrolls in a group health plan with respect to which the 
plan, or issuer, uses the alternative method of counting creditable 
coverage described in section 2701(c)(3)(B) of the PHS Act and Sec. 
146.113(c), the individual provides a certificate of coverage under 
paragraph (a) of this section, and the plan or issuer in which the 
individual enrolls so requests, the entity that issued the certificate 
(the ``prior entity'') is required to disclose promptly to a requesting 
plan or issuer (the ``requesting entity'') the information set forth in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Information to be disclosed. The prior entity is required to 
identify to the requesting entity the categories of benefits with 
respect to which the requesting entity is using the alternative method 
of counting creditable coverage, and the requesting entity may identify 
specific information that the requesting entity reasonably needs in 
order to determine the individual's creditable coverage with respect to 
any such category. The prior entity is required to disclose promptly to 
the requesting entity the creditable coverage information so requested.
    (3) Charge for providing information. The prior entity furnishing 
the information under paragraph (b) of this section may charge the 
requesting entity for the reasonable cost of disclosing such 
information.
    (c) Ability of an individual to demonstrate creditable coverage and 
waiting period information--(1) General. The rules in this paragraph (c) 
implement section 2701(c)(4) of the PHS Act, which permits individuals 
to establish creditable coverage through means other than certificates, 
and section 2701(e)(3) of the PHS Act, which requires the Secretary to 
establish rules designed to prevent an individual's subsequent coverage 
under a group health plan or health insurance coverage from being 
adversely affected by an entity's failure to provide a certificate with 
respect to that individual. If the accuracy of a certificate is 
contested or a certificate is unavailable when needed by the individual, 
the individual has the right to demonstrate creditable coverage (and 
waiting or affiliation periods) through the presentation of documents or 
other means. For example, the individual may make such a demonstration 
when--
    (i) An entity has failed to provide a certificate within the 
required time period;
    (ii) The individual has creditable coverage but an entity may not be 
required to provide a certificate of the coverage under paragraph (a) of 
this section;
    (iii) The coverage is for a period before July 1, 1996;
    (iv) The individual has an urgent medical condition that 
necessitates a

[[Page 593]]

determination before the individual can deliver a certificate to the 
plan; or
    (v) The individual lost a certificate that the individual had 
previously received and is unable to obtain another certificate.
    (2)Evidence of creditable coverage--(i) Consideration of evidence. A 
plan or issuer is required to take into account all information that it 
obtains or that is presented on behalf of an individual to make a 
determination, based on the relevant facts and circumstances, whether an 
individual has creditable coverage and is entitled to offset all or a 
portion of any preexisting condition exclusion period. A plan or issuer 
shall treat the individual as having furnished a certificate under 
paragraph (a) of this section if the individual attests to the period of 
creditable coverage, the individual also presents relevant corroborating 
evidence of some creditable coverage during the period, and the 
individual cooperates with the plan's or issuer's efforts to verify the 
individual's coverage. For this purpose, cooperation includes providing 
(upon the plan's or issuer's request) a written authorization for the 
plan or issuer to request a certificate on behalf of the individual, and 
cooperating in efforts to determine the validity of the corroborating 
evidence and the dates of creditable coverage. While a plan or issuer 
may refuse to credit coverage where the individual fails to cooperate 
with the plan's or issuer's efforts to verify coverage, the plan or 
issuer may not consider an individual's inability to obtain a 
certificate to be evidence of the absence of creditable coverage.
    (ii) Documents. Documents that may establish creditable coverage 
(and waiting periods or affiliation periods) in the absence of a 
certificate include explanations of benefit claims (EOBs) or other 
correspondence from a plan or issuer indicating coverage, pay stubs 
showing a payroll deduction for health coverage, a health insurance 
identification card, a certificate of coverage under a group health 
policy, records from medical care providers indicating health coverage, 
third party statements verifying periods of coverage, and any other 
relevant documents that evidence periods of health coverage.
    (iii) Other evidence. Creditable coverage (and waiting period or 
affiliation period information) may also be established through means 
other than documentation, such as by a telephone call from the plan or 
provider to a third party verifying creditable coverage.
    (iv) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (c)(2):

    Example: (i) Individual F terminates employment with Employer W and, 
a month later, is hired by Employer X. Employer X's group health plan 
imposes a preexisting condition exclusion of 12 months on new enrollees 
under the plan and uses the standard method of determining creditable 
coverage. F fails to receive a certificate of prior coverage from the 
self-insured group health plan maintained by F's prior employer, 
Employer W, and requests a certificate. However, F (and Employer X's 
plan, on F's behalf) is unable to obtain a certificate from Employer W's 
plan. F attests that, to the best of F's knowledge, F had at least 12 
months of continuous coverage under Employer W's plan, and that the 
coverage ended no earlier than F's termination of employment from 
Employer W. In addition, F presents evidence of coverage, such as an 
explanation of benefits for a claim that was made during the relevant 
period.
    (ii) In this Example, based solely on these facts, F has 
demonstrated creditable coverage for the 12 months of coverage under 
Employer W's plan in the same manner as if F had presented a written 
certificate of creditable coverage.

    (3) Demonstrating categories of creditable coverage. Procedures 
similar to those described in this paragraph (c) apply in order to 
determine an individual's creditable coverage with respect to any 
category under paragraph (b) of this section (relating to determining 
creditable coverage under the alternative method).
    (4) Demonstrating dependent status. If, in the course of providing 
evidence (including a certificate) of creditable coverage, an individual 
is required to demonstrate dependent status, the group health plan or 
issuer is required to treat the individual as having furnished a 
certificate showing the dependent status if the individual attests to 
such dependency and the period of such status and the individual 
cooperates with the plan's or issuer's efforts to verify the dependent 
status.

[[Page 594]]

    (d) Determination and notification of creditable coverage--(1) 
Reasonable time period. In the event that a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage receives 
information in this section under paragraph (a) (certifications), 
paragraph (b) (disclosure of information relating to the alternative 
method), or paragraph (c) (other evidence of creditable coverage), the 
entity is required, within a reasonable time period following receipt of 
the information, to make a determination regarding the individual's 
period of creditable coverage and notify the individual of the 
determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 
Whether a determination and notification regarding an individual's 
creditable coverage is made within a reasonable time period is 
determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Relevant facts 
and circumstances include whether a plan's application of a preexisting 
condition exclusion would prevent an individual from having access to 
urgent medical services.
    (2) Notification to individual of period of preexisting condition 
exclusion. A plan r issuer seeking to impose a preexisting condition 
exclusion is required to disclose to the individual, in writing, its 
determination of any preexisting condition exclusion period that applies 
to the individual, and the basis for such determination, including the 
source and substance of any information on which the plan or issuer 
relied. In addition, the plan or issuer is required to provide the 
individual with a written explanation of any appeal procedures 
established by the plan or issuer, and with a reasonable opportunity to 
submit additional evidence of creditable coverage. However, nothing in 
this paragraph (d) or paragraph (c) of this section prevents a plan or 
issuer from modifying an initial determination of creditable coverage if 
it determines that the individual did not have the claimed creditable 
coverage, provided that--
    (i) A notice of the reconsideration is provided to the individual; 
and
    (ii) Until the final determination is made, the plan or issuer, for 
purposes of approving access to medical services (such as a pre-surgery 
authorization), acts in a manner consistent with the initial 
determination.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d):

    Example 1: (i) Individual F terminates employment with Employer W 
and, a month later, is hired by Employer X. Example 1: Individual G is 
hired by Employer Y. Employer Y's group health plan imposes a 
preexisting condition exclusion for 12 months with respect to new 
enrollees and uses the standard method of determining creditable 
coverage. Employer Y's plan determines that G is subject to a 4-month 
preexisting condition exclusion, based on a certificate of creditable 
coverage that is provided by G to Employer Y's plan indicating 8 months 
of coverage under G's prior group health plan.
    (ii) In this Example, Employer Y's plan must notify G within a 
reasonable period of time following receipt of the certificate that G is 
subject to a 4-month preexisting condition exclusion beginning on G's 
enrollment date in Y's plan.
    Example 2: (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employer Y's 
plan determines that G has 14 months of creditable coverage based on G's 
certificate indicating 14 months of creditable coverage under G's prior 
plan.
    (ii) In this Example, Employer Y's plan is not required to notify G 
that G will not be subject to a preexisting condition exclusion.
    Example 3: (i) Individual H is hired by Employer Z. Employer Z's 
group health plan imposes a preexisting condition exclusion for 12 
months with respect to new enrollees and uses the standard method of 
determining creditable coverage. H develops an urgent health condition 
before receiving a certificate of prior coverage. H attests to the 
period of prior coverage, presents corroborating documentation of the 
coverage period, and authorizes the plan to request a certificate on H's 
behalf.
    (ii) In this Example, Employer Z's plan must review the evidence 
presented by H. In addition, the plan must make a determination and 
notify H regarding any preexisting condition exclusion period that 
applies to H (and the basis of such determination) within a reasonable 
time period following receipt of the evidence that is consistent with 
the urgency of H's health condition, (This determination may be modified 
as permitted under paragraph (d)(2)).

Sec. 146.117  Special enrollment periods.

    (a) Special enrollment for certain individuals who lose coverage--
(1) General. A

[[Page 595]]

group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health 
insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, is required 
to permit employees and dependents described in this section in 
paragraph (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) to enroll for coverage under the 
terms of the plan if the conditions in paragraph (a)(5) are satisfied 
and the enrollment is requested within the period described in paragraph 
(a)(6). The enrollment is effective at the time described in paragraph 
(a)(7). The special enrollment rights under this paragraph (a) apply 
without regard to the dates on which an individual would otherwise be 
able to enroll under the plan.
    (2) Special enrollment of an employee only. An employee is described 
in this paragraph (a)(2) if the employee is eligible, but not enrolled, 
for coverage under the terms of the plan and, when enrollment was 
previously offered to the employee under the plan and was declined by 
the employee, the employee was covered under another group health plan 
or had other health insurance coverage.
    (3) Special enrollment of dependents only. A dependent is described 
in this paragraph (a)(3) if the dependent is a dependent of an employee 
participating in the plan, the dependent is eligible, but not enrolled, 
for coverage under the terms of the plan, and, when enrollment was 
previously offered under the plan and was declined, the dependent was 
covered under another group health plan or had other health insurance 
coverage.
    (4) Special enrollment of both employee and dependent. An employee 
and any dependent of the employee are described in this paragraph (a)(4) 
if they are eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of 
the plan and, when enrollment was previously offered to the employee or 
dependent under the plan and was declined, the employee or dependent was 
covered under another group health plan or had other health insurance 
coverage.
    (5) Conditions for special enrollment. An employee or dependent is 
eligible to enroll during a special enrollment period if each of the 
following applicable conditions is met:
    (i) When the employee declined enrollment for the employee or the 
dependent, the employee stated in writing that coverage under another 
group health plan or other health insurance coverage was the reason for 
declining enrollment. This paragraph (a)(5)(i) applies only if--
    (A) The plan required such a statement when the employee declined 
enrollment; and
    (B) The employee is provided with notice of the requirement to 
provide the statement in paragraph (a)(5)(i) (and the consequences of 
the employee's failure to provide the statement) at the time the 
employee declined enrollment.
    (ii)(A) When the employee declined enrollment for the employee or 
dependent under the plan, the employee or dependent had COBRA 
continuation coverage under another plan and COBRA continuation coverage 
under that other plan has since been exhausted; or
    (B) If the other coverage that applied to the employee or dependent 
when enrollment was declined was not under a COBRA continuation 
provision, either the other coverage has been terminated as a result of 
loss of eligibility for the coverage or employer contributions towards 
the other coverage have been terminated. For this purpose, loss of 
eligibility for coverage includes a loss of coverage as a result of 
legal separation, divorce, death, termination of employment, reduction 
in the number of hours of employment, and any loss of eligibility after 
a period that is measured by reference to any of the foregoing. Thus, 
for example, if an employee's coverage ceases following a termination of 
employment and the employee is eligible for but fails to elect COBRA 
continuation coverage, this is treated as a loss of eligibility under 
this paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(B). However, loss of eligibility does not 
include a loss due to failure of the individual or the participant to 
pay premiums on a timely basis or termination of coverage for cause 
(such as making a fraudulent claim or an intentional misrepresentation 
of a material fact in connection with the plan). In addition, for 
purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(B), employer contributions include 
contributions by any current or

[[Page 596]]

former employer (of the individual or another person) that was 
contributing to coverage for the individual.
    (6) Length of special enrollment period. The employee is required to 
request enrollment (for the employee or the employee's dependent, as 
described in this section in paragraph (a)(2), paragraph (a)(3), or 
paragraph (a)(4)) not later than 30 days after the exhaustion of the 
other coverage described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A) or termination of 
the other coverage as a result of the loss of eligibility for the other 
coverage for items described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(B) or following the 
termination of employer contributions toward that other coverage. The 
plan may impose the same requirements that apply to employees who are 
otherwise eligible under the plan to immediately request enrollment for 
coverage (for example, that the request be made in writing).
    (7) Effective date of enrollment. Enrollment is effective not later 
than the first day of the first calendar month beginning after the date 
the completed request for enrollment is received.
    (b) Special enrollment with respect to certain dependent 
beneficiaries--(1) General. A group health plan that makes coverage 
available with respect to dependents of a participant is required to 
provide a special enrollment period to permit individuals described in 
this section in paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6) to 
be enrolled for coverage under the terms of the plan if the enrollment 
is requested within the time period described in paragraph (b)(7). The 
enrollment is effective at the time described in paragraph (b)(8). The 
special enrollment rights under this paragraph (b) apply without regard 
to the dates on which an individual would otherwise be able to enroll 
under the plan.
    (2) Special enrollment of an employee who is eligible but not 
enrolled. An individual is described in this paragraph (b)(2) if the 
individual is an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for 
coverage under the terms of the plan, the individual would be a 
participant but for a prior election by the individual not to enroll in 
the plan during a previous enrollment period, and a person becomes a 
dependent of the individual through marriage, birth, or adoption or 
placement for adoption.
    (3) Special enrollment of a spouse of a participant. An individual 
is described in this paragraph (b)(3) if either--
    (i) The individual becomes the spouse of a participant; or
    (ii) The individual is a spouse of the participant and a child 
becomes a dependent of the participant through birth, adoption, or 
placement for adoption.
    (4) Special enrollment of an employee who is eligible, but not 
enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the spouse of such employee. 
An employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, in the plan, and an 
individual who is a dependent of such employee, are described in this 
paragraph (b)(4) if the employee would be a participant but for a prior 
election by the employee not to enroll in the plan during a previous 
enrollment period, and either--
    (i) The employee and the individual become married; or
    (ii) The employee and individual are married and a child becomes a 
dependent of the employee through birth, adoption or placement for 
adoption.
    (5) Special enrollment of a dependent of a participant. An 
individual is described in this paragraph (b)(5) if the individual is a 
dependent of a participant and the individual becomes a dependent of 
such participant through marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for 
adoption.
    (6) Special enrollment of an employee who is eligible but not 
enrolled and a new dependent. An employee who is eligible, but not 
enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan, and an individual 
who is a dependent of the employee, are described in this paragraph 
(b)(6) if the employee would be a participant but for a prior election 
by the employee not to enroll in the plan during a previous enrollment 
period, and the dependent becomes a dependent of the employee through 
marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption.
    (7) Length of special enrollment period. The special enrollment 
period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is a period of not less 
than 30 days and begins on the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption 
or placement for adoption (except that such period does not begin

[[Page 597]]

earlier than the date the plan makes dependent coverage generally 
available).
    (8) Effective date of enrollment. Enrollment is effective--
    (i) In the case of marriage, not later than the first day of the 
first calendar month beginning after the date the completed request for 
enrollment is received by the plan;
    (ii) In the case of a dependent's birth, the date of such birth; and
    (iii) In the case of a dependent's adoption or placement for 
adoption, the date of such adoption or placement for adoption.
    (9) Example. The following example illustrates the requirements of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example: (i) Employee A is hired on September 3, 1998 by Employer X, 
which has a group health plan in which A can elect to enroll either for 
employee-only coverage, for employee-plus-spouse coverage, or for family 
coverage, effective on the first day of any calendar quarter thereafter. 
A is married and has no children. A does not elect to join Employer X's 
plan (for employee-only coverage, employee-plus-spouse coverage, or 
family coverage) on October 1, 1998 or January 1, 1999. On February 15, 
1999, a child is placed for adoption with A and A's spouse.
    (ii) In this Example, the conditions for special enrollment of an 
employee with a new dependent under paragraph (b)(2) are satisfied, the 
conditions for special enrollment of an employee and a spouse with a new 
dependent under paragraph (b)(4) are satisfied, and the conditions for 
special enrollment of an employee and a new dependent under paragraph 
(b)(6) are satisfied. Accordingly, Employer X's plan will satisfy this 
paragraph (b) if and only if it allows A to elect, by filing the 
required forms by March 16, 1999, to enroll in Employer X's plan either 
with employee-only coverage, with employee-plus-spouse coverage, or with 
family coverage, effective as of February 15, 1999.

    (c) Notice of enrollment rights. On or before the time an employee 
is offered the opportunity to enroll in a group health plan, the plan is 
required to provide the employee with a description of the plan's 
special enrollment rules under this section. For this purpose, the plan 
may use the following model description of the special enrollment rules 
under this section:

    If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents 
(including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage, you 
may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your dependents in this 
plan, provided that you request enrollment within 30 days after your 
other coverage ends. In addition, if you have a new dependent as a 
result of marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption, you may 
be able to enroll yourself and your dependents, provided that you 
request enrollment within 30 days after the marriage, birth, adoption, 
or placement for adoption.

    (d) Special enrollment date definition. (1) General rule. A special 
enrollment date for an individual means any date in paragraph (a)(7) or 
paragraph (b)(8) of this section on which the individual has a right to 
have enrollment in a group health plan become effective under this 
section.
    (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the requirements of 
this paragraph (d):

    Example 1: (i) Employer Y maintains a group health plan that allows 
employees to enroll in the plan either (a) effective on the first day of 
employment by an election filed within three days thereafter, (b) 
effective on any subsequent January 1 by an election made during the 
preceding months of November or December, or (c) effective as of any 
special enrollment date described in this section. Employee B is hired 
by Employer Y on March 15, 1998 and does not elect to enroll in Employer 
Y's plan until January 31, 1999 when B loses coverage under another 
plan. B elects to enroll in Employer Y's plan effective on February 1, 
1999 by filing the completed request form by January 31, 1999, in 
accordance with the special rule set forth in paragraph (a).
    (ii) In this Example, B has enrolled on a special enrollment date 
because the enrollment is effective at a date described in paragraph 
(a)(7).
    Example 2: (i) Same facts as Example 1, except that B's loss of 
coverage under the other plan occurs on December 31, 1998 and B elects 
to enroll in Employer Y's plan effective on January 1, 1999 by filing 
the completed request form by December 31, 1998, in accordance with the 
special rule set forth in paragraph (a).
    (ii) In this Example, B has enrolled on a special enrollment date 
because the enrollment is effective at a date described in paragraph 
(a)(7) (even though this date is also a regular enrollment date under 
the plan).

<R05>
Sec. 146.119  HMO affiliation period as alternative to preexisting condition 
exclusion.

    (a) General. A group health plan offering health insurance coverage 
through an HMO, or an HMO that offers health insurance coverage in 
connection with a group health plan, may impose an affiliation period 
only if each of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section is 
satisfied.
    (b) Requirements for affiliation period. (1) No preexisting 
condition exclusion is imposed with respect to any coverage offered by 
the HMO in connection with the particular group health plan.
    (2) No premium is charged to a participant or beneficiary for the 
affiliation period.
    (3) The affiliation period for the HMO coverage is applied uniformly 
without regard to any health status-related factors.
    (4) The affiliation period does not exceed 2 months (or 3 months in 
the case of a late enrollee).
    (5) The affiliation period begins on the enrollment date.
    (6) The affiliation period for enrollment in the HMO under a plan 
runs concurrently with any waiting period.
    (c) Alternatives to affiliation period. An HMO may use alternative 
methods in lieu of an affiliation period to address adverse selection, 
as approved by the State insurance commissioner or other official 
designated to regulate HMOs. Nothing in this section requires a State to 
receive proposals for or approve alternatives to affiliation periods.


<R05>
Sec. 146.121  Prohibiting discrimination against participants and beneficiaries 
based on a health factor.

    (a) Health factors. (1) The term health factor means, in relation to 
an individual, any of the following health status-related factors:
    (i) Health status;
    (ii) Medical condition (including both physical and mental 
illnesses), as defined in Sec. 144.103;
    (iii) Claims experience;
    (iv) Receipt of health care;
    (v) Medical history;
    (vi) Genetic information, as defined in 45 CFR 144.103;
    (vii) Evidence of insurability; or
    (viii) Disability.
    (2) Evidence of insurability includes--
    (i) Conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence; and
    (ii) Participation in activities such as motorcycling, snowmobiling, 
all-terrain vehicle riding, horseback riding, skiing, and other similar 
activities.
    (3) The decision whether health coverage is elected for an 
individual (including the time chosen to enroll, such as under special 
enrollment or late enrollment) is not, itself, within the scope of any 
health factor. (However, under Sec. 146.117, a plan or issuer must treat 
special enrollees the same as similarly situated individuals who are 
enrolled when first eligible.)
    (b) Prohibited discrimination in rules for eligibility--(1) In 
general--(i) A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering 
health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may 
not establish any rule for eligibility (including continued eligibility) 
of any individual to enroll for benefits under the terms of the plan or 
group health insurance coverage that discriminates based on any health 
factor that relates to that individual or a dependent of that 
individual. This rule is subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section (explaining how this rule applies to benefits), 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section (allowing plans to impose certain 
preexisting condition exclusions), paragraph (d) of this section 
(containing rules for establishing groups of similarly situated 
individuals), paragraph (e) of this section (relating to nonconfinement, 
actively-at-work, and other service requirements), paragraph (f) of this 
section (relating to bona fide wellness programs), and paragraph (g) of 
this section (permitting favorable treatment of individuals with adverse 
health factors).
    (ii) For purposes of this section, rules for eligibility include, 
but are not limited to, rules relating to--
    (A) Enrollment;
    (B) The effective date of coverage;
    (C) Waiting (or affiliation) periods;
    (D) Late and special enrollment;
    (E) Eligibility for benefit packages (including rules for 
individuals to

[[Page 599]]

change their selection among benefit packages);
    (F) Benefits (including rules relating to covered benefits, benefit 
restrictions, and cost-sharing mechanisms such as coinsurance, 
copayments, and deductibles), as described in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) 
of this section;
    (G) Continued eligibility; and
    (H) Terminating coverage (including disenrollment) of any individual 
under the plan.
    (iii) The rules of this paragraph (b)(1) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that 
is available to all employees who enroll within the first 30 days of 
their employment. However, employees who do not enroll within the first 
30 days cannot enroll later unless they pass a physical examination.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the requirement to pass a 
physical examination in order to enroll in the plan is a rule for 
eligibility that discriminates based on one or more health factors and 
thus violates this paragraph (b)(1).
    Example 2. (i) Facts. Under an employer's group health plan, 
employees who enroll during the first 30 days of employment (and during 
special enrollment periods) may choose between two benefit packages: an 
indemnity option and an HMO option. However, employees who enroll during 
late enrollment are permitted to enroll only in the HMO option and only 
if they provide evidence of good health.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the requirement to provide 
evidence of good health in order to be eligible for late enrollment in 
the HMO option is a rule for eligibility that discriminates based on one 
or more health factors and thus violates this paragraph (b)(1). However, 
if the plan did not require evidence of good health but limited late 
enrollees to the HMO option, the plan's rules for eligibility would not 
discriminate based on any health factor, and thus would not violate this 
paragraph (b)(1), because the time an individual chooses to enroll is 
not, itself, within the scope of any health factor.
    Example 3. (i) Facts. Under an employer's group health plan, all 
employees generally may enroll within the first 30 days of employment. 
However, individuals who participate in certain recreational activities, 
including motorcycling, are excluded from coverage.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 3, excluding from the plan 
individuals who participate in recreational activities, such as 
motorcycling, is a rule for eligibility that discriminates based on one 
more health factors and thus violates this paragraph (b)(1).
    Example 4. (i) Facts. A group health plan applies for a group health 
policy offered by an issuer. As part of the application, the issuer 
receives health information about individuals to be covered under the 
plan. Individual A is an employee of the employer maintaining the plan. 
A and A's dependents have a history of high health claims. Based on the 
information about A and A's dependents, the issuer excludes A and A's 
dependents from the group policy it offers to the employer.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 4, the issuer's exclusion of A and 
A's dependents from coverage is a rule for eligibility that 
discriminates based on one or more health factors, and thus violates 
this paragraph (b)(1). (If the employer is a small employer under 45 CFR 
144.103 (generally, an employer with 50 or fewer employees), the issuer 
also may violate 45 CFR 146.150, which requires issuers to offer all the 
policies they sell in the small group market on a guaranteed available 
basis to all small employers and to accept every eligible individual in 
every small employer group.) If the plan provides coverage through this 
policy and does not provide equivalent coverage for A and A's dependents 
through other means, the plan will also violate this paragraph (b)(1).

    (2) Application to benefits--(i) General rule. (A) Under this 
section, a group health plan or group health insurance issuer is not 
required to provide coverage for any particular benefit to any group of 
similarly situated individuals.
    (B) However, benefits provided under a plan or through group health 
insurance coverage must be uniformly available to all similarly situated 
individuals (as described in paragraph (d) of this section). Likewise, 
any restriction on a benefit or benefits must apply uniformly to all 
similarly situated individuals and must not be directed at individual 
participants or beneficiaries based on any health factor of the 
participants or beneficiaries (determined based on all the relevant 
facts and circumstances). Thus, for example, a plan or issuer may limit 
or exclude benefits in relation to a specific disease or condition, 
limit or exclude benefits for certain types of treatments or drugs, or 
limit or exclude benefits based on a determination of whether the 
benefits are experimental or not medically necessary, but only if the 
benefit limitation or exclusion applies uniformly to all similarly 
situated individuals and is

[[Page 600]]

not directed at individual participants or beneficiaries based on any 
health factor of the participants or beneficiaries. In addition, a plan 
or issuer may impose annual, lifetime, or other limits on benefits and 
may require the satisfaction of a deductible, copayment, coinsurance, or 
other cost-sharing requirement in order to obtain a benefit if the limit 
or cost-sharing requirement applies uniformly to all similarly situated 
individuals and is not directed at individual participants or 
beneficiaries based on any health factor of the participants or 
beneficiaries. In the case of a cost-sharing requirement, see also 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, which permits variances in the 
application of a cost-sharing mechanism made available under a bona fide 
wellness program. (Whether any plan provision or practice with respect 
to benefits complies with this paragraph (b)(2)(i) does not affect 
whether the provision or practice is permitted under any other provision 
of ERISA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, or any other law, whether 
State or federal.)
    (C) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), a plan amendment 
applicable to all individuals in one or more groups of similarly 
situated individuals under the plan and made effective no earlier than 
the first day of the first plan year after the amendment is adopted is 
not considered to be directed at any individual participants or 
beneficiaries.
    (D) The rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. A group health plan applies a $500,000 
lifetime limit on all benefits to each participant or beneficiary 
covered under the plan. The limit is not directed at individual 
participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the limit does not violate this 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) because $500,000 of benefits are available uniformly 
to each participant and beneficiary under the plan and because the limit 
is applied uniformly to all participants and beneficiaries and is not 
directed at individual participants or beneficiaries.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. A group health plan has a $2 million lifetime 
limit on all benefits (and no other lifetime limits) for participants 
covered under the plan. Participant B files a claim for the treatment of 
AIDS. At the next corporate board meeting of the plan sponsor, the claim 
is discussed. Shortly thereafter, the plan is modified to impose a 
$10,000 lifetime limit on benefits for the treatment of AIDS, effective 
before the beginning of the next plan year.
    (ii) Conclusion. Under the facts of this Example 2, the plan 
violates this paragraph (b)(2)(i) because the plan modification is 
directed at B based on B's claim.
    Example 3. (i) A group health plan applies for a group health policy 
offered by an issuer. Individual C is covered under the plan and has an 
adverse health condition. As part of the application, the issuer 
receives health information about the individuals to be covered, 
including information about C's adverse health condition. The policy 
form offered by the issuer generally provides benefits for the adverse 
health condition that C has, but in this case the issuer offers the plan 
a policy modified by a rider that excludes benefits for C for that 
condition. The exclusionary rider is made effective the first day of the 
next plan year.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 3, the issuer violates this 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) because benefits for C's condition are available to 
other individuals in the group of similarly situated individuals that 
includes C but are not available to C. Thus, the benefits are not 
uniformly available to all similarly situated individuals. Even though 
the exclusionary rider is made effective the first day of the next plan 
year, because the rider does not apply to all similarly situated 
individuals, the issuer violates this paragraph (b)(2)(i).
    Example 4. (i) Facts. A group health plan has a $2,000 lifetime 
limit for the treatment of temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ). The 
limit is applied uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and is 
not directed at individual participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 4, the limit does not violate this 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) because $2,000 of benefits for the treatment of TMJ 
are available uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and a plan 
may limit benefits covered in relation to a specific disease or 
condition if the limit applies uniformly to all similarly situated 
individuals and is not directed at individual participants or 
beneficiaries.
    Example 5. (i) Facts. A group health plan applies a $2 million 
lifetime limit on all benefits. However, the $2 million lifetime limit 
is reduced to $10,000 for any participant or beneficiary covered under 
the plan who has a congenital heart defect.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 5, the lower lifetime limit for 
participants and beneficiaries with a congenital heart defect violates 
this paragraph (b)(2)(i) because benefits under the plan are not 
uniformly available to all similarly situated individuals and the plan's 
lifetime limit on benefits does not apply uniformly to all similarly 
situated individuals.

[[Page 601]]

    Example 6. (i) Facts. A group health plan limits benefits for 
prescription drugs to those listed on a drug formulary. The limit is 
applied uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and is not 
directed at individual participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 6, the exclusion from coverage of 
drugs not listed on the drug formulary does not violate this paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) because benefits for prescription drugs listed on the 
formulary are uniformly available to all similarly situated individuals 
and because the exclusion of drugs not listed on the formulary applies 
uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and is not directed at 
individual participants or beneficiaries.
    Example 7. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, doctor visits are 
generally subject to a $250 annual deductible and 20 percent coinsurance 
requirement. However, prenatal doctor visits are not subject to any 
deductible or coinsurance requirement. These rules are applied uniformly 
to all similarly situated individuals and are not directed at individual 
participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 7, imposing different deductible 
and coinsurance requirements for prenatal doctor visits and other visits 
does not violate this paragraph (b)(2)(i) because a plan may establish 
different deductibles or coinsurance requirements for different services 
if the deductible or coinsurance requirement is applied uniformly to all 
similarly situated individuals and is not directed at individual 
participants or beneficiaries.

    (ii) Cost-sharing mechanisms and wellness programs. A group health 
plan or group health insurance coverage with a cost-sharing mechanism 
(such as a deductible, copayment, or coinsurance) that requires a higher 
payment from an individual, based on a health factor of that individual 
or a dependent of that individual, than for a similarly situated 
individual under the plan (and thus does not apply uniformly to all 
similarly situated individuals) does not violate the requirements of 
this paragraph (b)(2) if the payment differential is based on whether an 
individual has complied with the requirements of a bona fide wellness 
program.
    (iii) Specific rule relating to source-of-injury exclusions. (A) If 
a group health plan or group health insurance coverage generally 
provides benefits for a type of injury, the plan or issuer may not deny 
benefits otherwise provided for treatment of the injury if the injury 
results from an act of domestic violence or a medical condition 
(including both physical and mental health conditions).
    (B) The rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. A group health plan generally provides 
medical/surgical benefits, including benefits for hospital stays, that 
are medically necessary. However, the plan excludes benefits for self-
inflicted injuries or injuries sustained in connection with attempted 
suicide. Individual D suffers from depression and attempts suicide. As a 
result, D sustains injuries and is hospitalized for treatment of the 
injuries. Pursuant to the exclusion, the plan denies D benefits for 
treatment of the injuries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the suicide attempt is the 
result of a medical condition (depression). Accordingly, the denial of 
benefits for the treatments of D's injuries violates the requirements of 
this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) because the plan provision excludes benefits 
for treatment of an injury resulting from a medical condition.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. A group health plan provides benefits for head 
injuries generally. The plan also has a general exclusion for any injury 
sustained while participating in any of a number of recreational 
activities, including bungee jumping. However, this exclusion does not 
apply to any injury that results from a medical condition (nor from 
domestic violence). Participant E sustains a head injury while bungee 
jumping. The injury did not result from a medical condition (nor from 
domestic violence). Accordingly, the plan denies benefits for E 's head 
injury.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan provision that denies 
benefits based on the source of an injury does not restrict benefits 
based on an act of domestic violence or any medical condition. 
Therefore, the provision is permissible under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) 
and does not violate this section. (However, if the plan did not allow E 
to enroll in the plan (or applied different rules for eligibility to E) 
because E frequently participates in bungee jumping, the plan would 
violate paragraph (b)(1) of this section.)

    (3) Relationship to Sec. 146.111. (i) A preexisting condition 
exclusion is permitted under this section if it--
    (A) Complies with Sec. 146.111;
    (B) Applies uniformly to all similarly situated individuals (as 
described in paragraph (d) of this section); and
    (C) Is not directed at individual participants or beneficiaries 
based on any health factor of the participants or

[[Page 602]]

beneficiaries. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C), a plan 
amendment relating to a preexisting condition exclusion applicable to 
all individuals in one or more groups of similarly situated individuals 
under the plan and made effective no earlier than the first day of the 
first plan year after the amendment is adopted is not considered to be 
directed at any individual participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) The rules of this paragraph (b)(3) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. A group health plan imposes a preexisting 
condition exclusion on all individuals enrolled in the plan. The 
exclusion applies to conditions for which medical advice, diagnosis, 
care, or treatment was recommended or received within the six-month 
period ending on an individual's enrollment date. In addition, the 
exclusion generally extends for 12 months after an individual's 
enrollment date, but this 12-month period is offset by the number of 
days of an individual's creditable coverage in accordance with Sec. 
146.111. There is nothing to indicate that the exclusion is directed at 
individual participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, even though the plan's 
preexisting condition exclusion discriminates against individuals based 
on one or more health factors, the preexisting condition exclusion does 
not violate this section because it applies uniformly to all similarly 
situated individuals, is not directed at individual participants or 
beneficiaries, and complies with Sec. 146.111 (that is, the requirements 
relating to the six-month look-back period, the 12-month (or 18-month) 
maximum exclusion period, and the creditable coverage offset).
    Example 2. (i) Facts. A group health plan excludes coverage for 
conditions with respect to which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or 
treatment was recommended or received within the six-month period ending 
on an individual's enrollment date. Under the plan, the preexisting 
condition exclusion generally extends for 12 months, offset by 
creditable coverage. However, if an individual has no claims in the 
first six months following enrollment, the remainder of the exclusion 
period is waived.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan's preexisting condition 
exclusions violate this section because they do not meet the 
requirements of this paragraph (b)(3); specifically, they do not apply 
uniformly to all similarly situated individuals. The plan provisions do 
not apply uniformly to all similarly situated individuals because 
individuals who have medical claims during the first six months 
following enrollment are not treated the same as similarly situated 
individuals with no claims during that period. (Under paragraph (d) of 
this section, the groups cannot be treated as two separate groups of 
similarly situated individuals because the distinction is based on a 
health factor.)

    (c) Prohibited discrimination in premiums or contributions--(1) In 
general. (i) A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering 
health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may 
not require an individual, as a condition of enrollment or continued 
enrollment under the plan or group health insurance coverage, to pay a 
premium or contribution that is greater than the premium or contribution 
for a similarly situated individual (described in paragraph (d) of this 
section) enrolled in the plan or group health insurance coverage based 
on any health factor that relates to the individual or a dependent of 
the individual.
    (ii) Discounts, rebates, payments in kind, and any other premium 
differential mechanisms are taken into account in determining an 
individual's premium or contribution rate. (For rules relating to cost-
sharing mechanisms, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section (addressing 
benefits).)
    (2) Rules relating to premium rates--(i) Group rating based on 
health factors not restricted under this section. Nothing in this 
section restricts the aggregate amount that an employer may be charged 
for coverage under a group health plan.
    (ii) List billing based on a health factor prohibited. However, a 
group health insurance issuer, or a group health plan, may not quote or 
charge an employer (or an individual) a different premium for an 
individual in a group of similarly situated individuals based on a 
health factor. (But see paragraph (g) of this section permitting 
favorable treatment of individuals with adverse health factors.)
    (iii) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c)(2) are illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan and 
purchases coverage from a health insurance issuer. In order to determine 
the premium rate for the upcoming plan year, the issuer reviews the 
claims experience of individuals covered under the

[[Page 603]]

plan. The issuer finds that Individual F had significantly higher claims 
experience than similarly situated individuals in the plan. The issuer 
quotes the plan a higher per-participant rate because of F 's claims 
experience.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the issuer does not violate the 
provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) because the issuer blends the rate 
so that the employer is not quoted a higher rate for F than for a 
similarly situated individual based on F 's claims experience.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. Same facts as Example 1, except that the 
issuer quotes the employer a higher premium rate for F, because of F 's 
claims experience, than for a similarly situated individual.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the issuer violates this 
paragraph (c)(2). Moreover, even if the plan purchased the policy based 
on the quote but did not require a higher participant contribution for F 
than for a similarly situated individual, the issuer would still violate 
this paragraph (c)(2) (but in such a case the plan would not violate 
this paragraph (c)(2)).

    (3) Exception for bona fide wellness programs. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, a plan may establish a 
premium or contribution differential based on whether an individual has 
complied with the requirements of a bona fide wellness program.
    (d) Similarly situated individuals. The requirements of this section 
apply only within a group of individuals who are treated as similarly 
situated individuals. A plan or issuer may treat participants as a group 
of similarly situated individuals separate from beneficiaries. In 
addition, participants may be treated as two or more distinct groups of 
similarly situated individuals and beneficiaries may be treated as two 
or more distinct groups of similarly situated individuals in accordance 
with the rules of this paragraph (d). Moreover, if individuals have a 
choice of two or more benefit packages, individuals choosing one benefit 
package may be treated as one or more groups of similarly situated 
individuals distinct from individuals choosing another benefit package.
    (1) Participants. Subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a 
plan or issuer may treat participants as two or more distinct groups of 
similarly situated individuals if the distinction between or among the 
groups of participants is based on a bona fide employment-based 
classification consistent with the employer's usual business practice. 
Whether an employment-based classification is bona fide is determined on 
the basis of all the relevant facts and circumstances. Relevant facts 
and circumstances include whether the employer uses the classification 
for purposes independent of qualification for health coverage (for 
example, determining eligibility for other employee benefits or 
determining other terms of employment). Subject to paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section, examples of classifications that, based on all the 
relevant facts and circumstances, may be bona fide include full-time 
versus part-time status, different geographic location, membership in a 
collective bargaining unit, date of hire, length of service, current 
employee versus former employee status, and different occupations. 
However, a classification based on any health factor is not a bona fide 
employment-based classification, unless the requirements of paragraph 
(g) of this section are satisfied (permitting favorable treatment of 
individuals with adverse health factors).
    (2) Beneficiaries--(i) Subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, 
a plan or issuer may treat beneficiaries as two or more distinct groups 
of similarly situated individuals if the distinction between or among 
the groups of beneficiaries is based on any of the following factors:
    (A) A bona fide employment-based classification of the participant 
through whom the beneficiary is receiving coverage;
    (B) Relationship to the participant (e.g., as a spouse or as a 
dependent child);
    (C) Marital status;
    (D) With respect to children of a participant, age or student 
status; or
    (E) Any other factor if the factor is not a health factor.
    (ii) Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not prevent more 
favorable treatment of individuals with adverse health factors in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) Discrimination directed at individuals. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, if the creation or 
modification of an employment or coverage classification is directed at

[[Page 604]]

individual participants or beneficiaries based on any health factor of 
the participants or beneficiaries, the classification is not permitted 
under this paragraph (d), unless it is permitted under paragraph (g) of 
this section (permitting favorable treatment of individuals with adverse 
health factors). Thus, if an employer modified an employment-based 
classification to single out, based on a health factor, individual 
participants and beneficiaries and deny them health coverage, the new 
classification would not be permitted under this section.
    (4) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan for 
full-time employees only. Under the plan (consistent with the employer's 
ususal business practice), employees who normally work at least 30 hours 
per week are considered to be working full-time. Other employees are 
considered to be working part-time. There is no evidence to suggest that 
the classification is directed at individual participants or 
beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, treating the full-time and part-
time employees as two separate groups of similarly situated individuals 
is permitted under this paragraph (d) because the classification is bona 
fide and is not directed at individual participants or beneficiaries.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, coverage is made 
available to employees, their spouses, and their dependent children. 
However, coverage is made available to a dependent child only if the 
dependent child is under age 19 (or under age 25 if the child is 
continuously enrolled full-time in an institution of higher learning 
(full-time students)). There is no evidence to suggest that these 
classifications are directed at individual participants or 
beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, treating spouses and dependent 
children differently by imposing an age limitation on dependent 
children, but not on spouses, is permitted under this paragraph (d). 
Specifically, the distinction between spouses and dependent children is 
permitted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and is not prohibited 
under paragraph (d)(3) of this section because it is not directed at 
individual participants or beneficiaries. It is also permissible to 
treat dependent children who are under age 19 (or full-time students 
under age 25) as a group of similarly situated individuals separate from 
those who are age 25 or older (or age 19 or older if they are not full-
time students) because the classification is permitted under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section and is not directed at individual participants or 
beneficiaries.
    Example 3. (i) Facts. A university sponsors a group health plan that 
provides one health benefit package to faculty and another health 
benefit package to other staff. Faculty and staff are treated 
differently with respect to other employee benefits such as retirement 
benefits and leaves of absence. There is no evidence to suggest that the 
distinction is directed at individual participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 3, the classification is permitted 
under this paragraph (d) because there is a distinction based on a bona 
fide employment-based classification consistent with the employer's 
usual business practice and the distinction is not directed at 
individual participants and beneficiaries.
    Example 4. (i) Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that 
is available to all current employees. Former employees may also be 
eligible, but only if they complete a specified number of years of 
service, are enrolled under the plan at the time of termination of 
employment, and are continuously enrolled from that date. There is no 
evidence to suggest that these distinctions are directed at individual 
participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 4, imposing additional eligibility 
requirements on former employees is permitted because a classification 
that distinguishes between current and former employees is a bona fide 
employment-based classification that is permitted under this paragraph 
(d), provided that it is not directed at individual participants or 
beneficiaries. In addition, it is permissible to distinguish between 
former employees who satisfy the service requirement and those who do 
not, provided that the distinction is not directed at individual 
participants or beneficiaries. (However, former employees who do not 
satisfy the eligibility criteria may, nonetheless, be eligible for 
continued coverage pursuant to a COBRA continuation provision or similar 
State law.)
    Example 5. (i) Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that 
provides the same benefit package to all seven employees of the 
employer. Six of the seven employees have the same job title and 
responsibilities, but Employee G has a different job title and different 
responsibilities. After G files an expensive claim for benefits under 
the plan, coverage under the plan is modified so that employees with G's 
job title receive a different benefit package that includes a lower 
lifetime dollar limit than in the benefit package made available to the 
other six employees.
    (ii) Conclusion. Under the facts of this Example 5, changing the 
coverage classification for G based on the existing employment 
classification for G is not permitted under this

[[Page 605]]

paragraph (d) because the creation of the new coverage classification 
for G is directed at G based on one or more health factors.

    (e) Nonconfinement and actively-at-work provisions--(1) 
Nonconfinement provisions--(i) General rule. Under the rules of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a plan or issuer may not 
establish a rule for eligibility (as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section) or set any individual's premium or contribution rate 
based on whether an individual is confined to a hospital or other health 
care institution. In addition, under the rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section, a plan or issuer may not establish a rule for 
eligibility or set any individual's premium or contribution rate based 
on an individual's ability to engage in normal life activities, except 
to the extent permitted under paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (3) of this 
section (permitting plans and issuers, under certain circumstances, to 
distinguish among employees based on the performance of services).
    (ii) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (e)(1) are illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, coverage for 
employees and their dependents generally becomes effective on the first 
day of employment. However, coverage for a dependent who is confined to 
a hospital or other health care institution does not become effective 
until the confinement ends.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan violates this paragraph 
(e)(1) because the plan delays the effective date of coverage for 
dependents based on confinement to a hospital or other health care 
institution.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. In previous years, a group health plan has 
provided coverage through a group health insurance policy offered by 
Issuer M. However, for the current year, the plan provides coverage 
through a group health insurance policy offered by Issuer N. Under 
Issuer N's policy, items and services provided in connection with the 
confinement of a dependent to a hospital or other health care 
institution are not covered if the confinement is covered under an 
extension of benefits clause from a previous health insurance issuer.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, Issuer N violates this paragraph 
(e)(1) because the group health insurance coverage restricts benefits (a 
rule for eligibility under paragraph (b)(1)) based on whether a 
dependent is confined to a hospital or other health care institution 
that is covered under an extension of benefits clause from a previous 
issuer. This section does not affect any obligation Issuer M may have 
under applicable State law to provide any extension of benefits and does 
not affect any State law governing coordination of benefits.

    (2) Actively-at-work and continuous service provisions--(i) General 
rule--(A) Under the rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and 
subject to the exception for the first day of work described in 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, a plan or issuer may not establish 
a rule for eligibility (as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section) or set any individual's premium or contribution rate based on 
whether an individual is actively at work (including whether an 
individual is continuously employed), unless absence from work due to 
any health factor (such as being absent from work on sick leave) is 
treated, for purposes of the plan or health insurance coverage, as being 
actively at work.
    (B) The rules of this paragraph (e)(2)(i) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, an employee 
generally becomes eligible to enroll 30 days after the first day of 
employment. However, if the employee is not actively at work on the 
first day after the end of the 30-day period, then eligibility for 
enrollment is delayed until the first day the employee is actively at 
work.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan violates this paragraph 
(e)(2) (and thus also violates paragraph (b) of this section). However, 
the plan would not violate paragraph (e)(2) or (b) of this section if, 
under the plan, an absence due to any health factor is considered being 
actively at work.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, coverage for an 
employee becomes effective after 90 days of continuous service; that is, 
if an employee is absent from work (for any reason) before completing 90 
days of service, the beginning of the 90-day period is measured from the 
day the employee returns to work (without any credit for service before 
the absence).
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan violates this paragraph 
(e)(2) (and thus also paragraph (b) of this section) because the 90-day 
continuous service requirement is a rule for eligibility based on 
whether an individual is actively at work. However, the plan would not 
violate this paragraph (e)(2) or paragraph (b) of this section if, under 
the plan, an absence due to any health factor is not considered an 
absence for purposes of measuring 90 days of continuous service.


[[Page 606]]


    (ii) Exception for the first day of work--(A) Notwithstanding the 
general rule in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, a plan or issuer 
may establish a rule for eligibility that requires an individual to 
begin work for the employer sponsoring the plan (or, in the case of a 
multiemployer plan, to begin a job in covered employment) before 
coverage becomes effective, provided that such a rule for eligibility 
applies regardless of the reason for the absence.
    (B) The rules of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. Under the eligibility provision of a group 
health plan, coverage for new employees becomes effective on the first 
day that the employee reports to work. Individual H is scheduled to 
begin work on August 3. However, H is unable to begin work on that day 
because of illness. H begins working on August 4, and H's coverage is 
effective on August 4.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan provision does not 
violate this section. However, if coverage for individuals who do not 
report to work on the first day they were scheduled to work for a reason 
unrelated to a health factor (such as vacation or bereavement) becomes 
effective on the first day they were scheduled to work, then the plan 
would violate this section.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, coverage for new 
employees becomes effective on the first day of the month following the 
employee's first day of work, regardless of whether the employee is 
actively at work on the first day of the month. Individual J is 
scheduled to begin work on March 24. However, J is unable to begin work 
on March 24 because of illness. J begins working on April 7 and J's 
coverage is effective May 1.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan provision does not 
violate this section. However, as in Example 1, if coverage for 
individuals absent from work for reasons unrelated to a health factor 
became effective despite their absence, then the plan would violate this 
section.

    (3) Relationship to plan provisions defining similarly situated 
individuals--(i) Notwithstanding the rules of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) 
of this section, a plan or issuer may establish rules for eligibility or 
set any individual's premium or contribution rate in accordance with the 
rules relating to similarly situated individuals in paragraph (d) of 
this section. Accordingly, a plan or issuer may distinguish in rules for 
eligibility under the plan between full-time and part-time employees, 
between permanent and temporary or seasonal employees, between current 
and former employees, and between employees currently performing 
services and employees no longer performing services for the employer, 
subject to paragraph (d) of this section. However, other federal or 
State laws (including the COBRA continuation provisions and the Family 
and Medical Leave Act of 1993) may require an employee or the employee's 
dependents to be offered coverage and set limits on the premium or 
contribution rate even though the employee is not performing services.
    (ii) The rules of this paragraph (e)(3) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, employees are 
eligible for coverage if they perform services for the employer for 30 
or more hours per week or if they are on paid leave (such as vacation, 
sick, or bereavement leave). Employees on unpaid leave are treated as a 
separate group of similarly situated individuals in accordance with the 
rules of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan provisions do not 
violate this section. However, if the plan treated individuals 
performing services for the employer for 30 or more hours per week, 
individuals on vacation leave, and individuals on bereavement leave as a 
group of similarly situated individuals separate from individuals on 
sick leave, the plan would violate this paragraph (e) (and thus also 
would violate paragraph (b) of this section) because groups of similarly 
situated individuals cannot be established based on a health factor 
(including the taking of sick leave) under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. To be eligible for coverage under a bona fide 
collectively bargained group health plan in the current calendar 
quarter, the plan requires an individual to have worked 250 hours in 
covered employment during the three-month period that ends one month 
before the beginning of the current calendar quarter. The distinction 
between employees working at least 250 hours and those working less than 
250 hours in the earlier three-month period is not directed at 
individual participants or beneficiaries based on any health factor of 
the participants or beneficiaries.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan provision does not 
violate this section because, under the rules for similarly situated 
individuals allowing full-time employees to

[[Page 607]]

be treated differently than part-time employees, employees who work at 
least 250 hours in a three-month period can be treated differently than 
employees who fail to work 250 hours in that period. The result would be 
the same if the plan permitted individuals to apply excess hours from 
previous periods to satisfy the requirement for the current quarter.
    Example 3. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, coverage of an 
employee is terminated when the individual's employment is terminated, 
in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d) of this section. Employee 
B has been covered under the plan. B experiences a disabling illness 
that prevents B from working. B takes a leave of absence under the 
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. At the end of such leave, B 
terminates employment and consequently loses coverage under the plan. 
(This termination of coverage is without regard to whatever rights the 
employee (or members of the employee's family) may have for COBRA 
continuation coverage.)
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 3, the plan provision terminating 
B's coverage upon B's termination of employment does not violate this 
section.
    Example 4. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, coverage of an 
employee is terminated when the employee ceases to perform services for 
the employer sponsoring the plan, in accordance with the rules of 
paragraph (d) of this section. Employee C is laid off for three months. 
When the layoff begins, C's coverage under the plan is terminated. (This 
termination of coverage is without regard to whatever rights the 
employee (or members of the employee's family) may have for COBRA 
continuation coverage.)
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 4, the plan provision terminating 
C's coverage upon the cessation of C's performance of services does not 
violate this section.

    (f) Bona fide wellness programs. [Reserved]
    (g) More favorable treatment of individuals with adverse health 
factors permitted--(1) In rules for eligibility. (i) Nothing in this 
section prevents a group health plan or group health insurance issuer 
from establishing more favorable rules for eligibility (described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section) for individuals with an adverse health 
factor, such as disability, than for individuals without the adverse 
health factor. Moreover, nothing in this section prevents a plan or 
issuer from charging a higher premium or contribution with respect to 
individuals with an adverse health factor if they would not be eligible 
for the coverage were it not for the adverse health factor. (However, 
other laws, including State insurance laws, may set or limit premium 
rates; these laws are not affected by this section.)
    (ii) The rules of this paragraph (g)(1) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that 
generally is available to employees, spouses of employees, and dependent 
children until age 23. However, dependent children who are disabled are 
eligible for coverage beyond age 23.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan provision allowing 
coverage for disabled dependent children beyond age 23 satisfies this 
paragraph (g)(1) (and thus does not violate this section).
    Example 2. (i) Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan, 
which is generally available to employees (and members of the employee's 
family) until the last day of the month in which the employee ceases to 
perform services for the employer. The plan generally charges employees 
$50 per month for employee-only coverage and $125 per month for family 
coverage. However, an employee who ceases to perform services for the 
employer by reason of disability may remain covered under the plan until 
the last day of the month that is 12 months after the month in which the 
employee ceased to perform services for the employer. During this 
extended period of coverage, the plan charges the employee $100 per 
month for employee-only coverage and $250 per month for family coverage. 
(This extended period of coverage is without regard to whatever rights 
the employee (or members of the employee's family) may have for COBRA 
continuation coverage.)
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan provision allowing 
extended coverage for disabled employees and their families satisfies 
this paragraph (g)(1) (and thus does not violate this section). In 
addition, the plan is permitted, under this paragraph (g)(1), to charge 
the disabled employees a higher premium during the extended period of 
coverage.
    Example 3. (i) Facts. To comply with the requirements of a COBRA 
continuation provision, a group health plan generally makes COBRA 
continuation coverage available for a maximum period of 18 months in 
connection with a termination of employment but makes the coverage 
available for a maximum period of 29 months to certain disabled 
individuals and certain members of the disabled individual's family. 
Although the plan generally requires payment of 102 percent of the 
applicable premium for the first 18 months of COBRA continuation 
coverage, the plan requires payment of 150 percent of

[[Page 608]]

the applicable premium for the disabled individual's COBRA continuation 
coverage during the disability extension if the disabled individual 
would not be entitled to COBRA continuation coverage but for the 
disability.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 3, the plan provision allowing 
extended COBRA continuation coverage for disabled individuals satisfies 
this paragraph (g)(1) (and thus does not violate this section). In 
addition, the plan is permitted, under this paragraph (g)(1), to charge 
the disabled individuals a higher premium for the extended coverage if 
the individuals would not be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage 
were it not for the disability. (Similarly, if the plan provided an 
extended period of coverage for disabled individuals pursuant to State 
law or plan provision rather than pursuant to a COBRA continuation 
coverage provision, the plan could likewise charge the disabled 
individuals a higher premium for the extended coverage.)

    (2) In premiums or contributions--(i) Nothing in this section 
prevents a group health plan or group health insurance issuer from 
charging individuals a premium or contribution that is less than the 
premium (or contribution) for similarly situated individuals if the 
lower charge is based on an adverse health factor, such as disability.
    (ii) The rules of this paragraph (g)(2) are illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. (i) Facts. Under a group health plan, employees are 
generally required to pay $50 per month for employee-only coverage and 
$125 per month for family coverage under the plan. However, employees 
who are disabled receive coverage (whether employee-only or family 
coverage) under the plan free of charge.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example, the plan provision waiving premium 
payment for disabled employees is permitted under this paragraph (g)(2) 
(and thus does not violate this section).

    (h) No effect on other laws. Compliance with this section is not 
determinative of compliance with any other provision of the PHS Act 
(including the COBRA continuation provisions) or any other State or 
federal law, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Therefore, 
although the rules of this section would not prohibit a plan or issuer 
from treating one group of similarly situated individuals differently 
from another (such as providing different benefit packages to current 
and former employees), other federal or State laws may require that two 
separate groups of similarly situated individuals be treated the same 
for certain purposes (such as making the same benefit package available 
to COBRA qualified beneficiaries as is made available to active 
employees). In addition, although this section generally does not impose 
new disclosure obligations on plans and issuers, this section does not 
affect any other laws, including those that require accurate disclosures 
and prohibit intentional misrepresentation.
    (i) Applicability dates--(1) Paragraphs applicable May 8, 2001. 
Paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iii) Example 1, 
(b)(2)(i)(A), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), and (c)(3) of this 
section and this paragraph (i)(1) apply to group health plans and health 
insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage May 8, 2001.
    (2) Paragraphs applicable for plan years beginning on or after July 
1, 2001. Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3) or (i)(4) of this 
section, the provisions of this section not listed in paragraph (i)(1) 
of this section apply to group health plans and health insurance issuers 
offering group health insurance coverage for plan years beginning on or 
after July 1, 2001. Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3) or (i)(4) of 
this section, with respect to efforts to comply with section 2702 of the 
PHS Act before the first plan year beginning on or after July 1, 2001, 
the Secretary will not take any enforcement action against an issuer or 
plan that has sought to comply in good faith with section 2702 of the 
PHS Act.
    (3) Transitional rules for individuals previously denied coverage 
based on a health factor. This paragraph (i)(3) provides rules relating 
to individuals previously denied coverage under a group health plan or 
group health insurance coverage based on a health factor of the 
individual. Paragraph (i)(3)(i) clarifies what constitutes a denial of 
coverage under this paragraph (i)(3). Paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this 
section applies with respect to any individual who was denied coverage 
if the denial was not based on a good faith interpretation of section 
2702 of the PHS Act or the Secretary's published guidance. Under that 
paragraph, such an individual must be allowed to enroll retroactively to 
the effective date of section 2702 of

[[Page 609]]

the PHS Act, or, if later, the date the individual meets eligibility 
criteria under the plan that do not discriminate based on any health 
factor. Paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section applies with respect to 
any individual who was denied coverage based on a good faith 
interpretation of section 2702 of the PHS Act or the Secretary's 
published guidance. Under that paragraph, such an individual must be 
given an opportunity to enroll effective July 1, 2001. In either event, 
whether under paragraph (i)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the 
Secretary will not take any enforcement action with respect to denials 
of coverage addressed in this paragraph (i)(3) if the issuer or plan has 
complied with the transitional rules of this paragraph (i)(3).
    (i) Denial of coverage clarified. For purposes of this paragraph 
(i)(3), an individual is considered to have been denied coverage if the 
individual--
    (A) Failed to apply for coverage because it was reasonable to 
believe that an application for coverage would have been futile due to a 
plan provision that discriminated based on a health factor; or
    (B) Was not offered an opportunity to enroll in the plan and the 
failure to give such an opportunity violates this section.
    (ii) Individuals denied coverage without a good faith interpretation 
of the law--(A) Opportunity to enroll required. If a plan or issuer has 
denied coverage to any individual based on a health factor and that 
denial was not based on a good faith interpretation of section 2702 of 
the PHS Act or any guidance published by the Secretary, the plan or 
issuer is required to give the individual an opportunity to enroll 
(including notice of an opportunity to enroll) that continues for at 
least 30 days. This opportunity must be presented not later than May 8, 
2001.
    (1) If this enrollment opportunity was presented before or within 
the first plan year beginning on or after July 1, 1997 (or in the case 
of a collectively bargained plan, before or within the first plan year 
beginning on the effective date for the plan described in section 102(c) 
(3) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), 
the coverage must be effective within that first plan year.
    (2) If this enrollment opportunity is presented after such plan 
year, the individual must be given the choice of having the coverage 
effective on either of the following two dates--
    (i) The date the plan receives a request for enrollment in 
connection with the enrollment opportunity; or
    (ii) Retroactively to the first day of the first plan year beginning 
on the effective date for the plan described in sections 102(c)(1) and 
(3) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(or, if the individual otherwise first became eligible to enroll for 
coverage after that date, on the date the individual was otherwise 
eligible to enroll in the plan). If an individual elects retroactive 
coverage, the plan or issuer is required to provide the benefits it 
would have provided if the individual had been enrolled for coverage 
during that period (irrespective of any otherwise applicable plan 
provisions governing timing for the submission of claims). The plan or 
issuer may require the individual to pay whatever additional amount the 
individual would have been required to pay for the coverage (but the 
plan or issuer cannot charge interest on that amount).
    (B) Relation to preexisting condition rules. For purposes of section 
2701 of the PHS Act, the individual may not be treated as a late 
enrollee or as a special enrollee. Moreover, the individual's enrollment 
date is the effective date for the plan described in sections 102(c)(1) 
and (3) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (or, 
if the individual otherwise first became eligible to enroll for coverage 
after that date, on the date the individual was otherwise eligible to 
enroll in the plan), even if the individual chooses under paragraph 
(i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to have coverage effective only 
prospectively. In addition, any period between the individual's 
enrollment date and the effective date of coverage is treated as a 
waiting period.
    (C) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (i)(3)(ii) are illustrated 
by the following examples:


[[Page 610]]


    Example 1. (i) Facts. Employer X maintains a group health plan with 
a plan year beginning October 1 and ending September 30. Individual F 
was hired by Employer X before the effective date of section 2702 of the 
PHS Act. Before the effective date of section 2702 of the PHS Act for 
this plan (October 1, 1997), the terms of the plan allowed employees and 
their dependents to enroll when the employee was first hired, and on 
each January 1 thereafter, but in either case, only if the individual 
could pass a physical examination. F's application to enroll when first 
hired was denied because F had diabetes and could not pass a physical 
examination. Upon the effective date of section 2702 of the PHS Act for 
this plan (October 1, 1997), the plan is amended to delete the 
requirement to pass a physical examination. In November of 1997, the 
plan gives F an opportunity to enroll in the plan (including notice of 
the opportunity to enroll) without passing a physical examination, with 
coverage effective January 1, 1998.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan complies with the 
requirements of this paragraph (i)(3)(ii).
    Example 2. (i) Facts. The plan year of a group health plan begins 
January 1 and ends December 31. Under the plan, a dependent who is 
unable to engage in normal life activities on the date coverage would 
otherwise become effective is not enrolled until the dependent is able 
to engage in normal life activities. Individual G is a dependent who is 
otherwise eligible for coverage, but is unable to engage in normal life 
activities. The plan has not allowed G to enroll for coverage.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, beginning on the effective date 
of section 2702 of the PHS Act for the plan (January 1, 1998), the plan 
provision is not permitted under any good faith interpretation of 
section 2702 of the PHS Act or any guidance published by the Secretary. 
Therefore, the plan is required, not later than May 8, 2001, to give G 
an opportunity to enroll (including notice of the opportunity to 
enroll), with coverage effective, at G's option, either retroactively 
from January 1, 1998 or prospectively from the date G's request for 
enrollment is received by the plan. If G elects coverage to be effective 
beginning January 1, 1998, the plan can require G to pay any required 
employee premiums for the retroactive coverage.

    (iii) Individuals denied coverage based on a good faith 
interpretation of the law--(A) Opportunity to enroll required. If a plan 
or issuer has denied coverage to any individual before the first day of 
the first plan year beginning on or after July 1, 2001 based in part on 
a health factor and that denial was based on a good faith interpretation 
of section 2702 of the PHS Act or guidance published by the Secretary, 
the plan or issuer is required to give the individual an opportunity to 
enroll (including notice of an opportunity to enroll) that continues for 
at least 30 days, with coverage effective no later than July 1, 2001. 
Individuals required to be offered an opportunity to enroll include 
individuals previously offered enrollment without regard to a health 
factor but subsequently denied enrollment due to a health factor.
    (B) Relation to preexisting condition rules. For purposes of section 
2701 of the PHS Act, the individual may not be treated as a late 
enrollee or as a special enrollee. Moreover, the individual's enrollment 
date is the effective date for the plan described in sections 102(c)(1) 
and (3) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (or, 
if the individual otherwise first became eligible to enroll for coverage 
after that date, on the date the individual was otherwise eligible to 
enroll in the plan). In addition, any period between the individual's 
enrollment date and the effective date of coverage is treated as a 
waiting period.
    (C) Example. The rules of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii) are illustrated 
by the following example:

    Example. (i) Facts. Individual H was hired by Employer Y on May 3, 
1995. Y maintains a group health plan with a plan year beginning on 
February 1. Under the terms of the plan, employees and their dependents 
are allowed to enroll when the employee is first hired (without a 
requirement to pass a physical examination), and on each February 1 
thereafter if the individual can pass a physical examination. H chose 
not to enroll for coverage when hired in May of 1995. On February 1, 
1997, H tried to enroll for coverage under the plan. However, H was 
denied coverage for failure to pass a physical examination. Shortly 
thereafter, Y's plan eliminated late enrollment, and H was not given 
another opportunity to enroll in the plan. There is no evidence to 
suggest that Y's plan was acting in bad faith in denying coverage under 
the plan beginning on the effective date of section 2702 of the PHS Act 
(February 1, 1998).
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example, because coverage previously had 
been made available with respect to H without regard to any health 
factor of H and because Y's plan was acting in accordance with a good 
faith interpretation of section 2702 of the PHS Act (and guidance 
published by the Secretary), the

[[Page 611]]

failure of Y's plan to allow H to enroll effective February 1, 1998 was 
permissible on that date. However, under the transitional rules of this 
paragraph (i)(3)(iii), Y's plan must give H an opportunity to enroll 
that continues for at least 30 days, with coverage effective no later 
than July 1, 2001. (In addition, February 1, 1998 is H's enrollment date 
under the plan and the period between February 1, 1998 and July 1, 2001 
is treated as a waiting period. Accordingly, any preexisting condition 
exclusion period permitted under Sec. 146.111 will have expired before 
July 1, 2001.)

    (4) Special transitional rule for self-funded non-Federal 
governmental plans exempted under 45 CFR 146.180--(i) If coverage has 
been denied to any individual because the sponsor of a self-funded non-
Federal governmental plan has elected under Sec. 146.180 to exempt the 
plan from the requirements of this section, and the plan sponsor 
subsequently chooses to bring the plan into compliance with the 
requirements of this section, the plan--
    (A) Must notify the individual that the plan will be coming into 
compliance with the requirements of this section, specify the effective 
date of compliance, and inform the individual regarding any enrollment 
restrictions that may apply under the terms of the plan once the plan is 
in compliance with this section (as a matter of administrative 
convenience, the notice may be disseminated to all employees);
    (B) Must give the individual an opportunity to enroll that continues 
for at least 30 days;
    (C) Must permit coverage to be effective as of the first day of plan 
coverage for which an exemption election under Sec. 146.180 (with regard 
to this section) is no longer in effect (or July 1, 2001, if later, and 
the plan was acting in accordance with a good faith interpretation of 
section 2702 of the PHS Act and guidance published by CMS); and
    (D) May not treat the individual as a late enrollee or a special 
enrollee.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4), an individual is 
considered to have been denied coverage if the individual failed to 
apply for coverage because, given an exemption election under Sec. 
146.180, it was reasonable to believe that an application for coverage 
would have been denied based on a health factor.
    (iii) The rules of this paragraph (i)(4) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. Individual D was hired by a non-Federal 
governmental employer in June 1996. The employer maintains a self-funded 
group health plan with a plan year beginning on October 1. Under the 
terms of the plan, employees and their dependents are allowed to enroll 
when the employee is first hired without regard to any health factor. If 
an individual declines to enroll when first eligible, the individual may 
enroll effective October 1 of any plan year if the individual can pass a 
physical examination. The plan sponsor elected under Sec. 146.180 of 
this part to exempt the plan from the requirements of this section for 
the plan year beginning October 1, 1997, and renewed the exemption 
election for the plan year beginning October 1, 1998. That is, the plan 
sponsor elected to retain the evidence of good health requirement for 
late enrollees which, absent an exemption election under Sec. 146.180 of 
this part, would have been in violation of this section as of October 1, 
1997. D chose not to enroll for coverage when first hired. In February 
of 1998, D was treated for skin cancer but did not apply for coverage 
under the plan for the plan year beginning October 1, 1998, because D 
assumed D could not meet the evidence of good health requirement. With 
the plan year beginning October 1, 1999, the plan sponsor chose not to 
renew its exemption election and brought the plan into compliance with 
this section. However, the terms of the plan, effective October 1, 1999, 
were amended to permit enrollment only during the initial 30-day period 
of employment. The plan no longer permits late enrollment under any 
circumstances, including with respect to current employees not enrolled 
in the plan. Therefore, D was not given another opportunity to enroll in 
the plan. There is no evidence to suggest that the plan was acting in 
bad faith in denying D coverage under the plan beginning on the 
effective date of Sec. 146.121 for the plan (October 1, 1999).
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 1, because the plan under Sec. 
146.180 was previously excluded from the requirements of Sec. 146.121 
and thereafter was acting in accordance with a good faith interpretation 
of Sec. 146.121 and guidance published by CMS, the failure of the plan 
to give D an opportunity to enroll effective October 1, 1999 was 
permissible on that date. However, under the transitional rules of this 
paragraph (i)(4), the plan must give D an opportunity to enroll that 
continues for at least 30 days, with coverage effective no later than 
July 1, 2001. (Additionally, October 1, 1999 is D's enrollment date 
under the plan and the period between October 1, 1999 and July 1, 2001 
is treated as a waiting period. Furthermore, if the plan sponsor has not 
elected to exempt the plan

[[Page 612]]

from limitations on preexisting condition exclusion periods, any 
preexisting condition exclusion period must be administered in 
accordance with Sec. 146.111. Accordingly, any preexisting condition 
exclusion period permitted under Sec. 146.111 will have expired before 
July 1, 2001.)
    Example 2. (i) Facts. Individual E was hired by a non-Federal 
governmental employer in February 1995. The employer maintains a self-
funded group health plan with a plan year beginning on September 1. 
Under the terms of the plan, employees and their dependents are allowed 
to enroll when the employee is first hired without regard to any health 
factor. If an individual declines to enroll when first eligible, the 
individual may enroll effective September 1 of any plan year if the 
individual can pass a physical examination. All enrollees are subject to 
a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion period. The plan sponsor 
elected under Sec. 146.180 of this part to exempt the plan from the 
requirements of this section and Sec. 146.111 (limitations on 
preexisting condition exclusion periods) for the plan year beginning 
September 1, 1997, and renews the exemption election for the plan years 
beginning September 1, 1998, September 1, 1999, and September 1, 2000. E 
chose not to enroll for coverage when first hired. In June of 2001, E is 
diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis (MS). With the plan year 
beginning September 1, 2001, the plan sponsor chooses to bring the plan 
into compliance with this section, but renews its exemption election 
with regard to limitations on preexisting condition exclusion periods. 
The plan affords E an opportunity to enroll, without a physical 
examination, effective September 1, 2001. E is subject to a 12-month 
preexisting condition exclusion period with respect to any treatment E 
receives that is related to E's MS, without regard to any prior 
creditable coverage E may have. Beginning September 1, 2002, the plan 
will cover treatment of E's MS.
    (ii) Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan complies with the 
requirements of this section. (The plan is not required to comply with 
the requirements of Sec. 146.111 because the plan continues to be 
exempted from those requirements in accordance with the plan sponsor's 
election under Sec. 146.180.)

<R05>
Sec. 146.125  Applicability dates.

    (a) General applicability dates--(1) Non-collectively bargained 
plans. Part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act and Sec.Sec. 146.101 through 
146.119, Sec. 146.143, Sec. 146.145, 45 CFR part 150, and this section 
apply with respect to group health plans, and health insurance coverage 
offered in connection with group health plans, for plan years beginning 
after June 30, 1997, except as otherwise provided in this section.
    (2) Collectively-bargained plans. Except as otherwise provided in 
this section (other than paragraph (a)(1) of this section), in the case 
of a group health plan maintained pursuant to one or more collective 
bargaining agreements between employee representatives and one or more 
employers ratified before August 21, 1996, Part A of Title XXVII of the 
PHS Act and Sec.Sec. 146.101 through 146.119, Sec. 146.143, Sec. 
146.145, 45 CFR part 150, and this section do not apply to plan years 
beginning before the later of July 1, 1997, or the date on which the 
last of the collective bargaining agreements relating to the plan 
terminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof agreed to 
after August 21, 1996). For these purposes, any plan amendment made 
under a collective bargaining agreement relating to the plan, that 
amends the plan solely to conform to any requirement of such part, is 
not treated as a termination of the collective bargaining agreement.
    (3) Preexisting condition exclusion periods for current employees. 
(i) General rule. Any preexisting condition exclusion period permitted 
under Sec. 146.111 is measured from the individual's enrollment date in 
the plan. This exclusion period, as limited under Sec. 146.111, may be 
completed before the effective date of the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) for his or her plan. Therefore, 
on the date the individual's plan becomes subject to part A of title 
XXVII of the PHS Act, no preexisting condition exclusion may be imposed 
with respect to an individual beyond the limitation in Sec. 146.111. For 
an individual who has not completed the permitted exclusion period under 
HIPAA, upon the effective date for his or her plan, the individual may 
use creditable coverage that the person had as of the enrollment date to 
reduce the remaining preexisting condition exclusion period applicable 
to the individual.
    (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(3):

    Example 1: (i) Individual A has been working for Employer X and has 
been covered under Employer X's plan since March 1, 1997.

[[Page 613]]

Under Employer X's plan, as in effect before January 1, 1998, there is 
no coverage for any preexisting condition. Employer X's plan year begins 
on January 1, 1998. A's enrollment date in the plan is March 1, 1997, 
and A has no creditable coverage before this date.
    (ii) In this Example, Employer X may continue to impose the 
preexisting condition exclusion under the plan through February 28, 1998 
(the end of the 12-month period using anniversary dates).
    Example 2: (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that A's 
enrollment date was August 1, 1996, instead of March 1, 1997.
    (ii) In this Example, on January 1, 1998, Employer X's plan may no 
longer exclude treatment for any preexisting condition that A may have; 
however, because Employer X's plan is not subject to HIPAA until January 
1, 1998, A is not entitled to claim reimbursement for expenses under the 
plan for treatments for any preexisting condition received before 
January 1, 1998.

    (b) Effective date for certification requirement--(1) General. 
Subject to the transitional rule in Sec. 146.115(a)(5)(iii), the 
certification rules of Sec. 146.115 apply to events occurring on or 
after July 1, 1996.
    (2) Period covered by certificate. A certificate is not required to 
reflect coverage before July 1, 1996.
    (3) No certificate before June 1, 1997. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this part, in no case is a certificate required to be 
provided before June 1, 1997.
    (c) Limitation on actions. No enforcement action is to be taken, 
under, against a group health plan or health insurance issuer with 
respect to a violation of a requirement imposed by part A of title XXVII 
of the PHS Act before January 1, 1998, if the plan or issuer has sought 
to comply in good faith with such requirements. Compliance with this 
part is deemed to be good faith compliance with the requirements of part 
A of title XXVII of the PHS Act.
    (d) Transition rules for counting creditable coverage. An individual 
who seeks to establish creditable coverage for periods before July 1, 
1996 is entitled to establish such coverage through the presentation of 
documents or other means in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
146.115(c). For coverage relating to an event occurring before July 1, 
1996, a group health plan and a health insurance issuer are not subject 
to any penalty or enforcement action with respect to the plan's or 
issuer's counting (or not counting) such coverage if the plan or issuer 
has sought to comply in good faith with the applicable requirements 
under Sec. 146.115(c).
    (e) Transition rules for certification of creditable coverage--(1) 
Certificates only upon request. For events occurring on or after July 1, 
1996 but before October 1, 1996, a certificate is required to be 
provided only upon a written request by or on behalf of the individual 
to whom the certificate applies.
    (2) Certificates before June 1, 1997. For events occurring on or 
after October 1, 1996 and before June 1, 1997, a certificate must be 
furnished no later than June 1, 1997, or any later date permitted under 
Sec. 146.115(a)(2) (ii) and (iii).
    (3) Optional notice--(i) General. This paragraph (e)(3) applies with 
respect to events described in Sec. 146.115(a)(2)(ii), that occur on or 
after October 1, 1996 but before June 1, 1997. A group health plan or 
health insurance issuer offering group health coverage is deemed to 
satisfy Sec.Sec. 146.115 (a)(2) and (a)(3) if a notice is provided in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through 
(e)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (ii) Time of notice. The notice must be provided no later than June 
1, 1997.
    (iii) Form and content of notice. A notice provided under this 
paragraph (e)(3) must be in writing and must include information 
substantially similar to the information included in a model notice 
authorized by CMS. Copies of the model notice are available at the 
following website--www.cms.gov (or call (410) 786-1565).
    (iv) Providing certificate after request. If an individual requests 
a certificate following receipt of the notice, the certificate must be 
provided at the time of the request as set forth in Sec. 
146.115(a)(2)(iii).
    (v) Other certification rules apply. The rules set forth in Sec. 
146.115(a)(4)(i) (method of delivery) and (a)(1) (entities required to 
provide a certificate) apply with respect to the provision of the 
notice.

[62 FR 16958, Apr. 8, 1997; 62 FR 31694, June 10, 1997, as amended at 66

<R04>
               Subpart C--Requirements Related to Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 146.130  Standards relating to benefits for mothers and newborns.

    (a) Hospital length of stay--(1) General rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a group health plan, or a health 
insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, that provides 
benefits for a hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for 
a mother or her newborn may not restrict benefits for the stay to less 
than--
    (i) 48 hours following a vaginal delivery; or
    (ii) 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section.
    (2) When stay begins--(i) Delivery in a hospital. If delivery occurs 
in a hospital, the hospital length of stay for the mother or newborn 
child begins at the time of delivery (or in the case of multiple births, 
at the time of the last delivery).
    (ii) Delivery outside a hospital. If delivery occurs outside a 
hospital, the hospital length of stay begins at the time the mother or 
newborn is admitted as a hospital inpatient in connection with 
childbirth. The determination of whether an admission is in connection 
with childbirth is a medical decision to be made by the attending 
provider.
    (3) Examples. The rules of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section are illustrated by the following examples. In each example, the 
group health plan provides benefits for hospital lengths of stay in 
connection with childbirth and is subject to the requirements of this 
section, as follows:

    Example 1. (i) A pregnant woman covered under a group health plan 
goes into labor and is admitted to the hospital at 10 p.m. on June 11. 
She gives birth by vaginal delivery at 6 a.m. on June 12.
    (ii) In this Example 1, the 48-hour period described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section ends at 6 a.m. on June 14.
    Example 2. (i) A woman covered under a group health plan gives birth 
at home by vaginal delivery. After the delivery, the woman begins 
bleeding excessively in connection with the childbirth and is admitted 
to the hospital for treatment of the excessive bleeding at 7 p.m. on 
October 1.
    (ii) In this Example 2, the 48-hour period described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section ends at 7 p.m. on October 3.
    Example 3. (i) A woman covered under a group health plan gives birth 
by vaginal delivery at home. The child later develops pneumonia and is 
admitted to the hospital. The attending provider determines that the 
admission is not in connection with childbirth.
    (ii) In this Example 3, the hospital length-of-stay requirements of 
this section do not apply to the child's admission to the hospital 
because the admission is not in connection with childbirth.

    (4) Authorization not required--(i) In general. A plan or issuer may 
not require that a physician or other health care provider obtain 
authorization from the plan or issuer for prescribing the hospital 
length of stay required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (See 
also paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(3) of this section for rules and examples 
regarding other authorization and certain notice requirements.)
    (ii) Example. The rule of this paragraph (a)(4) is illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) In the case of a delivery by cesarean section, a group 
health plan subject to the requirements of this section automatically 
provides benefits for any hospital length of stay of up to 72 hours. For 
any longer stay, the plan requires an attending provider to complete a 
certificate of medical necessity. The plan then makes a determination, 
based on the certificate of medical necessity, whether a longer stay is 
medically necessary.
    (ii) In this Example, the requirement that an attending provider 
complete a certificate of medical necessity to obtain authorization for 
the period between 72 hours and 96 hours following a delivery by 
cesarean section is prohibited by this paragraph (a)(4).

    (5) Exceptions--(i) Discharge of mother. If a decision to discharge 
a mother earlier than the period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is made by an attending provider, in consultation with the 
mother, the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not 
apply for any period after the discharge.
    (ii) Discharge of newborn. If a decision to discharge a newborn 
child earlier than the period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is made by an attending provider, in consultation with

[[Page 615]]

the mother (or the newborn's authorized representative), the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply for any 
period after the discharge.
    (iii) Attending provider defined. For purposes of this section, 
attending provider means an individual who is licensed under applicable 
State law to provide maternity or pediatric care and who is directly 
responsible for providing maternity or pediatric care to a mother or 
newborn child.
    (iv) Example. The rules of this paragraph (a)(5) are illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) A pregnant woman covered under a group health plan 
subject to the requirements of this section goes into labor and is 
admitted to a hospital. She gives birth by cesarean section. On the 
third day after the delivery, the attending provider for the mother 
consults with the mother, and the attending provider for the newborn 
consults with the mother regarding the newborn. The attending providers 
authorize the early discharge of both the mother and the newborn. Both 
are discharged approximately 72 hours after the delivery. The plan pays 
for the 72-hour hospital stays.
    (ii) In this Example, the requirements of this paragraph (a) have 
been satisfied with respect to the mother and the newborn. If either is 
readmitted, the hospital stay for the readmission is not subject to this 
section.

    (b) Prohibitions--(1) With respect to mothers--(i) In general. A 
group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health 
insurance coverage, may not--
    (A) Deny a mother or her newborn child eligibility or continued 
eligibility to enroll or renew coverage under the terms of the plan 
solely to avoid the requirements of this section; or
    (B) Provide payments (including payments-in-kind) or rebates to a 
mother to encourage her to accept less than the minimum protections 
available under this section.
    (ii) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b)(1) are illustrated by 
the following examples. In each example, the group health plan is 
subject to the requirements of this section, as follows:

    Example 1. (i) A group health plan provides benefits for at least a 
48-hour hospital length of stay following a vaginal delivery. If a 
mother and newborn covered under the plan are discharged within 24 hours 
after the delivery, the plan will waive the copayment and deductible.
    (ii) In this Example 1, because waiver of the copayment and 
deductible is in the nature of a rebate that the mother would not 
receive if she and her newborn remained in the hospital, it is 
prohibited by this paragraph (b)(1). (In addition, the plan violates 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section because, in effect, no copayment or 
deductible is required for the first portion of the stay and a double 
copayment and a deductible are required for the second portion of the 
stay.)
    Example 2. (i) A group health plan provides benefits for at least a 
48-hour hospital length of stay following a vaginal delivery. In the 
event that a mother and her newborn are discharged earlier than 48 hours 
and the discharges occur after consultation with the mother in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
the plan provides for a follow-up visit by a nurse within 48 hours after 
the discharges to provide certain services that the mother and her 
newborn would otherwise receive in the hospital.
    (ii) In this Example 2, because the follow-up visit does not provide 
any services beyond what the mother and her newborn would receive in the 
hospital, coverage for the follow-up visit is not prohibited by this 
paragraph (b)(1).

    (2) With respect to benefit restrictions--(i) In general. Subject to 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a group health plan, and a health 
insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may not 
restrict the benefits for any portion of a hospital length of stay 
required under paragraph (a) of this section in a manner that is less 
favorable than the benefits provided for any preceding portion of the 
stay.
    (ii) Example. The rules of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) A group health plan subject to the requirements of this 
section provides benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection 
with childbirth. In the case of a delivery by cesarean section, the plan 
automatically pays for the first 48 hours. With respect to each 
succeeding 24-hour period, the participant or beneficiary must call the 
plan to obtain precertification from a utilization reviewer, who 
determines if an additional 24-hour period is medically necessary. If 
this approval is not obtained, the plan will not provide benefits for 
any succeeding 24-hour period.
    (ii) In this Example, the requirement to obtain precertification for 
the two 24-hour periods immediately following the initial 48-hour

[[Page 616]]

stay is prohibited by this paragraph (b)(2) because benefits for the 
latter part of the stay are restricted in a manner that is less 
favorable than benefits for a preceding portion of the stay. (However, 
this section does not prohibit a plan from requiring precertification 
for any period after the first 96 hours.) In addition, if the plan's 
utilization reviewer denied any mother or her newborn benefits within 
the 96-hour stay, the plan would also violate paragraph (a) of this 
section.

    (3) With respect to attending providers. A group health plan, and a 
health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may 
not directly or indirectly--
    (i) Penalize (for example, take disciplinary action against or 
retaliate against), or otherwise reduce or limit the compensation of, an 
attending provider because the provider furnished care to a participant 
or beneficiary in accordance with this section; or
    (ii) Provide monetary or other incentives to an attending provider 
to induce the provider to furnish care to a participant or beneficiary 
in a manner inconsistent with this section, including providing any 
incentive that could induce an attending provider to discharge a mother 
or newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours) after delivery.
    (c) Construction. With respect to this section, the following rules 
of construction apply:
    (1) Hospital stays not mandatory. This section does not require a 
mother to--
    (i) Give birth in a hospital; or
    (ii) Stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time following the 
birth of her child.
    (2) Hospital stay benefits not mandated. This section does not apply 
to any group health plan, or any group health insurance coverage, that 
does not provide benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection 
with childbirth for a mother or her newborn child.
    (3) Cost-sharing rules--(i) In general. This section does not 
prevent a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group 
health insurance coverage from imposing deductibles, coinsurance, or 
other cost-sharing in relation to benefits for hospital lengths of stay 
in connection with childbirth for a mother or a newborn under the plan 
or coverage, except that the coinsurance or other cost-sharing for any 
portion of the hospital length of stay required under paragraph (a) of 
this section may not be greater than that for any preceding portion of 
the stay.
    (ii) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c)(3) are illustrated by 
the following examples. In each example, the group health plan is 
subject to the requirements of this section, as follows:

    Example 1. (i) A group health plan provides benefits for at least a 
48-hour hospital length of stay in connection with vaginal deliveries. 
The plan covers 80 percent of the cost of the stay for the first 24-hour 
period and 50 percent of the cost of the stay for the second 24-hour 
period. Thus, the coinsurance paid by the patient increases from 20 
percent to 50 percent after 24 hours.
    (ii) In this Example 1, the plan violates the rules of this 
paragraph (c)(3) because coinsurance for the second 24-hour period of 
the 48-hour stay is greater than that for the preceding portion of the 
stay. (In addition, the plan also violates the similar rule in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.)
    Example 2. (i) A group health plan generally covers 70 percent of 
the cost of a hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth. 
However, the plan will cover 80 percent of the cost of the stay if the 
participant or beneficiary notifies the plan of the pregnancy in advance 
of admission and uses whatever hospital the plan may designate.
    (ii) In this Example 2, the plan does not violate the rules of this 
paragraph (c)(3) because the level of benefits provided (70 percent or 
80 percent) is consistent throughout the 48-hour (or 96-hour) hospital 
length of stay required under paragraph (a) of this section. (In 
addition, the plan does not violate the rules in paragraph (a)(4) or 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.)

    (4) Compensation of attending provider. This section does not 
prevent a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group 
health insurance coverage from negotiating with an attending provider 
the level and type of compensation for care furnished in accordance with 
this section (including paragraph (b) of this section).
    (d) Notice requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)of 
this section, a group health plan that provides benefits for hospital 
lengths of stay in connection with childbirth must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) Required statement. The plan document that provides a 
description of plan benefits to participants and beneficiaries must 
disclose information

[[Page 617]]

that notifies participants and beneficiaries of their rights under this 
section.
    (2) Disclosure notice. To meet the disclosure requirement set forth 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the following disclosure notice 
must be used:

 Statement of Rights Under the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection 
                                   Act

    Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers 
offering group health insurance coverage generally may not restrict 
benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth 
for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a 
vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean 
section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the 
attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician 
assistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or 
newborn earlier.
    Also, under federal law, plans and issuers may not set the level of 
benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour 
(or 96-hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or 
newborn than any earlier portion of the stay.
    In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require 
that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for 
prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, 
to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce your out-of-pocket 
costs, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information 
on precertification, contact your plan administrator.

    (3) Timing of disclosure. The disclosure notice in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section shall be furnished to each participant covered under a 
group health plan, and each beneficiary receiving benefits under a group 
health plan, not later than 60 days after the first day of the first 
plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1999.
    (4) Exceptions. The requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply 
in the following situations:
    (i) Self-insured plans. The benefits for hospital lengths of stay in 
connection with childbirth are not provided through health insurance 
coverage, and the group health plan has made the election described in 
Sec. 146.180 to be exempted from the requirements of this section.
    (ii) Insured plans. The benefits for hospital lengths of stay in 
connection with childbirth are provided through health insurance 
coverage, and the coverage is regulated under a State law described in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Applicability in certain States--(1) Health insurance coverage. 
The requirements of section 2704 of the PHS Act and this section do not 
apply with respect to health insurance coverage offered in connection 
with a group health plan if there is a State law regulating the coverage 
that meets any of the following criteria:
    (i) The State law requires the coverage to provide for at least a 
48-hour hospital length of stay following a vaginal delivery and at 
least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a delivery by cesarean 
section.
    (ii) The State law requires the coverage to provide for maternity 
and pediatric care in accordance with guidelines established by the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, or any other established professional medical 
association.
    (iii) The State law requires, in connection with the coverage for 
maternity care, that the hospital length of stay for such care is left 
to the decision of (or is required to be made by) the attending provider 
in consultation with the mother. State laws that require the decision to 
be made by the attending provider with the consent of the mother satisfy 
the criterion of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii).
    (2) Group health plans--(i) Fully-insured plans. For a group health 
plan that provides benefits solely through health insurance coverage, if 
the State law regulating the health insurance coverage meets any of the 
criteria in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, then the requirements of 
section 2704 of the PHS Act and this section do not apply.
    (ii) Self-insured plans. For a group health plan that provides all 
benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth 
other than through health insurance coverage, the requirements of 
section 2704 of the PHS Act and this section apply.
    (iii) Partially-insured plans. For a group health plan that provides 
some benefits through health insurance coverage, if the State law 
regulating the

[[Page 618]]

health insurance coverage meets any of the criteria in paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section, then the requirements of section 2704 of the PHS Act 
and this section apply only to the extent the plan provides benefits for 
hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth other than 
through health insurance coverage.
    (3) Relation to section 2723(a) of the PHS Act. The preemption 
provisions contained in section 2723(a)(1) of the PHS Act and Sec. 
146.143(a) do not supersede a State law described in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (4) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) A group health plan buys group health insurance 
coverage in a State that requires that the coverage provide for at least 
a 48-hour hospital length of stay following a vaginal delivery and at 
least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a delivery by cesarean 
section.
    (ii) In this Example 1, the coverage is subject to State law, and 
the requirements of section 2704 of the PHS Act and this section do not 
apply.
    Example 2. (i) A self-insured group health plan covers hospital 
lengths of stay in connection with childbirth in a State that requires 
health insurance coverage to provide for maternity care in accordance 
with guidelines established by the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists and to provide for pediatric care in accordance with 
guidelines established by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    (ii) In this Example 2, even though the State law satisfies the 
criterion of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, because the plan 
provides benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with 
childbirth other than through health insurance coverage, the plan is 
subject to the requirements of section 2704 of the PHS Act and this 
section.

    (f) Effective date. Section 2704 of the PHS Act applies to group 
health plans, and health insurance issuers offering group health 
insurance coverage, for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 
1998. This section applies to group health plans, and health insurance 
issuers offering group health insurance coverage, for plan years 
beginning on or after January 1, 1999.

Sec. 146.136  Parity in the application of certain limits to mental health 
benefits.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, except where the 
context clearly indicates otherwise, the following definitions apply:
    Aggregate lifetime limit means a dollar limitation on the total 
amount of specified benefits that may be paid under a group health plan 
(or group health insurance coverage offered in connection with such 
plan) for an individual (or for a group of individuals considered a 
single unit in applying this dollar limitation, such as a family or an 
employee plus spouse).
    Annual limit means a dollar limitation on the total amount of 
specified benefits that may be paid in a 12-month period under a plan 
(or group health insurance coverage offered in connection with such 
plan) for an individual (or for a group of individuals considered a 
single unit in applying this dollar limitation, such as a family or an 
employee plus spouse).
    Medical/surgical benefits means benefits for medical or surgical 
services, as defined under the terms of the plan or group health 
insurance coverage, but does not include mental health benefits.
    Mental health benefits means benefits for mental health services, as 
defined under the terms of the plan or group health insurance coverage, 
but does not include benefits for treatment of substance abuse or 
chemical dependency.
    (b) Requirements regarding limits on benefits--(1) In general--(i) 
General parity requirement. A group health plan (or health insurance 
coverage offered by an issuer in connection with a group health plan) 
that provides both medical/surgical benefits and mental health benefits 
must comply with paragraph (b)(2), paragraph (b)(3), or paragraph (b)(6) 
of this section.
    (ii) Exception. The rule in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does 
not apply if a plan, or coverage, satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) of this section.

[[Page 619]]

    (2) Plan with no limit or limits on less than one-third of all 
medical/surgical benefits. If a plan (or group health insurance 
coverage) does not include an aggregate lifetime or annual limit on any 
medical/surgical benefits or includes aggregate lifetime or annual 
limits that apply to less than one-third of all medical/surgical 
benefits, it may not impose an aggregate lifetime or annual limit, 
respectively, on mental health benefits.
    (3) Plan with a limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical 
benefits. If a plan (or group health insurance coverage) includes an 
aggregate lifetime or annual limit on at least two-thirds of all 
medical/surgical benefits, it must either--
    (i) Apply the aggregate lifetime or annual limit both to the 
medical/surgical benefits to which the limit would otherwise apply and 
to mental health benefits in a manner that does not distinguish between 
the medical/surgical and mental health benefits; or
    (ii) Not include an aggregate lifetime or annual limit on mental 
health benefits that is less than the aggregate lifetime or annual 
limit, respectively, on the medical/surgical benefits.
    (4) Examples. The rules of paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this 
section are illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Prior to the effective date of the mental health 
parity provisions, a group health plan had no annual limit on medical/
surgical benefits and had a $10,000 annual limit on mental health 
benefits. To comply with the parity requirements of this paragraph (b), 
the plan sponsor is considering each of the following options:
    (A) Eliminating the plan's annual limit on mental health benefits;
    (B) Replacing the plan's previous annual limit on mental health 
benefits with a $500,000 annual limit on all benefits (including 
medical/surgical and mental health benefits); and
    (C) Replacing the plan's previous annual limit on mental health 
benefits with a $250,000 annual limit on medical/surgical benefits and a 
$250,000 annual limit on mental health benefits.
    (ii) In this Example 1, each of the three options being considered 
by the plan sponsor would comply with the requirements of this section 
because they offer parity in the dollar limits placed on medical/
surgical and mental health benefits.
    Example 2. (i) Prior to the effective date of the mental health 
parity provisions, a group health plan had a $100,000 annual limit on 
medical/surgical inpatient benefits, a $50,000 annual limit on medical/
surgical outpatient benefits, and a $100,000 annual limit on all mental 
health benefits. To comply with the parity requirements of this 
paragraph (b), the plan sponsor is considering each of the following 
options:
    (A) Replacing the plan's previous annual limit on mental health 
benefits with a $150,000 annual limit on mental health benefits; and
    (B) Replacing the plan's previous annual limit on mental health 
benefits with a $100,000 annual limit on mental health inpatient 
benefits and a $50,000 annual limit on mental health outpatient 
benefits.
    (ii) In this Example 2, each option under consideration by the plan 
sponsor would comply with the requirements of this section because they 
offer parity in the dollar limits placed on medical/surgical and mental 
health benefits.
    Example 3. (i) A group health plan that is subject to the 
requirements of this section has no aggregate lifetime or annual limit 
for either medical/surgical benefits or mental health benefits. While 
the plan provides medical/surgical benefits with respect to both network 
and out-of-network providers, it does not provide mental health benefits 
with respect to out-of-network providers.
    (ii) In this Example 3, the plan complies with the requirements of 
this section because they offer parity in the dollar limits placed on 
medical/surgical and mental health benefits.
    Example 4. (i) Prior to the effective date of the mental health 
parity provisions, a group health plan had an annual limit on medical/
surgical benefits and a separate but identical annual limit on mental 
health benefits. The plan included benefits for treatment of substance 
abuse and chemical dependency in its definition of mental health 
benefits. Accordingly, claims paid for treatment of substance abuse and 
chemical dependency were counted in applying the annual limit on mental 
health benefits. To comply with the parity requirements of this 
paragraph (b), the plan sponsor is considering each of the following 
options:
    (A) Making no change in the plan so that claims paid for treatment 
of substance abuse and chemical dependency continue to count in applying 
the annual limit on mental health benefits;
    (B) Amending the plan to count claims paid for treatment of 
substance abuse and chemical dependency in applying the annual limit on 
medical/surgical benefits (rather than counting those claims in applying 
the annual limit on mental health benefits);
    (C) Amending the plan to provide a new category of benefits for 
treatment of chemical dependency and substance abuse that is subject to 
a separate, lower limit and under

[[Page 620]]

which claims paid for treatment of substance abuse and chemical 
dependency are counted only in applying the annual limit on this 
separate category; and
    (D) Amending the plan to eliminate distinctions between medical/
surgical benefits and mental health benefits and establishing an overall 
limit on benefits offered under the plan under which claims paid for 
treatment of substance abuse and chemical dependency are counted with 
medical/surgical benefits and mental health benefits in applying the 
overall limit.
    (ii) In this Example 4, the group health plan is described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Because mental health benefits are 
defined in paragraph (a) of this section as excluding benefits for 
treatment of substance abuse and chemical dependency, the inclusion of 
benefits for treatment of substance abuse and chemical dependency in 
applying an aggregate lifetime limit or annual limit on mental health 
benefits under option (A) of this Example 4 would not comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. However, options (B), 
(C), and (D) of this Example 4 would comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section because they offer parity in the dollar 
limits placed on medical/surgical and mental health benefits.

    (5) Determining one-third and two-thirds of all medical/surgical 
benefits. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the determination of 
whether the portion of medical/surgical benefits subject to a limit 
represents one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits is 
based on the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/surgical 
benefits expected to be paid under the plan for the plan year (or for 
the portion of the plan year after a change in plan benefits that 
affects the applicability of the aggregate lifetime or annual limits). 
Any reasonable method may be used to determine whether the dollar 
amounts expected to be paid under the plan will constitute one-third or 
two-thirds of the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/
surgical benefits.
    (6) Plan not described in paragraph (b)(2) or paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section--(i) In general. A group health plan (or group health 
insurance coverage) that is not described in paragraph (b)(2) or 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, must either impose--
    (A) No aggregate lifetime or annual limit, as appropriate, on mental 
health benefits; or
    (B) An aggregate lifetime or annual limit on mental health benefits 
that is no less than an average limit for medical/surgical benefits 
calculated in the following manner. The average limit is calculated by 
taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime or 
annual limits, as appropriate, that are applicable to the categories of 
medical/surgical benefits. Limits based on delivery systems, such as 
inpatient/outpatient treatment, or normal treatment of common, low-cost 
conditions (such as treatment of normal births), do not constitute 
categories for purposes of this paragraph (b)(6)(i)(B). In addition, for 
purposes of determining weighted averages, any benefits that are not 
within a category that is subject to a separately-designated limit under 
the plan are taken into account as a single separate category by using 
an estimate of the upper limit on the dollar amount that a plan may 
reasonably be expected to incur with respect to such benefits, taking 
into account any other applicable restrictions under the plan.
    (ii) Weighting. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(6), the weighting 
applicable to any category of medical/surgical benefits is determined in 
the manner set forth in paragraph (b)(5) of this section for determining 
one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.
    (iii) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b)(6) are illustrated 
by the following example:

    Example. (i) A group health plan that is subject to the requirements 
of this section includes a $100,000 annual limit on medical/surgical 
benefits related to cardio-pulmonary diseases. The plan does not include 
an annual limit on any other category of medical/surgical benefits. The 
plan determines that 40% of the dollar amount of plan payments for 
medical/surgical benefits are related to cardio-pulmonary diseases. The 
plan determines that $1,000,000 is a reasonable estimate of the upper 
limit on the dollar amount that the plan may incur with respect to the 
other 60% of payments for medical/surgical benefits.
    (ii) In this Example, the plan is not described in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section because there is not one annual limit that applies to at 
least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits. Further, the plan is 
not described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section because more than one-
third of all medical/surgical benefits are subject to an annual limit.

[[Page 621]]

Under this paragraph (b)(6), the plan sponsor can choose either to 
include no annual limit on mental health benefits, or to include an 
annual limit on mental health benefits that is not less than the 
weighted average of the annual limits applicable to each category of 
medical/surgical benefits. In this example, the minimum weighted average 
annual limit that can be applied to mental health benefits is $640,000 
(40% `` $100,000 + 60% `` $1,000,000 = $640,000).

    (c) Rule in the case of separate benefit packages. If a group health 
plan offers two or more benefit packages, the requirements of this 
section, including the exemption provisions in paragraph (f) of this 
section, apply separately to each benefit package. Examples of a group 
health plan that offers two or more benefit packages include a group 
health plan that offers employees a choice between indemnity coverage or 
HMO coverage, and a group health plan that provides one benefit package 
for retirees and a different benefit package for current employees.
    (d) Applicability--(1) Group health plans. The requirements of this 
section apply to a group health plan offering both medical/surgical 
benefits and mental health benefits regardless of whether the mental 
health benefits are administered separately under the plan.
    (2) Health insurance issuers. The requirements of this section apply 
to a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage for both 
medical/surgical benefits and mental health benefits in connection with 
a group health plan.
    (3) Scope. This section does not--
    (i) Require a group health plan (or health insurance issuer offering 
coverage in connection with a group health plan) to provide any mental 
health benefits; or
    (ii) Affect the terms and conditions (including cost sharing, limits 
on the number of visits or days of coverage, requirements relating to 
medical necessity, requiring prior authorization for treatment, or 
requiring primary care physicians' referrals for treatment) relating to 
the amount, duration, or scope of the mental health benefits under the 
plan (or coverage) except as specifically provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (e) Small employer exemption--(1) In general. The requirements of 
this section do not apply to a group health plan (or health insurance 
issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) for a 
plan year of a small employer. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the 
term small employer means, in connection with a group health plan with 
respect to a calendar year and a plan year, an employer who employed an 
average of at least two but not more than 50 employees on business days 
during the preceding calendar year and who employs at least two 
employees on the first day of the plan year. See regulations at Sec. 
146.145(a), which provide that this section (and certain other sections) 
does not apply to any group health plan (and health insurance issuer 
offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) for any plan 
year if, on the first day of the plan year, the plan has fewer than two 
participants who are current employees.
    (2) Rules in determining employer size. For purposes of paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section--
    (i) All persons treated as a single employer under subsections (b), 
(c), (m), and (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(26 U.S.C. 414) are treated as one employer;
    (ii) If an employer was not in existence throughout the preceding 
calendar year, whether it is a small employer is determined based on the 
average number of employees the employer reasonably expects to employ on 
business days during the current calendar year; and
    (iii) Any reference to an employer for purposes of the small 
employer exemption includes a reference to a predecessor of the 
employer.
    (f) Increased cost exemption--(1) In general. A group health plan 
(or health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health 
plan) is not subject to the requirements of this section if the 
requirements of this paragraph (f) are satisfied. If a plan offers more 
than one benefit package, this paragraph (f) applies separately to each 
benefit package. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, a 
plan must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section for the

[[Page 622]]

first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1998, and must continue 
to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
until the plan satisfies the requirements in this paragraph (f). In no 
event is the exemption of this paragraph (f) effective until 30 days 
after the notice requirements in paragraph (f)(3) of this section are 
satisfied. If the requirements of this paragraph (f) are satisfied with 
respect to a plan, the exemption continues in effect (at the plan's 
discretion) until December 31, 2003, even if the plan subsequently 
purchases a different policy from the same or a different issuer and 
regardless of any other changes to the plan's benefit structure.
    (2) Calculation of the one-percent increase--(i) Ratio. A group 
health plan (or group health insurance coverage) satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph (f)(2) if the application of paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section to the plan (or to such coverage) results in 
an increase in the cost under the plan (or for such coverage) of at 
least one percent. The application of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section results in an increased cost of at least one percent under a 
group health plan (or for such coverage) only if the ratio below equals 
or exceeds 1.01000. The ratio is determined as follows:
    (A) The incurred expenditures during the base period, divided by,
    (B) The incurred expenditures during the base period, reduced by--
    (1) The claims incurred during the base period that would have been 
denied under the terms of the plan absent plan amendments required to 
comply with this section, and
    (2) Administrative expenses attributable to complying with the 
requirements of this section.
    (ii) Formula. The ratio of paragraph (f)(2)(i) is expressed 
mathematically as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22DE97.004

    (A) IE means the incurred expenditures during the base period.
    (B) CE means the claims incurred during the base period that would 
have been denied under the terms of the plan absent plan amendments 
required to comply with this section.
    (C) AE means administrative costs related to claims in CE and other 
administrative costs attributable to complying with the requirements of 
this section.
    (iii) Incurred expenditures. Incurred expenditures means actual 
claims incurred during the base period and reported within two months 
following the base period, and administrative costs for all benefits 
under the group health plan, including mental health benefits and 
medical/surgical benefits, during the base period. Incurred expenditures 
do not include premiums.
    (iv) Base period. Base period means the period used to calculate 
whether the plan may claim the one-percent increased cost exemption in 
this paragraph (f). The base period must begin on the first day in any 
plan year that the plan complies with the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section and must extend for a period of at least six 
consecutive calendar months. However, in no event may the base period 
begin prior to September 26, 1996 (the date of enactment of the Mental 
Health Parity Act (Pub. L. 104-204, 110 Stat. 2944)).
    (v) Rating pools. For plans that are combined in a pool for rating 
purposes, the calculation under this paragraph (f)(2) for each plan in 
the pool for the base period is based on the incurred expenditures of 
the pool, whether or not all the plans in the pool have participated in 
the pool for the entire base period. (However, only the plans that have 
complied with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for at least six 
months as a member of the pool satisfy the requirements of this 
paragraph (f)(2).) Otherwise, the calculation under this paragraph 
(f)(2) for each plan is calculated by the plan administrator (or

[[Page 623]]

issuer) based on the incurred expenditures of the plan.
    (vi) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (f)(2) are illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) A group health plan has a plan year that is the 
calendar year. The plan satisfies the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section as of January 1, 1998. On September 15, 1998, 
the plan determines that $1,000,000 in claims have been incurred during 
the period between January 1, 1998 and June 30, 1998 and reported by 
August 30, 1998. The plan also determines that $100,000 in 
administrative costs have been incurred for all benefits under the group 
health plan, including mental health benefits. Thus, the plan determines 
that its incurred expenditures for the base period are $1,100,000. The 
plan also determines that the claims incurred during the base period 
that would have been denied under the terms of the plan absent plan 
amendments required to comply with this section are $40,000 and that 
administrative expenses attributable to complying with the requirements 
of this section are $10,000. Thus, the total amount of expenditures for 
the base period had the plan not been amended to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are $1,050,000 
($1,100,000--($40,000 + $10,000) = $1,050,000).
    (ii) In this Example 1, the plan satisfies the requirements of this 
paragraph (f)(2) because the application of this section results in an 
increased cost of at least one percent under the terms of the plan 
($1,100,000/$1,050,000 = 1.04762).
    Example 2. (i) A health insurance issuer sells a group health 
insurance policy that is rated on a pooled-basis and is sold to 30 group 
health plans. One of the group health plans inquires whether it 
qualifies for the one percent increased cost exemption. The issuer 
performs the calculation for the pool as a whole and determines that the 
application of this section results in an increased cost of 0.500 
percent (for a ratio under this paragraph (f)(2) of 1.00500) for the 
pool. The issuer informs the requesting plan and the other plans in the 
pool of the calculation.
    (ii) In this Example 2, none of the plans satisfy the requirements 
of this paragraph (f)(2) and a plan that purchases a policy not 
complying with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
violates the requirements of this section. In addition, an issuer that 
issues to any of the plans in the pool a policy not complying with the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section violates the 
requirements of this section.
    Example 3. (i) A partially-insured plan is collecting the 
information to determine whether it qualifies for the exemption. The 
plan administrator determines the incurred expenses for the base period 
for the self-funded portion of the plan to be $2,000,000 and the 
administrative expenses for the base period for the self-funded portion 
to be $200,000. For the insured portion of the plan, the plan 
administrator requests data from the insurer. For the insured portion of 
the plan, the plan's own incurred expenses for the base period are 
$1,000,000 and the administrative expenses for the base period are 
$100,000. The plan administrator determines that under the self-funded 
portion of the plan, the claims incurred for the base period that would 
have been denied under the terms of the plan absent the amendment are $0 
because the self-funded portion does not cover mental health benefits 
and the plan's administrative costs attributable to complying with the 
requirements of this section are $1,000. The issuer determines that 
under the insured portion of the plan, the claims incurred for the base 
period that would have been denied under the terms of the plan absent 
the amendment are $25,000 and the administrative costs attributable to 
complying with the requirements of this section are $1,000. Thus, the 
total incurred expenditures for the plan for the base period are 
$3,300,000 ($2,000,000 + $200,000 + $1,000,000 + $100,000 = $3,300,000) 
and the total amount of expenditures for the base period had the plan 
not been amended to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section are $3,273,000 ($3,300,000 - ($0 + $1,000 + $25,000 + 
$1,000) = $3,273,000).
    (ii) In this Example 3, the plan does not satisfy the requirements 
of this paragraph (f)(2) because the application of this section does 
not result in an increased cost of at least one percent under the terms 
of the plan ($3,300,000/$3,273,000 = 1.00825).

    (3) Notice of exemption--(i) Participants and beneficiaries--(A) In 
general. A group health plan must notify participants and beneficiaries 
of the plan's decision to claim the one percent increased cost 
exemption. The notice must include the following information:
    (1) A statement that the plan is exempt from the requirements of 
this section and a description of the basis for the exemption.
    (2) The name and telephone number of the individual to contact for 
further information.
    (3) The plan name and plan number (PN).
    (4) The plan administrator's name, address, and telephone number.
    (5) For single-employer plans, the plan sponsor's name, address, and 
telephone number (if different from paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A)(3) of this 
section) and

[[Page 624]]

the plan sponsor's employer identification number (EIN).
    (6) The effective date of such exemption.
    (7) The ability of participants and beneficiaries to contact the 
plan administrator to see how benefits may be affected as a result of 
the plan's election of the exemption.
    (8) The availability, upon request and free of charge, of a summary 
of the information required under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (B) Use of summary of material reductions in covered services or 
benefits. A plan may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) 
by providing participants and beneficiaries (in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(3)(i)(C)) with a summary of material reductions in covered 
services or benefits consistent with Department of Labor regulations at 
29 CFR 2520.104b-3(d) that also includes the information of this 
paragraph (f)(3)(i). However, in all cases, the exemption is not 
effective until 30 days after notice has been sent.
    (C) Delivery. The notice described in this paragraph (f)(3)(i) is 
required to be provided to all participants and beneficiaries. The 
notice may be furnished by any method of delivery that satisfies the 
requirements of section 104(b)(1) of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1024(b)(1)) (e.g., 
first-class mail). If the notice is provided to the participant at the 
participant's last known address, then the requirements of this 
paragraph (f)(3)(i) are satisfied with respect to the participant and 
all beneficiaries residing at that address. If a beneficiary's last 
known address is different from the participant's last known address, a 
separate notice is required to be provided to the beneficiary at the 
beneficiary's last known address.
    (D) Example. The rules of this paragraph (f)(3)(i) are illustrated 
by the following example:

    Example. (i) A group health plan has a plan year that is the 
calendar year and has an open enrollment period every November 1 through 
November 30. The plan determines on September 15 that it satisfies the 
requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section. As part of its open 
enrollment materials, the plan mails, on October 15, to all participants 
and beneficiaries a notice satisfying the requirements of this paragraph 
(f)(3)(i).
    (ii) In this Example, the plan has sent the notice in a manner that 
complies with this paragraph (f)(3)(i).

    (ii) Federal agencies--(A) Church plans. A church plan (as defined 
in section 414(e) of the Internal Revenue Code) claiming the exemption 
of this paragraph (f) for any benefit package must provide notice to the 
Department of the Treasury. This requirement is satisfied if the plan 
sends a copy, to the address designated by the Secretary in generally 
applicable guidance, of the notice described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of 
this section identifying the benefit package to which the exemption 
applies.
    (B) Group health plans subject to Part 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of 
ERISA. A group health plan subject to Part 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of 
ERISA, and claiming the exemption of this paragraph (f) for any benefit 
package, must provide notice to the Department of Labor. This 
requirement is satisfied if the plan sends a copy, to the address 
designated by the Secretary in generally applicable guidance, of the 
notice described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section identifying the 
benefit package to which the exemption applies.
    (C) Non-Federal governmental plans. A group health plan that is a 
non-Federal governmental plan claiming the exemption of this paragraph 
(f) for any benefit package must provide notice to the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS). This requirement is satisfied if the 
plan sends a copy, to the address designated by the Secretary in 
generally applicable guidance, of the notice described in paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) of this section identifying the benefit package to which the 
exemption applies.
    (4) Availability of documentation. The plan (or issuer) must make 
available to participants and beneficiaries (or their representatives), 
on request and at no charge, a summary of the information on which the 
exemption was based. An individual who is not a participant or 
beneficiary and who presents a notice described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) 
of this section is considered to be a representative. A representative 
may request the summary of information by providing the plan a copy of 
the notice

[[Page 625]]

provided to the participant under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section 
with any individually identifiable information redacted. The summary of 
information must include the incurred expenditures, the base period, the 
dollar amount of claims incurred during the base period that would have 
been denied under the terms of the plan absent amendments required to 
comply with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the administrative 
costs related to those claims, and other administrative costs 
attributable to complying with the requirements for the exemption. In no 
event should the summary of information include any individually 
identifiable information.
    (g) Special rules for group health insurance coverage--(1) Sale of 
nonparity policies. An issuer may sell a policy without parity (as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section) only to a plan that meets 
the requirements of paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Duration of exemption. After a plan meets the requirements of 
paragraph (f) of this section, the plan may change issuers without 
having to meet the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section again 
before December 31, 2003.
    (h) Effective dates--(1) In general. The requirements of this 
section are applicable for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 
1998.
    (2) Limitation on actions. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(h)(3) of this section, no enforcement action is to be taken by the 
Secretary against a group health plan that has sought to comply in good 
faith with the requirements of section 2705 of the PHS Act, with respect 
to a violation that occurs before the earlier of--
    (A) The first day of the first plan year beginning on or after April 
1, 1998; or
    (B) January 1, 1999.
    (ii) Compliance with the requirements of this section is deemed to 
be good faith compliance with the requirements of section 2705 of the 
PHS Act.
    (iii) The rules of this paragraph (h)(2) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. (i) A group health plan has a plan year that is the 
calendar year. The plan complies with section 2705 of the PHS Act in 
good faith using assumptions inconsistent with paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section relating to weighted averages for categories of benefits.
    (ii) In this Example 1, no enforcement action may be taken against 
the plan with respect to a violation resulting solely from those 
assumptions and occurring before January 1, 1999.
    Example 2. (i) A group health plan has a plan year that is the 
calendar year. For the entire 1998 plan year, the plan applies a 
$1,000,000 annual limit on medical/surgical benefits and a $100,000 
annual limit on mental health benefits.
    (ii) In this Example 2, the plan has not sought to comply with the 
requirements of section 2705 of the PHS Act in good faith and this 
paragraph (h)(2) does not apply.

    (3) Transition period for increased cost exemption--(i) In general. 
No enforcement action will be taken against a group health plan that is 
subject to the requirements of this section based on a violation of this 
section that occurs before April 1, 1998 solely because the plan claims 
the increased cost exemption under section 2705(c)(2) of the PHS Act 
based on assumptions inconsistent with the rules under paragraph (f) of 
this section, provided that a plan amendment that complies with the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is adopted and 
effective no later than March 31, 1998 and the plan complies with the 
notice requirements in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Notice of plan's use of transition period. (A) A group health 
plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (h)(3)(ii) only if the 
plan provides notice to the applicable federal agency and posts the 
notice at the location(s) where documents must be made available for 
examination by participants and beneficiaries under section 104(b)(2) of 
ERISA and the regulations thereunder (29 CFR 2520.104b-1(b)(3)). The 
notice must indicate the plan's decision to use the transition period in 
paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section by 30 days after the first day of 
the plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1998, but in no event 
later than March 31, 1998. For a group health plan that is a church 
plan, the applicable federal agency is the Department of the Treasury. 
For a group health plan that is subject to Part 7 of Subtitle B of Title 
I of ERISA, the applicable federal agency is the Department of Labor.

[[Page 626]]

For a group health plan that is a nonfederal governmental plan, the 
applicable federal agency is the Department of Health and Human 
Services. The notice must include--
    (1) The name of the plan and the plan number (PN);
    (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the plan 
administrator;
    (3) For single-employer plans, the name, address, and telephone 
number of the plan sponsor (if different from the plan administrator) 
and the plan sponsor's employer identification number (EIN);
    (4) The name and telephone number of the individual to contact for 
further information; and
    (5) The signature of the plan administrator and the date of the 
signature.
    (B) The notice must be provided at no charge to participants or 
their representative within 15 days after receipt of a written or oral 
request for such notification, but in no event before the notice has 
been sent to the applicable federal agency.
    (i) Sunset. This section does not apply to benefits for services 
furnished on or after December 31, 2003.

                 Subpart D--Preemption and Special Rules


<R05>
Sec. 146.143  Preemption; State flexibility; construction.

    (a) Continued applicability of State law with respect to health 
insurance issuers. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section and except 
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, part A of title XXVII of 
the PHS Act is not to be construed to supersede any provision of State 
law which establishes, implements, or continues in effect any standard 
or requirement solely relating to health insurance issuers in connection 
with group health insurance coverage except to the extent that such 
standard or requirement prevents the application of a requirement of 
part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act.
    (b) Continued preemption with respect to group health plans. Nothing 
in part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act affects or modifies the 
provisions of section 514 of ERISA with respect to group health plans.
    (c) Special rules--(1) General. Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the provisions of part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act relating 
to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer 
supersede any provision of State law which establishes, implements, or 
continues in effect a standard or requirement applicable to imposition 
of a preexisting condition exclusion specifically governed by section 
2701 of the PHS Act, which differs from the standards or requirements 
specified in such section.
    (2) Exceptions. Only in relation to health insurance coverage 
offered by a health insurance issuer, the provisions of this part do not 
supersede any provision of State law to the extent that such provision--
    (i) Shortens the period of time from the ``6-month period'' 
described in section 2701(a)(1) of the PHS Act and Sec. 146.111(a)(1)(i) 
(for purposes of identifying a preexisting condition);
    (ii) Shortens the period of time from the ``12 months'' and ``18 
months'' described in section 2701(a)(2) of the PHS Act and Sec. 
146.111(a)(1)(ii) (for purposes of applying a preexisting condition 
exclusion period);
    (iii) Provides for a greater number of days than the ``63-day 
period'' described in sections 2701 (c)(2)(A) and (d)(4)(A) of the PHS 
Act and Sec.Sec. 146.111(a)(1)(iii) and 146.113 (for purposes of 
applying the break in coverage rules);
    (iv) Provides for a greater number of days than the ``30-day 
period'' described in sections 2701 (b)(2) and (d)(1) of the PHS Act and 
Sec. 146.111(b) (for purposes of the enrollment period and preexisting 
condition exclusion periods for certain newborns and children that are 
adopted or placed for adoption);
    (v) Prohibits the imposition of any preexisting condition exclusion 
in cases not described in section 2701(d) of the PHS Act or expands the 
exceptions described in that section;
    (vi) Requires special enrollment periods in addition to those 
required under section 2701(f) of the PHS Act; or
    (vii) Reduces the maximum period permitted in an affiliation period 
under section 701(g)(1)(B).

[[Page 627]]

    (d) Definitions--(1) State law. For purposes of this section the 
term ``State law'' includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or 
other State action having the effect of law, of any State. A law of the 
United States applicable only to the District of Columbia is treated as 
a State law rather than a law of the United States.
    (2) State. For purposes of this section the term ``State'' includes 
a State, the Northern Mariana Islands, any political subdivisions of a 
State or such Islands, or any agency or instrumentality of either.


<R05>
Sec. 146.145  Special rules relating to group health plans.

    (a) General exception for certain small group health plans. The 
requirements of this part do not apply to any group health plan (and 
group health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group 
health plan) for any plan year if, on the first day of the plan year, 
the plan has fewer than 2 participants who are current employees.
    (b) Excepted benefits--(1) General. The requirements of subpart B of 
this part do not apply to any group health plan (or any group health 
insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan) in 
relation to its provision of the benefits described in paragraph (b)(2), 
(3), (4), or (5) of this section (or any combination of these benefits).
    (2) Benefits excepted in all circumstances. The following benefits 
are excepted in all circumstances:
    (i) Coverage only for accident (including accidental death and 
dismemberment).
    (ii) Disability income insurance.
    (iii) Liability insurance, including general liability insurance and 
automobile liability insurance.
    (iv) Coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance.
    (v) Workers' compensation or similar insurance.
    (vi) Automobile medical payment insurance.
    (vii) Credit-only insurance (for example, mortgage insurance).
    (viii) Coverage for on-site medical clinics.
    (3) Limited excepted benefits--(1) General. Limited-scope dental 
benefits, limited-scope vision benefits, or long-term care benefits are 
excepted if they are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or 
contract of insurance, or are otherwise not an integral part of the 
plan, as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Integral. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, 
benefits are deemed to be an integral part of a plan unless a 
participant has the right to elect not to receive coverage for the 
benefits and, if the participant elects to receive coverage for the 
benefits, the participant pays an additional premium or contribution for 
that coverage.
    (iii) Limited scope. Limited scope dental or vision benefits are 
dental or vision benefits that are sold under a separate policy or rider 
and that are limited in scope to a narrow range or type of benefits that 
are generally excluded from hospital/medical/surgical benefits packages.
    (iv) Long-term care. Long-term care benefits are benefits that are 
either--
    (A) Subject to State long-term care insurance laws;
    (B) For qualified long-term care insurance services, as defined in 
section 7702B(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, or provided under a 
qualified long-term care insurance contract, as defined in section 
7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
    (C) based on cognitive impairment or a loss of functional capacity 
that is expected to be chronic.
    (4) Noncoordinated benefits--(i) Excepted benefits that are not 
coordinated. Coverage for only a specified disease or illness (for 
example, cancer-only policies) or hospital indemnity or other fixed 
dollar indemnity insurance (for example, $100/day) is excepted only if 
it meets each of the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of 
this section.
    (ii) Conditions. Benefits are described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of 
this section only if--
    (A) The benefits are provided under a separate policy, certificate, 
or contract of insurance;
    (B) There is no coordination between the provision of the benefits 
and an exclusion of benefits under any group health plan maintained by 
the same plan sponsor; and

[[Page 628]]

    (C) The benefits are paid with respect to an event without regard to 
whether benefits are provided with respect to the event under any group 
health plan maintained by the same plan sponsor.
    (5) Supplemental benefits. The following benefits are excepted only 
if they are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract 
of insurance:
    (i) Medicare supplemental health insurance (as defined under section 
1882(g)(1) of the Social Security Act; also known as Medigap or MedSupp 
insurance);
    (ii) Coverage supplemental to the coverage provided under Chapter 
55, Title 10 of the United States Code (also known as CHAMPUS 
supplemental programs); and
    (iii) Similar supplemental coverage provided to coverage under a 
group health plan.

<R04>
    Subpart E--Provisions Applicable to Only Health Insurance Issuers


<R05>
Sec. 146.150  Guaranteed availability of coverage for employers in the small 
group market.

    (a) Issuance of coverage in the small group market. Subject to 
paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, each health insurance issuer 
that offers health insurance coverage in the small group market in a 
State must--
    (1) Offer, to any small employer in the State, all products that are 
approved for sale in the small group market and that the issuer is 
actively marketing, and must accept any employer that applies for any of 
those products; and
    (2) Accept for enrollment under the coverage every eligible 
individual (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) who applies for 
enrollment during the period in which the individual first becomes 
eligible to enroll under the terms of the group health plan, or during a 
special enrollment period, and may not impose any restriction on an 
eligible individual's being a participant or beneficiary, which is 
inconsistent with the nondiscrimination provisions of Sec. 146.121.
    (b) Eligible individual defined. For purposes of this section, the 
term ``eligible individual'' means an individual who is eligible--
    (1) To enroll in group health insurance coverage offered to a group 
health plan maintained by a small employer, in accordance with the terms 
of the group health plan;
    (2) For coverage under the rules of the health insurance issuer 
which are uniformly applicable in the State to small employers in the 
small group market; and
    (3) For coverage in accordance with all applicable State laws 
governing the issuer and the small group market.
    (c) Special rules for network plans. (1) In the case of a health 
insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the small 
group market through a network plan, the issuer may--
    (i) Limit the employers that may apply for the coverage to those 
with eligible individuals who live, work, or reside in the service area 
for the network plan; and
    (ii) Within the service area of the plan, deny coverage to employers 
if the issuer has demonstrated to the applicable State authority (if 
required by the State authority) that--
    (A) It will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to 
enrollees of any additional groups because of its obligations to 
existing group contract holders and enrollees; and
    (B) It is applying this paragraph (c)(1) uniformly to all employers 
without regard to the claims experience of those employers and their 
employees (and their dependents) or any health status-related factor 
relating to those employees and dependents.
    (2) An issuer that denies health insurance coverage to an employer 
in any service area, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section, may not offer coverage in the small group market within the 
service area to any employer for a period of 180 days after the date the 
coverage is denied. This paragraph (c)(2) does not limit the issuer's 
ability to renew coverage already in force or relieve the issuer of the 
responsibility to renew that coverage.
    (3) Coverage offered within a service area after the 180-day period 
specified

[[Page 629]]

in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is subject to the requirements of 
this section.
    (d) Application of financial capacity limits. (1) A health insurance 
issuer may deny health insurance coverage in the small group market if 
the issuer has demonstrated to the applicable State authority (if 
required by the State authority) that it--
    (i) Does not have the financial reserves necessary to underwrite 
additional coverage; and
    (ii) Is applying this paragraph (d)(1) uniformly to all employers in 
the small group market in the State consistent with applicable State law 
and without regard to the claims experience of those employers and their 
employees (and their dependents) or any health status-related factor 
relating to those employees and dependents.
    (2) An issuer that denies group health insurance coverage to any 
small employer in a State under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may not 
offer coverage in connection with group health plans in the small group 
market in the State before the later of the following dates:
    (i) The 181st day after the date the issuer denies coverage.
    (ii) The date the issuer demonstrates to the applicable State 
authority, if required under applicable State law, that the issuer has 
sufficient financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage.
    (3) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not limit the issuer's 
ability to renew coverage already in force or relieve the issuer of the 
responsibility to renew that coverage.
    (4) Coverage offered after the 180-day period specified in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section is subject to the requirements of this section.
    (5) An applicable State authority may provide for the application of 
this paragraph (d) on a service-area-specific basis.
    (e) Exception to requirement for failure to meet certain minimum 
participation or contribution rules.
    (1) Paragraph (a) of this section does not preclude a health 
insurance issuer from establishing employer contribution rules or group 
participation rules for the offering of health insurance coverage in 
connection with a group health plan in the small group market, as 
allowed under applicable State law.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section--
    (i) The term ``employer contribution rule'' means a requirement 
relating to the minimum level or amount of employer contribution toward 
the premium for enrollment of participants and beneficiaries; and
    (ii) The term ``group participation rule'' means a requirement 
relating to the minimum number of participants or beneficiaries that 
must be enrolled in relation to a specified percentage or number of 
eligible individuals or employees of an employer.
    (f) Exception for coverage offered only to bona fide association 
members. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to health 
insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer if that coverage 
is made available in the small group market only through one or more 
bona fide associations (as defined in 45 CFR 144.103).

FR 35906, July 2, 1997; 67 FR 48811, July 26, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 146.152  Guaranteed renewability of coverage for employers in the group 
market.

    (a) General rule. Subject to paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in 
the small or large group market is required to renew or continue in 
force the coverage at the option of the plan sponsor.
    (b) Exceptions. An issuer may nonrenew or discontinue group health 
insurance coverage offered in the small or large group market based only 
on one or more of the following:
    (1) Nonpayment of premiums. The plan sponsor has failed to pay 
premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the health 
insurance coverage, including any timeliness requirements.
    (2) Fraud. The plan sponsor has performed an act or practice that 
constitutes fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material 
fact in connection with the coverage.
    (3) Violation of participation or contribution rules. The plan 
sponsor has

[[Page 630]]

failed to comply with a material plan provision relating to any employer 
contribution or group participation rules permitted under Sec. 
146.150(e) in the case of the small group market or under applicable 
State law in the case of the large group market.
    (4) Termination of plan. The issuer is ceasing to offer coverage in 
the market in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and 
applicable State law.
    (5) Enrollees' movement outside service area. For network plans, 
there is no longer any enrollee under the group health plan who lives, 
resides, or works in the service area of the issuer (or in the area for 
which the issuer is authorized to do business); and in the case of the 
small group market, the issuer applies the same criteria it would apply 
in denying enrollment in the plan under Sec. 146.150(c).
    (6) Association membership ceases. For coverage made available in 
the small or large group market only through one or more bona fide 
associations, if the employer's membership in the association ceases, 
but only if the coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any 
health status-related factor relating to any covered individual.
    (c) Discontinuing a particular product. In any case in which an 
issuer decides to discontinue offering a particular product offered in 
the small or large group market, that product may be discontinued by the 
issuer in accordance with applicable State law in the particular market 
only if--
    (1) The issuer provides notice in writing to each plan sponsor 
provided that particular product in that market (and to all participants 
and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of the discontinuation at 
least 90 days before the date the coverage will be discontinued;
    (2) The issuer offers to each plan sponsor provided that particular 
product the option, on a guaranteed issue basis, to purchase all (or, in 
the case of the large group market, any) other health insurance coverage 
currently being offered by the issuer to a group health plan in that 
market; and
    (3) In exercising the option to discontinue that product and in 
offering the option of coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
the issuer acts uniformly without regard to the claims experience of 
those sponsors or any health status-related factor relating to any 
participants or beneficiaries covered or new participants or 
beneficiaries who may become eligible for such coverage.
    (d) Discontinuing all coverage. An issuer may elect to discontinue 
offering all health insurance coverage in the small or large group 
market or both markets in a State in accordance with applicable State 
law only if--
    (1) The issuer provides notice in writing to the applicable State 
authority and to each plan sponsor (and all participants and 
beneficiaries covered under the coverage) of the discontinuation at 
least 180 days prior to the date the coverage will be discontinued; and
    (2) All health insurance policies issued or delivered for issuance 
in the State in the market (or markets) are discontinued and not 
renewed.
    (e) Prohibition on market reentry. An issuer who elects to 
discontinue offering all health insurance coverage in a market (or 
markets) in a State as described in paragraph (d) of this section may 
not issue coverage in the market (or markets) and State involved during 
the 5-year period beginning on the date of discontinuation of the last 
coverage not renewed.
    (f) Exception for uniform modification of coverage. Only at the time 
of coverage renewal may issuers modify the health insurance coverage for 
a product offered to a group health plan in the--
    (1) Large group market; and
    (2) Small group market if, for coverage available in this market 
(other than only through one or more bona fide associations), the 
modification is consistent with State law and is effective uniformly 
among group health plans with that product.
    (g) Application to coverage offered only through associations. In 
the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health 
insurance issuer in the small or large group market to employers only 
through one or more associations, the reference to ``plan sponsor'' is 
deemed, with respect to coverage provided to an employer

Sec. 146.160  Disclosure of information.

    (a) General rule. In connection with the offering of any health 
insurance coverage to a small employer, a health insurance issuer is

coverage for which the employer is qualified, under applicable State

    (c) Form of information. The information must be described in 
language that is understandable by the average small employer, with a 
level of detail that is sufficient to reasonably inform small employers 
of their rights and obligations under the health insurance coverage.

coverage means a description of benefits in summary form.
    (2) The rate or rating schedule that applies to the product (with 
and without the preexisting condition exclusion or affiliation period).
    (3) The minimum employer contribution and group participation rules

              Subpart F--Exclusion of Plans and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 146.180  Treatment of non-Federal governmental plans.

    (a) Requirements subject to exemption--(1) Basic rule. A sponsor of 
a non-Federal governmental plan may elect to exempt its plan, to the 
extent that the plan is not provided through health insurance coverage, 
(that is, it is self-funded), from any or all of the following 
requirements:
    (i) Limitations on preexisting condition exclusion periods described 
in Sec. 146.111.
    (ii) Special enrollment periods for individuals and dependents 
described in Sec. 146.117.
    (iii) Prohibitions against discriminating against individual 
participants and beneficiaries based on health status described in Sec. 
146.121.
    (iv) Standards relating to benefits for mothers and newborns 
described in Sec. 146.130.
    (v) Parity in the application of certain limits to mental health 
benefits described in Sec. 146.136.
    (vi) Required coverage for reconstructive surgery and certain other 
services following a mastectomy under section 2706 of the PHS Act.

[[Page 632]]

    (2) Limitations. (i) An election under this section cannot 
circumvent a requirement of this part to the extent the requirement 
applied to the plan before the effective date of the election.
    (A) Example 1. A plan is subject to requirements of section 2706 of 
the PHS Act, under which a plan that covers medical and surgical 
benefits with respect to a mastectomy must cover reconstructive surgery 
and certain other services following a mastectomy. An enrollee who has 
had a mastectomy receives reconstructive surgery on August 24. Claims 
with respect to the surgery are submitted to and processed by the plan 
in September. The group health plan commences a new plan year each 
September 1. Effective September 1, the plan sponsor elects to exempt 
its plan from section 2706 of the PHS Act. The plan cannot, on the basis 
of its exemption election, decline to pay for the claims incurred on 
August 24.
    (B) Example 2. An individual is hired by a non-Federal governmental 
employer and reports to work on August 6. The individual has diabetes. 
Under the terms of the plan in effect on August 6, if an individual 
files an enrollment application within the first 30 days of employment, 
enrollment in the plan is effective as of the first day of employment. 
The individual timely files an enrollment application. The application 
is processed on September 10. The group health plan commences a new plan 
year each September 1. Effective September 1, the plan sponsor elects to 
exempt its plan from Sec. 146.121, which prohibits enrollment 
discrimination based on health status-related factors, by requiring new 
enrollees to pass medical underwriting. The plan cannot decline to 
enroll the individual effective August 6, even if he would not pass 
medical underwriting under the terms of the plan in effect on September 
1.
    (ii) If a group health plan is co-sponsored by two or more 
employers, then only plan enrollees of the non-Federal governmental 
employer(s) with a valid election under this section are affected by the 
election.
    (3) Stop-loss or excess risk coverage. For purposes of this section. 
(i) Subject to paragraph (a)(3)(ii), the purchase of stop-loss or excess 
risk coverage by a self-funded non-Federal governmental plan does not 
prevent an election under this section.
    (ii) Regardless of whether coverage offered by an issuer is 
designated as ``stop-loss'' coverage or ``excess risk'' coverage, if it 
is regulated as group health insurance under an applicable State law, 
then for purposes of this section, a non-Federal governmental plan that 
purchases the coverage is considered to be fully insured. In that event, 
a plan may not be exempted under this section from the requirements of 
this part.
    (4) Construction. Nothing in this part should be construed as 
imposing collective bargaining obligations on any party to the 
collective bargaining process.
    (b) Form and manner of election--(1) Election requirements. The 
election must meet the following requirements:
    (i) Be made in writing.
    (ii) Be made in conformance with all of the plan sponsor's rules, 
including any public hearing requirements.
    (iii) Specify the beginning and ending dates of the period to which 
the election is to apply. This period can be either of the following 
periods:
    (A) A single specified plan year, as defined in Sec. 144.103 of this 
subchapter.
    (B) The ``term of the agreement,'' as specified in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, in the case of a plan governed by collective 
bargaining.
    (iv) Specify the name of the plan and the name and address of the 
plan administrator, and include the name and telephone number of a 
person CMS may contact regarding the election.
    (v) State that the plan does not include health insurance coverage, 
or identify which portion of the plan is not funded through health 
insurance coverage.
    (vi) Specify each requirement described in paragraph (a) of this 
section from which the plan sponsor elects to exempt the plan.
    (vii) Certify that the person signing the election document, 
including (if applicable) a third party plan administrator, is legally 
authorized to do so by the plan sponsor.
    (viii) Include, as an attachment, a copy of the notice described in 
paragraph (f) of this section.

[[Page 633]]

    (2) ``Term of the agreement'' defined. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii), for purposes of this section ``term 
of the agreement'' means all group health plan years governed by a 
single collective bargaining agreement.
    (i) In the case of a group health plan for which the last plan year 
governed by a prior collective bargaining agreement expires during the 
bargaining process for a new agreement, the term of the prior agreement 
includes all plan years governed by the agreement plus the period of 
time that precedes the latest of the following dates, as applicable, 
with respect to the new agreement:
    (A) The date of an agreement between the governmental employer and 
union officials.
    (B) The date of ratification of an agreement between the 
governmental employer and the union.
    (C) The date impasse resolution, arbitration or other closure of the 
collective bargaining process is finalized when agreement is not 
reached.
    (ii) In the case of a group health plan governed by a collective 
bargaining agreement for which closure is not reached before the last 
plan year under the immediately preceding agreement expires, the term of 
the new agreement includes all plan years governed by the agreement 
excluding the period that precedes the latest applicable date specified 
in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Construction--(i) Dispute resolution. Nothing in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section should be construed to mean that CMS 
arbitrates disputes between plan sponsors, participants, beneficiaries, 
or their representatives regarding whether an election complies with all 
of a plan sponsor's rules.
    (ii) Future elections not preempted. If a plan must comply with one 
or more requirements of this part for a given plan year or period of 
plan coverage, nothing in this section should be construed as preventing 
a plan sponsor from submitting an election in accordance with this 
section for a subsequent plan year or period of plan coverage.
    (c) Mailing address. The plan sponsor should mail the election to: 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Private Health Insurance 
Group, CMSO, 7500 Security Boulevard, S3-16-16, Baltimore, MD 21244-
1850.
    (d) Filing a timely election. (1) Plan not governed by collective 
bargaining. Subject to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, if a plan is 
not governed by a collective bargaining agreement, a plan sponsor or 
entity acting on behalf of a plan sponsor must file an election with CMS 
before the first day of the plan year.
    (2) Plan governed by a collective bargaining agreement. Subject to 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section, if a plan is governed by a collective 
bargaining agreement, a plan sponsor or entity acting on behalf of a 
plan sponsor must file an election with CMS before the first day of the 
first plan year governed by a collective bargaining agreement, or by the 
45th day after the latest applicable date specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section, if the 45th day falls on or after the first 
day of the plan year.
    (3) Verifying timely filing. CMS uses the postmark on the envelope 
in which the election is submitted to determine that the election is 
timely filed as specified under paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this 
section, as applicable. If the latest filing date falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or a State or Federal holiday, CMS accepts a postmark on the 
next business day.
    (4) Filing extension based on good cause. CMS may extend the 
deadlines specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section for 
good cause if the plan substantially complies with the requirements of 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (5) Failure to file a timely election. Absent an extension under 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a plan sponsor's failure to file a 
timely election under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section makes 
the plan subject to all requirements of this part for the entire plan 
year to which the election would have applied, or, in the case of a plan 
governed by a collective bargaining agreement, for any plan years under 
the agreement for which the election is not timely filed.
    (e) Additional information required--(1) Written notification. If an 
election is timely filed, but CMS determines that the election document 
(or the notice to plan enrollees) does not meet all of the

[[Page 634]]

requirements of this section, CMS may notify the plan sponsor, or other 
entity that filed the election, that it must submit any additional 
information that CMS has determined is necessary to meet those 
requirements. The additional information must be filed with CMS by the 
later of the following dates:
    (i) The last day of the plan year.
    (ii) The 45th day after the date of CMS's written notification 
requesting additional information.
    (2) Timely response. CMS uses the postmark on the envelope in which 
the additional information is submitted to determine that the 
information is timely filed as specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section. If the latest filing date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a 
State or Federal holiday, CMS accepts a postmark on the next business 
day.
    (3) Failure to respond timely. CMS may invalidate an election if the 
plan sponsor, or other entity that filed the election, fails to timely 
submit the additional information as specified under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (f) Notice to enrollees--(1) Mandatory notification. (i) A plan that 
makes the election described in this section must notify each affected 
enrollee of the election, and explain the consequences of the election. 
For purposes of this paragraph (f), if the dependent(s) of a participant 
reside(s) with the participant, a plan need only provide notice to the 
participant.
    (ii) The notice must be in writing and, except as provided in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section with regard to initial notices, must be 
provided to each enrollee at the time of enrollment under the plan, and 
on an annual basis no later than the last day of each plan year (as 
defined in Sec. 144.103 of this subchapter) for which there is an 
election.
    (iii) A plan may meet the notification requirements of this 
paragraph (f) by prominently printing the notice in a summary plan 
description, or equivalent description, that it provides to each 
enrollee at the time of enrollment, and annually. Also, when a plan 
provides a notice to an enrollee at the time of enrollment, that notice 
may serve as the initial annual notice for that enrollee.
    (2) Initial notices. (i) If a plan is not governed by a collective 
bargaining agreement, with regard to the initial plan year to which an 
election under this section applies, the plan must provide the initial 
annual notice of the election to all enrollees before the first day of 
that plan year, and notice at the time of enrollment to all individuals 
who enroll during that plan year.
    (ii) In the case of a collectively bargained plan (including a self-
funded non-Federal governmental plan that has been exempted from 
requirements of this part under Sec. 146.125(a)(2)), with regard to the 
initial plan year to which an election under this section applies, the 
plan must provide the initial annual notice of the election to all 
enrollees before the first day of the plan year, or within 30 days after 
the latest applicable date specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section if the 30th day falls on or after the first day of the plan 
year. Also, the plan must provide a notice at the time of enrollment to 
individuals who--
    (A) Enroll on or after the first day of the plan year, when closure 
of the collective bargaining process is reached before the plan year 
begins; or
    (B) Enroll on or after the latest applicable date specified in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if that date falls on or after the 
first day of the plan year.
    (3) Notice content. The notice must include at least the following 
information:
    (i) The specific requirements described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section from which the plan sponsor is electing to exempt the plan, and 
a statement that, in general, Federal law imposes these requirements 
upon group health plans.
    (ii) A statement that Federal law gives the plan sponsor of a self-
funded non-Federal governmental plan the right to exempt the plan in 
whole, or in part, from the listed requirements, and that the plan 
sponsor has elected to do so.
    (iii) A statement identifying which parts of the plan are subject to 
the election.
    (iv) A statement identifying which of the listed requirements, if 
any, apply

[[Page 635]]

under the terms of the plan, or as required by State law, without regard 
to an exemption under this section.
    (v) A statement informing plan enrollees that the plan provides for 
certification and disclosure of creditable coverage for covered 
employees and their dependents who lose coverage under the plan.
    (g) Subsequent elections--(1) Election renewal. A plan sponsor may 
renew an election under this section through subsequent elections. The 
timeliness standards described in paragraph (d) apply to election 
renewals under this paragraph (g).
    (2) Form and manner of renewal. Except for the requirement to 
forward to CMS a copy of the notice to enrollees under paragraph 
(b)(1)(viii) of this section, the plan sponsor must comply with the 
election requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In lieu of 
providing a copy of the notice under (b)(1)(viii), the plan sponsor may 
include a statement that the notice has been, or will be, provided to 
enrollees as specified under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) Election renewal includes provisions from which plan not 
previously exempted. If an election renewal includes a requirement 
described in paragraph (a) of this section from which the plan sponsor 
did not elect to exempt the plan for the preceding plan year, the 
advance notification requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
apply with respect to the additional requirement(s) of paragraph (a) 
from which the plan sponsor is electing to exempt the plan.
    (4) Special rules regarding renewal of an election under a 
collective bargaining agreement. (i) If protracted negotiations with 
respect to a new agreement result in an extension of the term of the 
prior agreement (as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(i)) under which an 
election under this section was in effect, the plan must comply with the 
enrollee notification requirements of paragraph (f)(1), and, following 
closure of the collective bargaining process, must file an election 
renewal with CMS as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) If a single plan applies to more than one bargaining unit, and 
the plan is governed by collective bargaining agreements of varying 
lengths, paragraph (d)(2) of this section, with respect to an election 
renewal, applies to the plan as governed by the agreement that results 
in the earliest filing date.
    (h) Certification and disclosure of creditable coverage. Without 
regard to an election under this section, a non-Federal governmental 
plan must provide for certification and disclosure of creditable 
coverage under the plan with respect to participants and their 
dependents as specified under Sec. 146.115. CMS enforces this 
requirement as provided under paragraph (k) of this section.
    (i) Effect of failure to comply with certification and notification 
requirements--(1) Substantial failure. (i) General rule. Except as 
provided in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section, a substantial failure 
to comply with paragraphs (f) or (h) of this section results in the 
invalidation of an election under this section with respect to all plan 
enrollees for the entire plan year. That is, the plan is subject to all 
requirements of this part for the entire plan year to which the election 
otherwise would have applied.
    (ii) Determination of substantial failure. CMS determines whether a 
plan has substantially failed to comply with a requirement of paragraph 
(f) or paragraph (h) of this section based on all relevant facts and 
circumstances, including previous record of compliance, gravity of the 
violation and whether a plan corrects the failure, as warranted, within 
30 days of learning of the violation. However, in general, a plan's 
failure to provide a notice of the fact and consequences of an election 
under this section to an individual at the time of enrollment, or on an 
annual basis before a given plan year expires, constitutes a substantial 
failure.
    (iii) Exceptions--(A) Multiple employers. If the plan is sponsored 
by multiple employers, and only certain employers substantially fail to 
comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f) or (h) of this section, 
then the election is invalidated with respect to those employers only, 
and not with respect to other employers that complied with those 
requirements, unless the plan chooses to cancel its election entirely.
    (B) Limited failure to provide notice. If a substantial failure to 
notify enrollees

[[Page 636]]

of the fact and consequences of an election is limited to certain 
individuals, the election under this section is valid only if, for the 
plan year with respect to which the failure has occurred, the plan 
agrees not to apply the election with respect to the individuals who 
were not notified and so informs those individuals in writing.
    (2) Examples. (i) Example 1: A self-funded non-Federal group health 
plan is co-sponsored by 10 school districts. Nine of the school 
districts have fully complied with the requirements of paragraph (f) of 
this section, including providing notice to new employees at the time of 
their enrollment in the plan, regarding the group health plan's 
exemption under this section from requirements of this part. One school 
district, which hired 10 new teachers during the summer for the upcoming 
school year, neglected to notify three of the new hires about the group 
health plan's exemption election at the time they enrolled in the plan. 
The school district has substantially failed to comply with a 
requirement of paragraph (f) with respect to these individuals.
    The school district learned of the oversight six weeks into the 
school year, and promptly (within 30 days of learning of the oversight) 
provided notice to the three teachers regarding the plan's exemption 
under this section and that the exemption does not apply to them, or 
their dependents, during the plan year of their enrollment because of 
the plan's failure to timely notify them of its exemption. The plan 
complies with the requirements of this part for these individuals for 
the plan year of their enrollment. CMS would not require the plan to 
come into compliance with the requirements of this part for other 
enrollees.
    (ii) Example 2: Same facts as in Example 1, except the noncompliant 
school district failed to notify any enrollees regarding an election 
under this section. That is, the school district failed to provide the 
annual notice to current plan enrollees as well as the notice at the 
time of enrollment to new enrollees. The school district has 
substantially failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of 
this section. At a minimum, the election is invalidated with respect to 
all enrollees of the noncompliant school district for the plan year for 
which the substantial failure has occurred. In this example, the plan 
decides not to cancel its election entirely. The election with regard to 
the other nine school districts remains in effect.
    (iii) Example 3. Two non-Federal governmental employers cosponsor a 
self-funded group health plan. One employer substantially fails to 
comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. While the 
plan may limit the invalidation of the election to enrollees of the plan 
sponsor that is responsible for the substantial failure, the plan 
sponsors determine that administering the plan in that manner would be 
too burdensome. Accordingly, in this example, the plan sponsors choose 
to cancel the election entirely. Both plan sponsors come into compliance 
with the requirements of this part with respect to all enrollees for the 
plan year for which the substantial failure has occurred.
    (iv) Example 4: A non-Federal governmental employer has elected to 
exempt its collectively bargained self-funded plan from certain 
requirements of this part. The collective bargaining agreement applies 
to five plan years, 2001 through 2005. For the first three plan years, 
enrollees are notified annually and at the time of enrollment of the 
election under this section. The notice specifies that the election 
applies to the period January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2005. Prior 
to the dissemination of the annual notice for the 2004 plan year, the 
individual responsible for disseminating the notice terminates 
employment. His replacement, who is unaware of the requirement that plan 
enrollees be notified annually, continues to notify new enrollees at the 
time of enrollment but fails to disseminate the annual notice. CMS does 
not consider that failure to be a substantial failure because enrollees 
previously had actual notice that the election under this section 
applies for the period January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2005. 
Accordingly, CMS would not invalidate the election for the 2004 plan 
year.
    (v) Example 5: A non-Federal governmental employer has elected to 
exempt

[[Page 637]]

its self-funded plan from certain requirements of this part. An 
individual terminates employment with the governmental employer, which 
fails to automatically provide a certificate of creditable coverage 
within the period specified in Sec. 146.115(a)(2)(ii)(A). (The 
governmental employer generally provides certificates to terminated 
employees on an automatic basis, but neglected to do so in this case.) 
The oversight is brought to the employer's attention when the individual 
inquires as to why he has not received his certificate of creditable 
coverage. The governmental employer promptly (within 30 days) forwards a 
certificate to the individual. CMS would not view that situation as 
constituting a substantial failure and would not invalidate the election 
under this section.
    (j) Election invalidated. If CMS finds cause to invalidate an 
election under this section, the following rules apply:
    (1) CMS notifies the plan sponsor (and the plan administrator if 
other than the plan sponsor and the administrator's address is known to 
CMS) in writing that CMS has made a preliminary determination that an 
election is invalid, and states the basis for that determination.
    (2) CMS's notice informs the plan sponsor that it has 45 days after 
the date of CMS's notice to explain in writing why it believes its 
election is valid. The plan sponsor should provide applicable statutory 
and regulatory citations to support its position.
    (3) CMS verifies that the plan sponsor's response is timely filed as 
provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. CMS will not consider a 
response that is not timely filed.
    (4) If CMS's preliminary determination that an election is invalid 
remains unchanged after CMS considers the plan sponsor's timely response 
(or in the event that the plan sponsor fails to respond timely), CMS 
provides written notice to the plan sponsor (and the plan administrator 
if other than the plan sponsor and the administrator's address is known 
to CMS) of CMS's final determination that the election is invalid. Also, 
CMS informs the plan sponsor that, within 45 days of the date of the 
notice of final determination, the plan, subject to paragraph 
(i)(1)(iii) of this section, must comply with all requirements of this 
part for the specified period for which CMS has determined the election 
to be invalid.
    (k) Enforcement. To the extent that an election under this section 
has not been filed or a non-Federal governmental plan otherwise is 
subject to one or more requirements of this part, CMS enforces those 
requirements under part 150 of this subchapter. This may include 
imposing a civil money penalty against the plan or the plan sponsor, as 
determined under Sec. 150.305.
    (l) Construction. Nothing in this section should be construed to 
prevent a State from taking the following actions:
    (1) Establishing, and enforcing compliance with, the requirements of 
State law (as defined in Sec. 146.143(d)(1)), including requirements 
that parallel provisions of title XXVII of the PHS Act, that apply to 
non-Federal governmental plans or sponsors.
    (2) Prohibiting a sponsor of a non-Federal governmental plan within 
the State from making an election under this section.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 148.101  Basis and purpose.

    This part implements sections 2741 through 2763 and 2791 and 2792 of 
the PHS Act. Its purpose is to improve access to individual health 
insurance coverage for certain eligible individuals who previously had 
group coverage, and to guarantee the renewability of all coverage in the 
individual market. It also provides certain protections for mothers and 
newborns with respect to coverage for hospital stays in connection with 
childbirth.

[63 FR 57561, Oct. 27, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 148.102  Scope, applicability, and effective dates.

    (a) Scope and applicability. (1) Individual health insurance 
coverage includes all health insurance coverage (as defined in Sec. 
144.103) that is neither health insurance coverage sold in connection 
with an employment-related group health plan, nor short-term, limited-
duration coverage as defined in Sec. 144.103 of this subchapter. In some 
cases, coverage that may be considered group coverage under State law 
(such as coverage sold through certain associations) is considered 
individual coverage.
    (2) The requirements of this part that pertain to guaranteed 
availability of individual health insurance coverage for certain 
eligible individuals apply to all issuers of individual health insurance 
coverage in a State, unless the State implements an acceptable 
alternative mechanism as described in Sec. 148.128. The requirements 
that pertain to guaranteed renewability for all individuals, and to 
protections for mothers and newborns with respect to hospital stays in 
connection with childbirth, apply to all issuers of individual health 
insurance coverage in the State, regardless of whether a State 
implements an alternative mechanism.
    (b) Effective date. Except as provided in Sec.Sec. 148.124 
(certificate of coverage), 148.128 (alternative State mechanisms), and 
148.170 (standards relating to benefits for mothers and newborns), the 
requirements of this part apply to health insurance coverage offered, 
sold, issued, renewed, in effect, or operated in the individual market 
after June 30, 1997, regardless of when a period of creditable coverage 
occurs.

[62 FR 16995, Apr. 8, 1997; 62 FR 31695, June 10, 1997, as amended at 63 
FR 57562, Oct. 27, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 148.103  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise provided, the following definition applies:
    Eligible individual means an individual who meets the following 
conditions:
    (1) The individual has at least 18 months of creditable coverage (as 
determined under Sec. 146.113 of this subchapter) as of the date on 
which the individual seeks coverage under this part.
    (2) The individual's most recent prior creditable coverage was under 
a group health plan, governmental plan, or church plan (or health 
insurance coverage offered in connection with any of these plans).
    (3) The individual is not eligible for coverage under any of the 
following:
    (i) A group health plan.
    (ii) Part A or Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social 
Security Act.

[[Page 639]]

    (iii) A State plan under Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security 
Act (or any successor program).
    (4) The individual does not have other health insurance coverage.
    (5) The individual's most recent coverage was not terminated because 
of nonpayment of premiums or fraud. (For more information about 
nonpayment of premiums or fraud, see Sec. 146.152(b)(1) and (b)(2) of 
this subchapter.)
    (6) If the individual has been offered the option of continuing 
coverage under a COBRA continuation provision or a similar State 
program, the individual has both elected and exhausted the continuation 
coverage.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this 
section, an issuer that furnishes health insurance coverage in the 
individual market must meet the following requirements with respect to 
any eligible individual who requests coverage:
    (1) May not decline to offer coverage or deny enrollment under any 
policy forms that it actively markets in the individual market, except 
as permitted in paragraph (c) of this section concerning alternative 
coverage when no State mechanism exists. An issuer is deemed to meet 
this requirement if, upon the request of an eligible individual, it acts 
promptly to do the following:
    (i) Provide information about all available coverage options.
    (ii) Enroll the individual in any coverage option the individual 
selects.
    (2) May not impose any preexisting condition exclusion on the 
individual.
    (b) Exception. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do 
not apply to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market 
in a State that chooses to implement an acceptable alternative mechanism 
described in Sec. 148.128.
    (c) Alternative coverage permitted where no State mechanism exists. 
(1) General rule. If the State does not implement an acceptable 
alternative mechanism under Sec. 148.128, an issuer may elect to limit 
the coverage required under paragraph (a) of this section if it offers 
eligible individuals at least two policy forms that meet the following 
requirements:
    (i) Each policy form must be designed for, made generally available 
to, and actively marketed to, and enroll, both eligible and other 
individuals.
    (ii) The policy forms must be either the issuer's two most popular 
policy forms (as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) or 
representative samples of individual health insurance offered by the 
issuer in the State (as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
    (2) Most popular policies. The two most popular policy forms means 
the policy forms with the largest, and the second largest, premium 
volume for the last reporting year, for policies offered in that State. 
In the absence of applicable State standards, premium volume means 
earned premiums for the last reporting year. In the absence of 
applicable State standards, the last reporting year is the period from 
October 1 through September 30 of the preceding year. Blocks of business 
closed under applicable State law are not included in calculating 
premium volume.
    (3) Representative policy forms--(i) Definition of weighted average. 
Weighted average means the average actuarial value of the benefits 
provided by all the health insurance coverage issued by one of the 
following:
    (A) An issuer in the individual market in a State during the 
previous calendar year, weighted by enrollment for each policy form, but 
not including coverage issued to eligible individuals.
    (B) All issuers in the individual market in a State if the data are 
available for the previous calendar year, weighted by enrollment for 
each policy form.
    (ii) Requirements. The two representative policy forms must meet the 
following requirements:
    (A) Include a lower-level coverage policy form under which the 
actuarial value of benefits under the coverage is

[[Page 640]]

at least 85 percent but not greater than 100 percent of the weighted 
average.
    (B) Include a higher-level coverage policy form under which the 
actuarial value of the benefits under the coverage is at least 15 
percent greater than the actuarial value of the lower-level coverage 
policy form offered by an issuer in that State and at least 100 percent, 
but not greater than 120 percent, of the weighted average.
    (C) Include benefits substantially similar to other individual 
health insurance coverage offered by the issuer in the State.
    (D) Provide for risk adjustment, risk spreading, or a risk spreading 
mechanism, or otherwise provide some financial subsidization for 
eligible individuals.
    (E) Meet all applicable State requirements.
    (iii) Actuarial value of benefits. The actuarial value of benefits 
provided under individual health insurance coverage must be calculated 
based on a standardized population, and a set of standardized 
utilization and cost factors under applicable State law.
    (4) Election. All issuer elections must be applied uniformly to all 
eligible individuals in the State and must be effective for all policies 
offered during a period of at least 2 years.
    (5) Documentation. The issuer must document the actuarial 
calculations it makes as follows:
    (i) Enforcement by State. In a State that elects to enforce the 
provisions of this section in lieu of an alternative mechanism under 
Sec. 148.128, the issuer must provide the appropriate State authorities 
with the documentation required by the State.
    (ii) Enforcement by CMS. If CMS acts to enforce the provisions of 
this section under Sec. 148.200, the issuer must provide to CMS, within 
the following time frames, any documentation CMS requests:
    (A) For policy forms already being marketed as of July 1, 1997--no 
later than September 1, 1997.
    (B) For other policy forms--90 days before the beginning of the 
calendar year in which the issuer wants to market the policy form.
    (d) Special rules for network plans. (1) An issuer that offers 
coverage in the individual market through a network plan may take the 
following actions:
    (i) Specify that an eligible individual may only enroll if he or she 
lives, resides, or works within the service area for the network plan.
    (ii) Deny coverage to an eligible individual if the issuer has 
demonstrated the following to the applicable State authority (if 
required by the State):
    (A) It does not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to 
additional individual enrollees because of its obligations to provide 
services to current group contract holders and enrollees, and to current 
individual enrollees.
    (B) It uniformly denies coverage to individuals without regard to 
any health status-related factor, and without regard to whether the 
individuals are eligible individuals.
    (iii) Not offer any coverage in the individual market, within the 
service area identified for purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this 
section, for a period of 180 days after the coverage is denied.
    (2) In those States in which CMS is enforcing the individual market 
provisions of this part in accordance with Sec. 148.200, the issuer must 
make the demonstration described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section 
to CMS rather than to the State, and the issuer may not deny coverage to 
any eligible individual until 30 days after CMS receives and approves 
the information.
    (e) Application of financial capacity limits. (1) An issuer may deny 
coverage to an eligible individual if the issuer has demonstrated the 
following to the applicable State authority (if required by the State):
    (i) It does not have the financial reserves necessary to underwrite 
additional coverage.
    (ii) It uniformly denies coverage to all individuals in the 
individual market, consistent with applicable State law, without regard 
to any health status-related factor of the individuals, and without 
regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.
    (2) In those States in which CMS is enforcing the individual market 
provisions of this part in accordance with Sec. 148.200, the issuer must 
make the demonstration described in paragraph

[[Page 641]]

(e)(1) of this section to CMS rather than to the State, and the issuer 
may not deny coverage to any eligible individual until 30 days after CMS 
receives and approves the information.
    (3) An issuer that denies coverage in any service area according to 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section is prohibited from offering that 
coverage in the individual market for a period of 180 days after the 
later of the date--
    (i) The coverage is denied; or
    (ii) The issuer demonstrates to the applicable State authority (if 
required under applicable State law) that the issuer has sufficient 
financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage.
    (4) A State may apply the 180-day suspension described in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section on a service-area-specific basis.
    (f) Rules for dependents--(1) General rule. If an eligible 
individual elects to enroll in individual health insurance coverage that 
provides coverage for dependents, the issuer may apply a preexisting 
condition exclusion on any dependent who is not an eligible individual.
    (2) Exception for certain children. A child is deemed to be an 
eligible individual if the following conditions are met:
    (i) The child was covered under any creditable coverage within 30 
days of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption (or longer if the 
State provides for a longer special enrollment period than required 
under Sec. 146.117(a)(6) of this subchapter).
    (ii) The child has not had a significant break in coverage.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the requirements of 
this paragraph (f) for certain children:

    Example 1: Individual A had self-only coverage under his employer's 
group health plan for five years. A has two children, ages 11 and 15, 
but never enrolled in family coverage. A leaves his job to become self-
employed, and qualifies as an eligible individual because he is not 
entitled to any continuation coverage, Medicare or Medicaid, and has no 
other health insurance coverage. He applies to Issuer R for coverage in 
the individual market under a policy with family coverage that R makes 
available to eligible individuals. R must sell A the policy, but he may 
refuse coverage to A's children, or may apply a preexisting condition 
exclusion to them if allowed under applicable State law, because they 
did not have prior creditable coverage, and therefore do not qualify as 
eligible individuals.
    Example 2: Individual B was also covered under a group health plan 
for 5 years before losing his job. He originally had coverage only for 
himself and his wife, but 3 months before his employment ended, his wife 
had a baby. B took advantage of the special enrollment period that 
applied, changed to family coverage, and enrolled the baby in the group 
health plan within 20 days. Immediately after losing his job, B applied 
to Issuer R for family coverage. B and his wife qualify as eligible 
individuals, and the baby is deemed to be an eligible individual even 
though she has less than 3 months of creditable coverage. Therefore R 
must make the policy available to all three members of the family, and 
cannot impose any preexisting condition exclusions.

    (g) Clarification of applicability. (1) An issuer in the individual 
market is not required to offer a family coverage option with any policy 
form.
    (2) An issuer offering health insurance coverage only in connection 
with group health plans, or only through one or more bona fide 
associations, or both, is not required to offer that type of coverage in 
the individual market.
    (3) An issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with 
a group health plan is not deemed to be a health insurance issuer 
offering individual health insurance coverage solely because the issuer 
offers a conversion policy.
    (4) This section does not restrict the amount of the premium rates 
that an issuer may charge an individual under State law for health 
insurance coverage provided in the individual market.
    (5) This section does not prevent an issuer offering health 
insurance coverage in the individual market from establishing premium 
discounts or rebates, or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or 
deductibles, in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and 
disease prevention.
    (6) This section does not require issuers to reopen blocks of 
business closed under applicable State law.

Sec. 148.122  Guaranteed renewability of individual health insurance coverage.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to all health insurance 
coverage in the individual market.
    (b) General rules. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, an issuer must renew or continue in force the coverage at the 
option of the individual.
    (2) Medicare eligibility or entitlement is not a basis for 
nonrenewal or termination of an individual's health insurance coverage 
in the individual market.
    (c) Exceptions to renewing coverage. An issuer may nonrenew or 
discontinue health insurance coverage of an individual in the individual 
market based only on one or more of the following:
    (1) Nonpayment of premiums. The individual has failed to pay 
premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the health 
insurance coverage, including any timeliness requirements.
    (2) Fraud. The individual has performed an act or practice that 
constitutes fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material 
fact under the terms of the coverage.
    (3) Termination of plan. The issuer is ceasing to offer coverage in 
the individual market in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section and applicable State law.
    (4) Movement outside the service area. For network plans, the 
individual no longer resides, lives, or works in the service area of the 
issuer, or area for which the issuer is authorized to do business, but 
only if coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any health 
status-related factor of covered individuals.
    (5) Association membership ceases. For coverage made available in 
the individual market only through one or more bona fide associations, 
the individual's membership in the association ceases, but only if the 
coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any health status-
related factor of covered individuals.
    (d) Discontinuing a particular type of coverage. An issuer may 
discontinue offering a particular type of health insurance coverage 
offered in the individual market only if it meets the following 
requirements:
    (1) Provides notice in writing to each individual provided coverage 
of that type of health insurance at least 90 days before the date the 
coverage will be discontinued.
    (2) Offers to each covered individual, on a guaranteed issue basis, 
the option to purchase any other individual health insurance coverage 
currently being offered by the issuer for individuals in that market.
    (3) Acts uniformly without regard to any health status-related 
factor of covered individuals or dependents of covered individuals who 
may become eligible for coverage.
    (e) Discontinuing all coverage. An issuer may discontinue offering 
all health insurance coverage in the individual market in a State only 
if it meets the following requirements.
    (1) Provides notice in writing to the applicable State authority and 
to each individual of the discontinuation at least 180 days before the 
date the coverage will expire.
    (2) Discontinues and does not renew all health insurance policies it 
issues or delivers for issuance in the State in the individual market.
    (3) Acts uniformly without regard to any health status-related 
factor of covered individuals or dependents of covered individuals who 
may become eligible for coverage.
    (f) Prohibition on market reentry. An issuer who elects to 
discontinue offering all health insurance coverage under paragraph (e) 
of this section may not issue coverage in the market and State involved 
during the 5-year period beginning on the date of discontinuation of the 
last coverage not renewed.
    (g) Exception for uniform modification of coverage. An issuer may, 
only at the time of coverage renewal, modify the health insurance 
coverage for a policy form offered in the individual market if the 
modification is consistent with State law and is effective uniformly for 
all individuals with that policy form.
    (h) Application to coverage offered only through associations. In 
the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health 
insurance issuer in the individual market only through one or more 
associations, any reference

[[Page 643]]

in this section to an ``individual'' is deemed to include a reference to 
the association of which the individual is a member.

Sec. 148.124  Certification and disclosure of coverage.

    (a) Applicability--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, this section applies to all issuers of health 
insurance coverage.
    (2) Exception. The provisions of this section do not apply to 
issuers of the following types of coverage:
    (i) Health insurance coverage furnished in connection with a group 
health plan defined in Sec. 144.103 of this subchapter. (These issuers 
are required under Sec. 146.115 of this subchapter to provide a 
certificate of coverage.)
    (ii) Excepted benefits described in Sec. 148.220.
    (iii) Short-term, limited duration coverage defined in Sec. 144.103 
of this subchapter.
    (b) General rules--(1) Individuals for whom a certificate must be 
provided; timing of issuance. A certificate must be provided, without 
charge, for individuals and dependents who are or were covered under an 
individual health insurance policy as follows:
    (i) Issuance of automatic certificates. An automatic certificate 
must be provided within a reasonable time period consistent with State 
law after the individual ceases to be covered under the policy.
    (ii) Any individual upon request. Requests for certificates may be 
made by, or on behalf of, an individual within 24 months after coverage 
ends. For example, an entity that provides coverage to an individual in 
the future may, if authorized by the individual, request a certificate 
of the individual's creditable coverage on behalf of the individual from 
the issuer of the individual's prior coverage. After the request is 
received, an issuer must provide the certificate by the earliest date 
the issuer, acting in a reasonable and prompt fashion, can provide the 
certificate. A certificate must be provided under this paragraph even if 
the individual has previously received a certificate under this 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or an automatic certificate under paragraph 
(a)(l)(i) of this section.
    (2) Form and content of certificate--(i) Written certificate--(A) 
General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this 
section, the issuer must provide the certificate in writing (including 
any form approved by CMS).
    (B) Other permissible forms. No written certificate must be provided 
if all of the following occur:
    (1) An individual is entitled to receive a certificate.
    (2) The individual requests that the certificate be sent to another 
plan or issuer instead of to the individual.
    (3) The plan or issuer that would otherwise receive the certificate 
agrees to accept the information in paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
through means other than a written certificate (for example, by 
telephone).
    (4) The receiving plan or issuer receives the information from the 
sending issuer in the prescribed form within the time periods required 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Required information. The certificate must include the 
following:
    (A) The date the certificate is issued.
    (B) The name of the individual or dependent for whom the certificate 
applies, and any other information necessary for the issuer providing 
the coverage specified in the certificate to identify the individual, 
such as the individual's identification number under the policy and the 
name of the policyholder if the certificate is for (or includes) a 
dependent.
    (C) The name, address, and telephone number of the issuer required 
to provide the certificate.
    (D) The telephone number to call for further information regarding 
the certificate (if different from paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this 
section).
    (E) Either one of the following:
    (1) A statement that the individual has at least 18 months (for this 
purpose, 546 days is deemed to be 18 months) of creditable coverage, 
disregarding days of creditable coverage before a significant break in 
coverage as defined in Sec. 146.113(b)(2)(iii) of this subchapter.

[[Page 644]]

    (2) Both the date the individual first sought coverage, as evidenced 
by a substantially complete application, and the date creditable 
coverage began.
    (F) The date creditable coverage ended, unless the certificate 
indicates that creditable coverage is continuing as of the date of the 
certificate.
    (iii) Periods of coverage under a certificate. If an automatic 
certificate is provided under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the 
period that must be included on the certificate is the last period of 
continuous coverage ending on the date coverage ceased. If an individual 
requests a certificate under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a 
certificate must be provided for each period of continuous coverage 
ending within the 24-month period ending on the date of the request (or 
continuing on the date of the request). A separate certificate may be 
provided for each period of continuous coverage.
    (iv) Single certificate permitted for families. An issuer may 
provide a single certificate for both an individual and the individual's 
dependents if it provides all the required information for each 
individual and dependent, and separately states the information that is 
not identical.
    (v) Model certificate. The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section are satisfied if the issuer provides a certificate in 
accordance with a model certificate as provided by CMS.
    (vi) Excepted benefits; categories of benefits. No certificate is 
required to be furnished with respect to excepted benefits described in 
Sec. 148.220. If excepted benefits are provided concurrently with other 
creditable coverage (so that the coverage does not consist solely of 
excepted benefits), information concerning the benefits may be required 
to be disclosed under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Procedures--(i) Method of delivery. The certificate is required 
to be provided, without charge, to each individual described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section or an entity requesting the certificate 
on behalf of the individual. The certificate may be provided by first-
class mail. If the certificate or certificates are provided to the 
individual and the individual's spouse at the individual's last known 
address, the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) are satisfied with 
respect to all individuals and dependents residing at that address. If a 
dependent's last known address is different than the individual's last 
known address, a separate certificate must be provided to the dependent 
at the dependent's last known address. If separate certificates are 
provided by mail to individuals and dependents who reside at the same 
address, separate mailings of each certificate are not required.
    (ii) Procedure for requesting certificates. An issuer must establish 
a procedure for individuals and dependents to request and receive 
certificates under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) Designated recipients. If an automatic certificate is required 
to be provided under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and the 
individual or dependent entitled to receive the certificate designates 
another individual or entity to receive the certificate, the issuer 
responsible for providing the certificate may provide the certificate to 
the designated party. If a certificate must be provided upon request 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and the individual entitled 
to receive the certificate designates another individual or entity to 
receive the certificate, the issuer responsible for providing the 
certificates must provide the certificate to the designated party.
    (4) Special rules concerning dependent coverage--(i) Reasonable 
efforts. An issuer must use reasonable efforts to determine any 
information needed for a certificate relating to dependent coverage. If 
an automatic certificate must be furnished with respect to a dependent 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, no individual certificate 
must be furnished until the issuer knows (or making reasonable efforts 
should know) of the dependent's cessation of coverage under the policy.
    (ii) Special rules for demonstrating coverage. If a certificate 
furnished by an issuer does not provide the name of any dependent of an 
individual covered by the certificate, the individual may, if necessary, 
use the procedures described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section for 
demonstrating dependent status. An individual may, if necessary, use 
these procedures to demonstrate that a child

[[Page 645]]

was enrolled within 30 days of birth, adoption, or placement for 
adoption, in which case the child would not be subject to a preexisting 
condition exclusion under Sec. 148.120(f)(2).
    (iii) Transition rule for dependent coverage through June 30, 1998--
(A) General rule. An issuer that cannot provide the names of dependents 
(or related coverage information) for purposes of providing a 
certificate of coverage for a dependent may satisfy the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section by providing the name of the 
policyholder and specifying that the type of coverage described in the 
certificate is for dependent coverage (for example, family coverage or 
individual-plus-spouse coverage).
    (B) Certificates provided on request. For purposes of certificates 
provided on the request of, or on behalf of, an individual under 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, an issuer must make reasonable 
efforts to obtain and provide the names of any dependent covered by the 
certificate if the information is requested. If a certificate does not 
include the name of any dependent of an individual covered by the 
certificate, the individual may, if necessary, use the procedures 
described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section for submitting 
documentation to establish that the creditable coverage in the 
certificate applies to the dependent.
    (C) Demonstrating a dependent's creditable coverage. See paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section for special rules to demonstrate dependent 
status.
    (D) Duration. The transitional rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) 
are effective for certifications provided with respect to an event 
occurring before July 1, 1998.
    (5) Optional notice. This paragraph applies to events described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, that occur after September 30, 
1996, but before June 30, 1997. An issuer offering individual health 
insurance coverage is deemed to satisfy paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of 
this section if a notice is provided in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 146.125(e)(3)(ii) through (e)(3)(iv) of this subchapter.
    (c) Disclosure of coverage to a plan, or issuer, electing the 
alternative method of creating coverage--(1) General rule. If an 
individual enrolls in a group health plan and the plan or issuer uses 
the alternative method of determining creditable coverage described in 
Sec. 146.113(c) of this subchapter, the individual provides a 
certificate of coverage under paragraph (b) of this section or 
demonstrates creditable coverage under paragraph (d) of this section, 
and the plan or coverage in which the individual enrolls requests from 
the prior entity, the prior entity must disclose promptly to the 
requesting plan or issuer (``requesting entity'') the information set 
forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Information to be disclosed. The prior entity must identify to 
the requesting entity the categories of benefits under which the 
individual was covered and with respect to which the requesting entity 
is using the alternative method of counting creditable coverage, and the 
requesting entity may identify specific information that the requesting 
entity reasonably needs to determine the individual's creditable 
coverage with respect to any of those categories. The prior entity must 
promptly disclose to the requesting entity the creditable coverage 
information that was requested.
    (3) Charge for providing information. The prior entity furnishing 
the information under paragraph (c)(2) of this section may charge the 
requesting entity for the reasonable cost of disclosing the information.
    (d) Ability of an individual to demonstrate creditable coverage and 
waiting period information--(1) General rule. Individuals may establish 
creditable coverage through means other than certificates. If the 
accuracy of a certificate is contested or a certificate is unavailable 
when needed by the individual, the individual has the right to 
demonstrate creditable coverage (and waiting or affiliation periods) 
through the presentation of documents or other means. For example, the 
individual may make a demonstration if one of the following occurs:
    (i) An entity has failed to provide a certificate within the 
required time period.

[[Page 646]]

    (ii) The individual has creditable coverage but an entity may not be 
required to provide a certificate of the coverage.
    (iii) The coverage is for a period before July 1, 1996.
    (iv) The individual has an urgent medical condition that 
necessitates a determination before the individual can deliver a 
certificate to the plan.
    (v) The individual lost a certificate that the individual had 
previously received and is unable to obtain another certificate.
    (2) Evidence of creditable coverage--(i) Consideration of evidence. 
An issuer must take into account all information that it obtains or that 
is presented on behalf of an individual to make a determination, based 
on the relevant facts and circumstances, whether or not an individual 
has 18 months of creditable coverage. An issuer must treat the 
individual as having furnished a certificate if the individual attests 
to the period of creditable coverage, the individual presents relevant 
corroborating evidence of some creditable coverage during the period, 
and the individual cooperates with the issuer's efforts to verify the 
individual's coverage. For this purpose, cooperation includes providing 
(upon the issuer's request) a written authorization for the issuer to 
request a certificate on behalf of the individual, and cooperating in 
efforts to determine the validity of the corroborating evidence and the 
dates of creditable coverage. While an issuer may refuse to credit 
coverage if the individual fails to cooperate with the issuer's efforts 
to verify coverage, the issuer may not consider an individual's 
inability to obtain a certificate to be evidence of the absence of 
creditable coverage.
    (ii) Documents. Documents that may establish creditable coverage 
(and waiting periods or affiliation periods) in the absence of a 
certificate include explanations of benefit claims (EOB) or other 
correspondence from a plan or issuer indicating coverage, pay stubs 
showing a payroll deduction for health coverage, a health insurance 
identification card, a certificate of coverage under a group health 
policy, records from medical care providers indicating health coverage, 
third party statements verifying periods of coverage, and any other 
relevant documents that evidence periods of health coverage.
    (iii) Other evidence. Creditable coverage (and waiting period or 
affiliation period information) may be established through means other 
than documentation, such as by a telephone call from the issuer to a 
third party verifying creditable coverage.
    (3) Demonstrating dependent status. If, in the course of providing 
evidence (including a certificate) of creditable coverage, an individual 
is required to demonstrate dependent status, the issuer must treat the 
individual as having furnished a certificate showing the dependent 
status if the individual attests to the dependency and the period of the 
status and the individual cooperates with the issuer's efforts to verify 
the dependent status.

Sec. 148.126  Determination of an eligible individual.

    (a) General rule. Each issuer offering health insurance coverage in 
the individual market is responsible for determining whether an 
applicant for coverage is an eligible individual as defined in Sec. 
148.103.
    (b) Specific requirements. (1) The issuer must exercise reasonable 
diligence in making this determination.
    (2) The issuer must promptly determine whether an applicant is an 
eligible individual.
    (3) If an issuer determines that an individual is an eligible 
individual, the issuer must promptly issue a policy to that individual.
    (c) Insufficient information--(1) General rule. If the information 
presented in or with an application is substantially insufficient for 
the issuer to make the determination described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, the issuer may immediately request additional information 
from the individual, and must act promptly to make its determination 
after receipt of the requested information
    (2) Failure to provide a certification of creditable coverage. If an 
entity fails to provide the certificate that is required

[[Page 647]]

under this part or part 146 of this subchapter to the applicant, the 
issuer is subject to the procedures set forth in Sec. 148.124(d)(1) 
concerning an individual's right to demonstrate creditable coverage.

requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 148.128  State flexibility in individual market reforms--alternative 
mechanisms.

    (a) Waiver of requirements. The requirements of Sec. 148.120, which 
set forth Federal requirements for guaranteed availability in the 
individual market, do not apply in a State that implements an acceptable 
alternative mechanism in accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) The alternative mechanism meets the following conditions:
    (i) Offers health insurance coverage to all eligible individuals.
    (ii) Prohibits imposing preexisting condition exclusions and 
affiliation periods for coverage of an eligible individual.
    (iii) Offers an eligible individual a choice of coverage that 
includes at least one policy form of coverage that is comparable to 
either one of the following:
    (A) Comprehensive coverage offered in the individual market in the 
State.
    (B) A standard option of coverage available under the group or 
individual health insurance laws of the State.
    (2) The State is implementing one of the following provisions 
relating to risk:
    (i) One of the following model acts, as adopted by the NAIC on June 
3, 1996, but only if the model has been revised in State regulations to 
meet all of the requirements of this part and title 27 of the PHS Act.
    (A) The Small Employer and Individual Health Insurance Availability 
Model Act to the extent it applies to individual health insurance 
coverage.
    (B) The Individual Health Insurance Portability Model Act.
    (ii) A qualified high risk pool, which, for purposes of this 
section, is a high risk pool that meets the following conditions:
    (A) Provides to all eligible individuals health insurance coverage 
(or comparable coverage) that does not impose any preexisting condition 
exclusion or affiliation periods for coverage of an eligible individual.
    (B) Provides for premium rates and covered benefits for the coverage 
consistent with standards included in the NAIC Model Health Plan for 
Uninsurable Individuals Act (as in effect as of August 21, 1996), but 
only if the model has been revised in State regulations to meet all of 
the requirements of this part and title 27 of the PHS Act.
    (iii) One of the following mechanisms:
    (A) Any other mechanism that provides for risk adjustment, risk 
spreading, or a risk-spreading mechanism (among issuers or policies of 
an issuer) or otherwise provides for some financial subsidization for 
eligible individuals, including through assistance to participating 
issuers.
    (B) A mechanism that provides a choice for each eligible individual 
of all individual health insurance coverage otherwise available.
    (b) Permissible forms of mechanisms. A private or public individual 
health insurance mechanism (such as a health insurance coverage pool or 
program, a mandatory group conversion policy, guaranteed issue of one or 
more plans of individual health insurance coverage, or open enrollment 
by one or more health insurance issuers), or combination of these 
mechanisms, that is designed to provide access to health benefits for 
individuals in the individual market in the State, in accordance with 
this section, may constitute an acceptable alternative mechanism.
    (c) Establishing an acceptable alternative mechanism--transition 
rules. CMS presumes a State to be implementing an acceptable alternative 
mechanism as of July 1, 1997 if the following conditions are met:
    (1) By not later than April 1, 1997, as evidenced by a postmark 
date, or other such date, the chief executive officer of the State takes 
the following actions:

[[Page 648]]

    (i) Notifies CMS that the State has enacted or intends to enact by 
not later than January 1, 1998 (unless it is a State described in 
paragraph (d) of this section), any legislation necessary to provide for 
the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an 
acceptable alternative mechanism as of January 1, 1998.
    (ii) Provides CMS with the information necessary to review the 
mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation).
    (2) CMS has not made a determination, in accordance with the 
procedure in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, that the State will not 
be implementing a mechanism reasonably designed to be an acceptable 
alternative mechanism as of January 1, 1998.
    (d) Delay permitted for certain States. If a State notifies CMS that 
its legislature is not meeting in a regular session between August 21, 
1996 and August 20, 1997, CMS continues to presume until July 1, 1998 
that the State is implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism, if 
the chief executive officer of the State takes the following actions:
    (1) Notifies CMS by April 1, 1997, that the State intends to submit 
an alternative mechanism and intends to enact any necessary legislation 
to provide for the implementation of an acceptable alternative mechanism 
as of July 1, 1998.
    (2) Notifies CMS by April 1, 1998, that the State has enacted any 
necessary legislation to provide for the implementation of an acceptable 
alternative mechanism as of July 1, 1998.
    (3) Provides CMS with the information necessary to review the 
mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation).
    (e) Submitting an alternative mechanism after April 1, 1997--(1) 
Notice with information. A State that wishes to implement an acceptable 
alternative mechanism must take the following actions:
    (i) Notify CMS that it has enacted legislation necessary to provide 
for the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an 
acceptable alternative mechanism, and
    (ii) Provide CMS with the information necessary for CMS to review 
the mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation).
    (2) An acceptable alternative mechanism. If the State takes the 
actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the mechanism is 
considered to be an acceptable alternative mechanism unless CMS makes a 
preliminary determination (under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section), 
within the review period (defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), 
that the mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism.
    (3) Review period--(i) General. The review period begins on the date 
the State's notice and information are received by CMS, and ends 90 days 
later, not counting any days during which the review period is suspended 
under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Suspension of review period. During any review period, if CMS 
notifies the State of the need for additional information or further 
discussion on its submission, CMS suspends the review period until the 
State provides the necessary information.
    (4) Determination by CMS--(i) Preliminary determination. If CMS 
finds after reviewing the submitted information, and after consultation 
with the chief executive officer of the State and the chief insurance 
regulatory official of the State, that the mechanism is not an 
acceptable alternative mechanism, CMS takes the following actions:
    (A) Notifies the State, in writing, of the preliminary 
determination.
    (B) Informs the State that if it fails to implement an acceptable 
alternative mechanism, the Federal guaranteed availability provisions of 
Sec. 148.120 will take effect.
    (C) Permits the State a reasonable opportunity to modify the 
mechanism (or to adopt another mechanism).
    (ii) Final determination. If, after providing notice and a 
reasonable opportunity for the State to modify its mechanism, CMS makes 
a final determination that the design of the State's alternative 
mechanism is not acceptable or that the State is not substantially 
enforcing an acceptable alternative mechanism, CMS notifies the State in 
writing of the following:
    (A) CMS's final determination.
    (B) That the requirements of Sec. 148.120 concerning guaranteed 
availability

[[Page 649]]

apply to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in 
the State as of a date specified in the notice from CMS.
    (iii) State request for early notice. A State may request that CMS 
notify the State before the end of the review period if CMS is not 
making a preliminary determination.
    (5) Effective date. If CMS does not make a preliminary determination 
within the review period, the acceptable alternative mechanism is 
effective 90 days after the end of the 90-day review period described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
    (f) Continued application. A State alternative mechanism may 
continue to be presumed to be acceptable, if the State provides 
information to CMS that meets the following requirements:
    (1) If the State makes a significant change to its alternative 
mechanism, it provides the information before making a change.
    (2) Every 3 years from the later of implementing the alternative 
mechanism or implementing a significant change, it provides CMS with 
information.
    (g) Review criteria. CMS reviews each State's submission to 
determine whether it addresses all of the following requirements:
    (1) Is the mechanism reasonably designed to provide all eligible 
individuals with a choice of health insurance coverage?
    (2) Does the choice offered to eligible individuals include at least 
one policy form that meets one of the following requirements?
    (i) Is the policy form comparable to comprehensive health insurance 
coverage offered in the individual market in the State?
    (ii) Is the policy form comparable to a standard option of coverage 
available under the group or individual health insurance laws of the 
State?
    (3) Does the mechanism prohibit preexisting condition exclusions for 
all eligible individuals?
    (4) Is the State implementing one of the following:
    (i) The NAIC Small Employer and Individual Health Insurance 
Availability Model Act (Availability Model), adopted on June 3, 1996, 
revised to reflect HIPAA requirements.
    (ii) The Individual Health Insurance Portability Model Act 
(Portability Model), adopted on June 3, 1996, revised to reflect HIPAA 
requirements.
    (iii) A qualified high-risk pool that provides eligible individuals 
health insurance or comparable coverage without a preexisting condition 
exclusion, and with premiums and benefits consistent with the NAIC Model 
Health Plan for Uninsurable Individuals Act (as in effect August 21, 
1996), revised to reflect HIPAA requirements.
    (iv) A mechanism that provides for risk spreading or provides 
eligible individuals with a choice of all available individual health 
insurance coverage.
    (5) Has the State enacted all legislation necessary for implementing 
the alternative mechanism?
    (6) If the State has not enacted all legislation necessary for 
implementing the alternative mechanism, will the necessary legislation 
be enacted by January 1, 1998?
    (h) Limitation of CMS's authority. CMS does not make a preliminary 
or final determination on any basis other than that a mechanism is not 
considered an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not being 
implemented.

<R04>
               Subpart C--Requirements Related to Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 148.170  Standards relating to benefits for mothers and newborns.

    (a) Hospital length of stay--(1) General rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section, an issuer offering health insurance 
coverage in the individual market that provides benefits for a hospital 
length of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or her newborn 
may not restrict benefits for the stay to less than--
    (i) 48 hours following a vaginal delivery; or
    (ii) 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section.

[[Page 650]]

    (2) When stay begins--(i) Delivery in a hospital. If delivery occurs 
in a hospital, the hospital length of stay for the mother or newborn 
child begins at the time of delivery (or in the case of multiple births, 
at the time of the last delivery).
    (ii) Delivery outside a hospital. If delivery occurs outside a 
hospital, the hospital length of stay begins at the time the mother or 
newborn is admitted as a hospital inpatient in connection with 
childbirth. The determination of whether an admission is in connection 
with childbirth is a medical decision to be made by the attending 
provider.
    (3) Examples. The rules of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section are illustrated by the following examples. In each example, the 
issuer provides benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with 
childbirth and is subject to the requirements of this section, as 
follows:

    Example 1. (i) A pregnant woman covered under a policy issued in the 
individual market goes into labor and is admitted to the hospital at 10 
p.m. on June 11. She gives birth by vaginal delivery at 6 a.m. on June 
12.
    (ii) In this Example 1, the 48-hour period described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section ends at 6 a.m. on June 14.
    Example 2. (i) A woman covered under a policy issued in the 
individual market gives birth at home by vaginal delivery. After the 
delivery, the woman begins bleeding excessively in connection with the 
childbirth and is admitted to the hospital for treatment of the 
excessive bleeding at 7 p.m. on October 1.
    (ii) In this Example 2, the 48-hour period described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section ends at 7 p.m. on October 3.
    Example 3. (i) A woman covered under a policy issued in the 
individual market gives birth by vaginal delivery at home. The child 
later develops pneumonia and is admitted to the hospital. The attending 
provider determines that the admission is not in connection with 
childbirth.
    (ii) In this Example 3, the hospital length-of-stay requirements of 
this section do not apply to the child's admission to the hospital 
because the admission is not in connection with childbirth.

    (4) Authorization not required--(i) In general. An issuer may not 
require that a physician or other health care provider obtain 
authorization from the issuer for prescribing the hospital length of 
stay required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (See also 
paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(3) of this section for rules and examples 
regarding other authorization and certain notice requirements.)
    (ii) Example. The rule of this paragraph (a)(4) is illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) In the case of a delivery by cesarean section, an 
issuer subject to the requirements of this section automatically 
provides benefits for any hospital length of stay of up to 72 hours. For 
any longer stay, the issuer requires an attending provider to complete a 
certificate of medical necessity. The issuer then makes a determination, 
based on the certificate of medical necessity, whether a longer stay is 
medically necessary.
    (ii) In this Example, the requirement that an attending provider 
complete a certificate of medical necessity to obtain authorization for 
the period between 72 hours and 96 hours following a delivery by 
cesarean section is prohibited by this paragraph (a)(4).

    (5) Exceptions--(i) Discharge of mother. If a decision to discharge 
a mother earlier than the period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is made by an attending provider, in consultation with the 
mother, the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not 
apply for any period after the discharge.
    (ii) Discharge of newborn. If a decision to discharge a newborn 
child earlier than the period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is made by an attending provider, in consultation with the 
mother (or the newborn's authorized representative), the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply for any period after the 
discharge.
    (iii) Attending provider defined. For purposes of this section, 
attending provider means an individual who is licensed under applicable 
State law to provide maternity or pediatric care and who is directly 
responsible for providing maternity or pediatric care to a mother or 
newborn child.
    (iv) Example. The rules of this paragraph (a)(5) are illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) A pregnant woman covered under a policy offered by an 
issuer subject to the requirements of this section goes into labor and 
is admitted to a hospital. She gives birth by cesarean section. On the 
third day after the delivery, the attending provider for

[[Page 651]]

the mother consults with the mother, and the attending provider for the 
newborn consults with the mother regarding the newborn. The attending 
providers authorize the early discharge of both the mother and the 
newborn. Both are discharged approximately 72 hours after the delivery. 
The issuer pays for the 72-hour hospital stays.
    (ii) In this Example, the requirements of this paragraph (a) have 
been satisfied with respect to the mother and the newborn. If either is 
readmitted, the hospital stay for the readmission is not subject to this 
section.

    (b) Prohibitions--(1) With respect to mothers--(i) In general. An 
issuer may not--
    (A) Deny a mother or her newborn child eligibility or continued 
eligibility to enroll in or renew coverage solely to avoid the 
requirements of this section; or
    (B) Provide payments (including payments-in-kind) or rebates to a 
mother to encourage her to accept less than the minimum protections 
available under this section.
    (ii) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b)(1) are illustrated by 
the following examples. In each example, the issuer is subject to the 
requirements of this section, as follows:

    Example 1. (i) An issuer provides benefits for at least a 48-hour 
hospital length of stay following a vaginal delivery. If a mother and 
newborn covered under a policy issued in the individual market are 
discharged within 24 hours after the delivery, the issuer will waive the 
copayment and deductible.
    (ii) In this Example 1, because waiver of the copayment and 
deductible is in the nature of a rebate that the mother would not 
receive if she and her newborn remained in the hospital, it is 
prohibited by this paragraph (b)(1). (In addition, the issuer violates 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section because, in effect, no copayment or 
deductible is required for the first portion of the stay and a double 
copayment and a deductible are required for the second portion of the 
stay.)
    Example 2. (i) An issuer provides benefits for at least a 48-hour 
hospital length of stay following a vaginal delivery. In the event that 
a mother and her newborn are discharged earlier than 48 hours and the 
discharges occur after consultation with the mother in accordance with 
the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the issuer 
provides for a follow-up visit by a nurse within 48 hours after the 
discharges to provide certain services that the mother and her newborn 
would otherwise receive in the hospital.
    (ii) In this Example 2, because the follow-up visit does not provide 
any services beyond what the mother and her newborn would receive in the 
hospital, coverage for the follow-up visit is not prohibited by this 
paragraph (b)(1).

    (2) With respect to benefit restrictions--(i) In general. Subject to 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an issuer may not restrict the 
benefits for any portion of a hospital length of stay required under 
paragraph (a) of this section in a manner that is less favorable than 
the benefits provided for any preceding portion of the stay.
    (ii) Example. The rules of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) An issuer subject to the requirements of this section 
provides benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with 
childbirth. In the case of a delivery by cesarean section, the issuer 
automatically pays for the first 48 hours. With respect to each 
succeeding 24-hour period, the covered individual must call the issuer 
to obtain precertification from a utilization reviewer, who determines 
if an additional 24-hour period is medically necessary. If this approval 
is not obtained, the issuer will not provide benefits for any succeeding 
24-hour period.
    (ii) In this Example, the requirement to obtain precertification for 
the two 24-hour periods immediately following the initial 48-hour stay 
is prohibited by this paragraph (b)(2) because benefits for the latter 
part of the stay are restricted in a manner that is less favorable than 
benefits for a preceding portion of the stay. (However, this section 
does not prohibit an issuer from requiring precertification for any 
period after the first 96 hours.) In addition, if the issuer's 
utilization reviewer denied any mother or her newborn benefits within 
the 96-hour stay, the issuer would also violate paragraph (a) of this 
section.

    (3) With respect to attending providers. An issuer may not directly 
or indirectly--
    (i) Penalize (for example, take disciplinary action against or 
retaliate against), or otherwise reduce or limit the compensation of, an 
attending provider because the provider furnished care to a covered 
individual in accordance with this section; or
    (ii) Provide monetary or other incentives to an attending provider 
to induce the provider to furnish care to a covered individual in a 
manner inconsistent with this section, including providing any incentive 
that could induce

[[Page 652]]

an attending provider to discharge a mother or newborn earlier than 48 
hours (or 96 hours) after delivery.
    (c) Construction. With respect to this section, the following rules 
of construction apply:
    (1) Hospital stays not mandatory. This section does not require a 
mother to--
    (i) Give birth in a hospital; or
    (ii) Stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time following the 
birth of her child.
    (2) Hospital stay benefits not mandated. This section does not apply 
to any issuer that does not provide benefits for hospital lengths of 
stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or her newborn child.
    (3) Cost-sharing rules--(i) In general. This section does not 
prevent an issuer from imposing deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-
sharing in relation to benefits for hospital lengths of stay in 
connection with childbirth for a mother or a newborn under the coverage, 
except that the coinsurance or other cost-sharing for any portion of the 
hospital length of stay required under paragraph (a) of this section may 
not be greater than that for any preceding portion of the stay.
    (ii) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c)(3) are illustrated by 
the following examples. In each example, the issuer is subject to the 
requirements of this section, as follows:

    Example 1. (i) An issuer provides benefits for at least a 48-hour 
hospital length of stay in connection with vaginal deliveries. The 
issuer covers 80 percent of the cost of the stay for the first 24-hour 
period and 50 percent of the cost of the stay for the second 24-hour 
period. Thus, the coinsurance paid by the patient increases from 20 
percent to 50 percent after 24 hours.
    (ii) In this Example 1, the issuer violates the rules of this 
paragraph (c)(3) because coinsurance for the second 24-hour period of 
the 48-hour stay is greater than that for the preceding portion of the 
stay. (In addition, the issuer also violates the similar rule in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.)
    Example 2. (i) An issuer generally covers 70 percent of the cost of 
a hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth. However, the 
issuer will cover 80 percent of the cost of the stay if the covered 
individual notifies the issuer of the pregnancy in advance of admission 
and uses whatever hospital the issuer may designate.
    (ii) In this Example 2, the issuer does not violate the rules of 
this paragraph (c)(3) because the level of benefits provided (70 percent 
or 80 percent) is consistent throughout the 48-hour (or 96-hour) 
hospital length of stay required under paragraph (a) of this section. 
(In addition, the issuer does not violate the rules in paragraph (a)(4) 
or paragraph (b)(2) of this section.)

    (4) Compensation of attending provider. This section does not 
prevent an issuer from negotiating with an attending provider the level 
and type of compensation for care furnished in accordance with this 
section (including paragraph (b) of this section).
    (5) Applicability. This section applies to all health insurance 
coverage issued in the individual market, and is not limited in its 
application to coverage that is provided to eligible individuals as 
defined in section 2741(b) of the PHS Act.
    (d) Notice requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of 
this section, an issuer offering health insurance in the individual 
market must meet the following requirements with respect to benefits for 
hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth:
    (1) Required statement. The insurance contract must disclose 
information that notifies covered individuals of their rights under this 
section.
    (2) Disclosure notice. To meet the disclosure requirement set forth 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the following disclosure notice 
must be used:

 Statement of Rights Under the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection 
                                   Act

    Under federal law, health insurance issuers generally may not 
restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with 
childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours 
following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery 
by cesarean section. However, the issuer may pay for a shorter stay if 
the attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or 
physician assistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the 
mother or newborn earlier.
    Also, under federal law, issuers may not set the level of benefits 
or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour (or 96-
hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or 
newborn than any earlier portion of the stay.
    In addition, an issuer may not, under federal law, require that a 
physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for 
prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours

[[Page 653]]

(or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, or to 
reduce your out-of-pocket costs, you may be required to obtain 
precertification. For information on precertification, contact your 
issuer.

    (3) Timing of disclosure. The disclosure notice in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section shall be furnished to the covered individuals in the 
form of a copy of the contract, or a rider (or equivalent amendment to 
the contract), not later than March 1, 1999.
    (4) Exception. The requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply 
with respect to coverage regulated under a State law described in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Applicability in certain States--(1) Health insurance coverage. 
The requirements of section 2751 of the PHS Act and this section do not 
apply with respect to health insurance coverage in the individual market 
if there is a State law regulating the coverage that meets any of the 
following criteria:
    (i) The State law requires the coverage to provide for at least a 
48-hour hospital length of stay following a vaginal delivery and at 
least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a delivery by cesarean 
section.
    (ii) The State law requires the coverage to provide for maternity 
and pediatric care in accordance with guidelines established by the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, or any other established professional medical 
association.
    (iii) The State law requires, in connection with the coverage for 
maternity care, that the hospital length of stay for such care is left 
to the decision of (or is required to be made by) the attending provider 
in consultation with the mother. State laws that require the decision to

<R05>
Sec. 148.210  Preemption.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section describes the effect of sections 2741 
through 2763 and 2791 of the PHS Act on a State's authority to regulate 
health insurance issuers in the individual market. This section makes 
clear that States remain subject to section 514 of ERISA, which 
generally preempts State law that relates to ERISA-covered plans.
    (2) Sections 2741 through 2763 and 2791 of the PHS Act cannot be 
construed to affect or modify the provisions of section 514 of ERISA.
    (b) Regulation of insurance issuers. The individual market rules of 
this part do not prevent a State law from establishing, implementing, or 
continuing in effect standards or requirements unless the standards or 
requirements prevent the application of a requirement of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 148.220  Excepted benefits.

    The requirements of this part do not apply to individual health 
insurance coverage in relation to its provision of the benefits

[[Page 654]]

    (7) Credit-only insurance (for example, mortgage insurance).
    (8) Coverage for on-site medical clinics.
    (b) Other excepted benefits. The requirements of this part do not 
apply to individual health insurance coverage described in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section if the benefits are provided under 
a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance. These benefits 
include the following:
    (1) Limited scope dental or vision benefits. These benefits are 
dental or vision benefits that are limited in scope to a narrow range or 
type of benefits that are generally excluded from benefit packages that 
combine hospital, medical, and surgical benefits.
    (2) Long-term care benefits. These benefits are benefits that are 
either--
    (i) Subject to State long-term care insurance laws;
    (ii) For qualified long-term care insurance services, as defined in

<R04>
 Subpart E--Grants to States for Operation of Qualified High Risk Pools

    Source: 68 FR 23414, May 2, 2003, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 148.306  Basis and scope.

    This subpart implements section 2745 of the Public Health Service 
Act (the PHS Act). It provides for grants to States that have qualified 
high risk pools that meet the specific requirements described in Sec. 
148.310. It also provides specific instructions on how to apply for the 
grants and outlines the grant review and grant award processes.


<R05>
Sec. 148.308  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    CMS stands for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
    Loss means the difference between expenses incurred by a qualified 
high risk pool, including payment of claims and administrative expenses, 
and the premiums collected by the pool.
    Qualified high risk pool means a high risk pool that meets the 
conditions described in Sec. 148.128(a)(2)(ii):
    (1) It provides to all eligible individuals, as defined in Sec. 
148.103, health insurance coverage (or comparable coverage) that does 
not impose any preexisting condition exclusion or affiliation periods 
for coverage of an eligible individual; and
    (2) Provides for premium rates and covered benefits for the coverage 
consistent with the standards included in the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Model Health Plan for Uninsurable 
Individuals Act (as in effect as of August 21, 1996) but only if the 
model has been revised in State regulations to meet all of the 
requirements of this part and title 27 of the PHS Act.
    Standard risk rate means a rate developed by a State using 
reasonable actuarial techniques and taking into account the premium 
rates charged by other insurers offering health insurance coverage to 
individuals in the same geographical service area to which the rate 
applies. The standard

[[Page 655]]

rate may be adjusted based upon age, sex, and geographical location.


<R05>
Sec. 148.310  Eligibility requirements for a grant.

    A State must meet all of the following requirements to be eligible 
for a grant:
    (a) The State has a qualified high risk pool as defined in Sec. 
148.308.
    (b) The pool restricts premiums charged under the pool to no more 
than 150 percent of the premium for applicable standard risk rates for 
the State.
    (c) The pool offers a choice of two or more coverage options through 
the pool.
    (d) The pool has in effect a mechanism reasonably designed to ensure 
continued funding of losses incurred by the State after the end of 
fiscal year 2004 in connection with the operation of the pool.
    (e) The pool has incurred a loss in a period described in Sec. 
148.314.


<R05>
Sec. 148.312  Amount of grant payment.

    (a) An eligible State may receive a grant to fund up to 50 percent 
of the losses incurred in the operation of its qualified high risk pool 
during the period for which it is applying.
    (b) Funds will be allocated to each eligible State in accordance 
with the following formula:
    (1) The number of uninsured individuals is calculated for each 
eligible State by taking a 3-year average of the number of uninsured 
individuals in that State in the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the 
Census Bureau. For grants based upon State fiscal years 2002 and 2003, a 
3-year average will be calculated using numbers available as of May 1, 
2003. For grants based upon State fiscal year 2004, a 3-year average 
will be calculated using numbers available as of March 1, 2005. 
Calculation of the State 3-year average will be done by the Census 
Bureau and provided to CMS.
    (2) Based upon the CPS numbers, the State's percentage of the total 
uninsured population of eligible States is calculated and then 
multiplied by $40 million to determine the State's maximum allotment for 
the fiscal year in question. The following example illustrates the 
formula in paragraph (b):
    (i) The most current 3-year average of uninsured individuals in 
State A is one million, and the 3-year average of uninsured individuals 
for all eligible States is 10 million. State A has 10 percent of the 
uninsured population of the eligible States.
    (ii) Under this example, State A's allotment would be 10 percent of 
$40 million, or $4 million, for the fiscal year in question.
    (c) The amount awarded to each eligible State will be the lesser of 
the 50 percent of losses incurred by its qualified risk pool for the 
fiscal year in question or its allotment under the formula.


<R05>
Sec. 148.314  Periods during which eligible States may apply for a grant.

    (a) General Rule. A State that meets the eligibility requirements in 
Sec. 148.310 may apply for a grant to fund losses that were incurred 
during the State's fiscal year 2002, 2003, or 2004 in connection with 
the operation of its qualified high risk pool. A State may apply for 
losses incurred in a partial fiscal year if a partial year audit is 
done.
    (b) Maximum number of grants. An eligible State may only be awarded 
a maximum of two grants, with one grant per fiscal year. A grant for a 
partial fiscal year counts as a full grant.
    (c) Deadline for submitting grant applications. The deadlines for 
submitting grant applications are stated in Sec. 148.316(d).
    (d) Initial distribution of grant funds. States that meet all of the 
eligibility requirements in Sec. 148.310 and submit timely requests in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section will receive an initial 
distribution of grant funds using the following methodology:
    (1) Initial grant applications submitted for losses incurred in 
State fiscal year 2002 (hereafter referred to as 02 States). Initial 
grants to States that submit an application for losses incurred in State 
fiscal year 2002 will be funded with Federal fiscal year 2003 funds.
    (2) Initial grant applications submitted for losses incurred in 
State fiscal year 2003 (hereafter referred to as 03 States). Initial 
grants to States that did not submit an application for losses in State 
fiscal year 2002 (or submitted an application but did not qualify) and 
first qualified

[[Page 656]]

for a grant for losses incurred in State fiscal year 2003 will be funded 
with Federal fiscal year 2003 funds.
    (3) Initial grant allocations. Initial grant allocations will be 
determined by taking all grant applications described in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (2) of this section, and allocating in accordance with Sec. 
148.312.
    (4) Other applications. All other grants will be funded in the first 
instance with Federal fiscal year 2004 funds.
    (e) Reallocation of funds. The initial grants to the 02 States and 
the 03 States will come from the Federal fiscal year 2003 funds. After 
the deadline for 02 grants, the Department will determine how many 
States have submitted applications for grants. The Department will then 
estimate, based on contacts with other States, how many requests are 
likely to be received from 03 States. The Department will make an 
initial allotment for 02 States based on these estimates. The Department 
will reserve some of the Federal fiscal year 2003 funds after the 02 
States grant requests have been received in anticipation of requests 
being made by 03 States. The Department will hold in reserves adequate 
funds to provide full allotments to these States. If there are excess 
reserves (that is, the Department withholds more money than was 
necessary to provide grants to the 03 States), the excess funds will be 
proportionally redistributed to the 02 States and the 03 States, but not 
to exceed 50 percent of losses incurred by the States. The size of the 
first year grants will be increased retroactively for these States. 
Similarly, the Department will reserve some of the Federal fiscal year 
2004 money to fund the second year grants for 02 and 03 States and the 
first year grants for the 04 States (that is, States that initially 
qualify based upon losses incurred in their fiscal year 2004).


<R05>
Sec. 148.316  Grant application instructions.

    (a) Application package. The individual States must compile an 
application package that documents that it has met the requirements for

<R05>
Sec. 148.318  Grant application review.

    (a) Executive Order 12372. This grant program is not listed by the 
Secretary under Sec. 100.3 of this title, and therefore the grant 
program is not subject to review by States under part 100 of this title, 
which implements Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of 
Federal Programs'' (see part 100 of this title).
    (b) Review team. A team consisting of staff from CMS and the 
Department of Health and Human Services will review all applications. 
The team will meet as necessary on an ongoing basis as applications are 
received.
    (c) Eligibility criteria. To be eligible for a grant, a State must 
submit sufficient documentation that its high risk pool meets the 
eligibility requirements described in Sec. 148.310. A State must include 
sufficient documentation of the losses incurred in the operation of the 
qualified high risk pool in the period for when it is applying.
    (d) Review criteria. If the review team determines that a State 
meets the eligibility requirements described in Sec. 148.310, the review 
team will use the following additional criteria in reviewing the 
applications:
    (1) Documentation of expenses incurred during operation of the 
qualified high risk pool. The losses and expenses incurred in the 
operation of a State's pool are sufficiently documented.
    (2) Funding mechanism. The State has outlined funding sources, such 
as assessments and State general revenues, which can cover the projected 
costs and are reasonably designed to ensure continued funding of losses 
a State incurs in connection with the operation of the qualified high 
risk pool after fiscal year 2004.


<R05>
Sec. 148.320  Grant awards.

    (a) Notification and award letter. (1) Each State applicant will be

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 150.101  Basis and scope.

    (a) Basis. CMS's enforcement authority under sections 2722 and 2761 
of the PHS Act and its rulemaking authority under section 2792 of the 
PHS Act provide the basis for issuing regulations under this part 150.
    (b) Scope--(1) Enforcement with respect to group heath plans. The 
provisions of title XXVII of the PHS Act that apply to group health 
plans that are non-Federal governmental plans are enforced by CMS using 
the procedures described in Sec. 150.301 et seq.
    (2) Enforcement with respect to health insurance issuers. The States 
have primary enforcement authority with respect to the requirements of 
title XXVII of the PHS Act that apply to health insurance issuers 
offering coverage in the group or individual health insurance market. If 
CMS determines under subpart B of this part that a State is not 
substantially enforcing title XXVII of the PHS Act, including the 
implementing regulations in part 146 and part 148 of this subchapter, 
CMS enforces them under subpart C of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 150.103  Definitions.

    The definitions that appear in part 144 of this subchapter apply to 
this part 150, unless stated otherwise. As used in this part:
    Amendment, endorsement, or rider means a document that modifies or 
changes the terms or benefits of an individual policy, group policy, or 
certificate of insurance.
    Application means a signed statement of facts by a potential insured 
that an issuer uses as a basis for its decision whether, and on what 
basis to insure an individual, or to issue a certificate of insurance, 
or that a non-Federal governmental health plan uses as a basis for a 
decision whether to enroll an individual under the plan.
    Certificate of insurance means the document issued to a person or 
entity covered under an insurance policy issued to a group health plan 
or an association or trust that summarizes the benefits and principal 
provisions of the policy.
    Complaint means any expression, written or oral, indicating a 
potential denial of any right or protection contained in HIPAA 
requirements (whether ultimately justified or not) by an individual, a 
personal representative or other entity acting on behalf of an 
individual, or any entity that believes such a right is being or has 
been denied an individual.
    Group health insurance policy or group policy means the legal 
document or contract issued by an issuer to a plan sponsor with respect 
to a group health plan (including a plan that is a non-Federal 
governmental plan) that contains the conditions and terms of the 
insurance that covers the group.
    HIPAA requirements means the requirements of title XXVII of the PHS 
Act and its implementing regulations in parts 146 and 148 of this 
subchapter.
    Individual health insurance policy or individual policy means the 
legal document or contract issued by the issuer to an individual that 
contains the conditions and terms of the insurance. Any association or 
trust arrangement that is not a group health plan as defined in Sec. 
144.103 of this subchapter or does not provide coverage in connection 
with one or more group health plans is individual coverage subject to 
the requirements of part 148 of this subchapter. The term ``individual 
health insurance policy'' includes a policy that is--
    (1) Issued to an association that makes coverage available to 
individuals other than in connection with one or more group health 
plans; or
    (2) Administered, or placed in a trust, and is not sold in 
connection with a group health plan subject to the provisions of part 
146 of this subchapter.

[[Page 660]]

    Plan document means the legal document that provides the terms of 
the plan to individuals covered under a group health plan, such as a 
non-Federal governmental health plan.
    State law means all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other 
State action having the effect of law, of any State as defined in Sec. 
144.103 of this subchapter. A law of the United States applicable to the 
District of Columbia is treated as a State law rather than a law of the 
United States.

           Failing to Substantially Enforce HIPAA Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 150.201  State enforcement.

    Except as provided in subpart C of this part, each State enforces 
HIPAA requirements with respect to health insurance issuers that issue, 
sell, renew, or offer health insurance coverage in the State.


<R05>
Sec. 150.203  Circumstances requiring CMS enforcement.

    CMS enforces HIPAA requirements to the extent warranted (as 
determined by CMS) in any of the following circumstances:
    (a) Notification by State. A State notifies CMS that it has not 
enacted legislation to enforce or that it is not otherwise enforcing 
HIPAA requirements.
    (b) Determination by CMS. If CMS receives or obtains information 
that a State may not be substantially enforcing HIPAA requirements, it 
may initiate the process described in this subchapter to determine 
whether the State is failing to substantially enforce these 
requirements.
    (c) Special rule for guaranteed availability in the individual 
market. If a State has notified CMS that it is implementing an 
acceptable alternative mechanism in accordance with Sec. 148.128 of this 
subchapter instead of complying with the guaranteed availability 
requirements of Sec. 148.120, CMS's determination focuses on the 
following:
    (1) Whether the State's mechanism meets the requirements for an 
acceptable alternative mechanism.
    (2) Whether the State is implementing the acceptable alternative 
mechanism.
    (d) Consequence of a State not implementing an alternative 
mechanism. If a State is not implementing an acceptable alternative 
mechanism, CMS determines whether the State is substantially enforcing 
the requirements of Sec.Sec. 148.101 through 148.126 and Sec. 148.170 of 
this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 150.205  Sources of information triggering an investigation of State 
enforcement.

    Information that may trigger an investigation of State enforcement 
includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:
    (a) A complaint received by CMS.
    (b) Information learned during informal contact between CMS and 
State officials.
    (c) A report in the news media.
    (d) Information from the governors and commissioners of insurance of 
the various States regarding the status of their enforcement of HIPAA 
requirements.
    (e) Information obtained during periodic review of State health care 
legislation. CMS may review State health care and insurance legislation 
and regulations to determine whether they are:
    (1) Consistent with HIPAA requirements.
    (2) Not pre-empted as provided in Sec. 146.143 (relating to group 
market provisions) and Sec. 148.120 (relating to individual market 
requirements) on the basis that they prevent the application of a HIPAA 
requirement.
    (f) Any other information that indicates a possible failure to 
substantially enforce.


<R05>
Sec. 150.207  Procedure for determining that a State fails to substantially 
enforce HIPAA requirements.

    Sections 150.209 through 150.219 describe the procedures CMS follows 
to determine whether a State is substantially enforcing HIPAA 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 150.209  Verification of exhaustion of remedies and contact with State 
officials.

    If CMS receives a complaint or other information indicating that a 
State is

[[Page 661]]

failing to enforce HIPAA requirements, CMS assesses whether the affected 
individual or entity has made reasonable efforts to exhaust available 
State remedies. As part of its assessment, CMS may contact State 
officials regarding the questions raised.


<R05>
Sec. 150.211  Notice to the State.

    If CMS is satisfied that there is a reasonable question whether 
there has been a failure to substantially enforce HIPAA requirements, 
CMS sends, in writing, the notice described in Sec. 150.213 of this 
part, to the following State officials:
    (a) The governor or chief executive officer of the State.
    (b) The insurance commissioner or chief insurance regulatory 
official.
    (c) If the alleged failure involves HMOs, the official responsible 
for regulating HMOs if different from the official listed in paragraph 
(b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 150.213  Form and content of notice.

    The notice provided to the State is in writing and does the 
following:
    (a) Identifies the HIPAA requirement or requirements that have 
allegedly not been substantially enforced.
    (b) Describes the factual basis for the allegation of a failure or 
failures to enforce HIPAA requirements.
    (c) Explains that the consequence of a State's failure to 
substantially enforce HIPAA requirements is that CMS enforces them.
    (d) Advises the State that it has 30 days from the date of the 
notice to respond, unless the time for response is extended as described 
in Sec. 150.215 of this subpart. The State's response should include any 
information that the State wishes CMS to consider in making the 
preliminary determination described in Sec. 150.217.


<R05>
Sec. 150.215  Extension for good cause.

    CMS may extend, for good cause, the time the State has for 
responding to the notice described in Sec. 150.213 of this subpart. 
Examples of good cause include an agreement between CMS and the State 
that there should be a public hearing on the State's enforcement, or 
evidence that the State is undertaking expedited enforcement activities.


<R05>
Sec. 150.217  Preliminary determination.

    If, at the end of the 30-day period (and any extension), the State 
has not established to CMS's satisfaction that it is substantially 
enforcing the HIPAA requirements described in the notice, CMS takes the 
following actions:
    (a) Consults with the appropriate State officials identified in Sec. 
150.211 (or their designees).
    (b) Notifies the State of CMS's preliminary determination that the 
State has failed to substantially enforce the requirements and that the 
failure is continuing.
    (c) Permits the State a reasonable opportunity to show evidence of 
substantial enforcement.


<R05>
Sec. 150.219  Final determination.

    If, after providing notice and a reasonable opportunity for the 
State to show that it has corrected any failure to substantially 
enforce, CMS finds that the failure to substantially enforce has not 
been corrected, it will send the State a written notice of its final 
determination. The notice includes the following:
    (a) Identification of the HIPAA requirements that CMS is enforcing.
    (b) The effective date of CMS's enforcement.


<R05>
Sec. 150.221  Transition to State enforcement.

    (a) If CMS determines that a State for which it has assumed 
enforcement authority has enacted and implemented legislation to enforce 
HIPAA requirements and also determines that it is appropriate to return 
enforcement authority to the State, CMS will enter into discussions with 
State officials to ensure that a transition is effected with respect to 
the following:
    (1) Consumer complaints and inquiries.
    (2) Instructions to issuers.
    (3) Any other pertinent aspect of operations.
    (b) CMS may also negotiate a process to ensure that, to the extent 
practicable, and as permitted by law, its records documenting issuer 
compliance and other relevant areas of CMS's enforcement operations are 
made available for incorporation into the records of the State 
regulatory authority that

[[Page 662]]

will assume enforcement responsibility.


<R04>
   Subpart C--CMS Enforcement With Respect to Issuers and Non-Federal 
                Governmental Plans--Civil Money Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 150.301  General rule regarding the imposition of civil money penalties.

    If any health insurance issuer that is subject to CMS's enforcement 
authority under Sec. 150.101(b)(2), or any non-Federal governmental plan 
(or employer that sponsors a non-Federal governmental plan) that is 
subject to CMS's enforcement authority under Sec. 150.101(b)(1), fails 
to comply with HIPAA requirements, it may be subject to a civil money 
penalty as described in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 150.303  Basis for initiating an investigation of a potential violation.

    (a) Information. Any information that indicates that any issuer may 
be failing to meet the HIPAA requirements or that any non-Federal 
governmental plan that is a group health plan as defined in section 
2791(a)(1) of the PHS Act and 45 CFR Sec. 144.103 may be failing to meet 
an applicable HIPAA requirement, may warrant an investigation. CMS may 
consider, but is not limited to, the following sources or types of 
information:
    (1) Complaints.
    (2) Reports from State insurance departments, the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners, and other Federal and State 
agencies.
    (3) Any other information that indicates potential noncompliance 
with HIPAA requirements.
    (b) Who may file a complaint. Any entity or individual, or any 
entity or personal representative acting on that individual's behalf, 
may file a complaint with CMS if he or she believes that a right to 
which the aggrieved person is entitled under HIPAA requirements is 
being, or has been, denied or abridged as a result of any action or 
failure to act on the part of an issuer or other responsible entity as 
defined in Sec. 150.305.
    (c) Where a complaint should be directed. A complaint may be 
directed to any CMS regional office.


<R05>
Sec. 150.305  Determination of entity liable for civil money penalty.

    If a failure to comply is established under this Part, the 
responsible entity, as determined under this section, is liable for any 
civil money penalty imposed.
    (a) Health insurance issuer is responsible entity--(1) Group health 
insurance policy. To the extent a group health insurance policy issued, 
sold, renewed, or offered to a private plan sponsor or a non-Federal 
governmental plan sponsor is subject to applicable HIPAA requirements, a 
health insurance issuer is subject to a civil money penalty, 
irrespective of whether a civil money penalty is imposed under 
paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, if the policy itself or the 
manner in which the policy is marketed or administered fails to comply 
with an applicable HIPAA requirement.
    (2) Individual health insurance policy. To the extent an individual 
health insurance policy is subject to an applicable HIPAA requirement, a 
health insurance issuer is subject to a civil money penalty if the 
policy itself, or the manner in which the policy is marketed or 
administered, violates any applicable HIPAA requirement.
    (b) Non-Federal governmental plan is responsible entity. (1) Basic 
rule. If a non-Federal governmental plan is sponsored by two or more 
employers and fails to comply with an applicable HIPAA requirement, the 
plan is subject to a civil money penalty, irrespective of whether a 
civil money penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section. The 
plan is the responsible entity irrespective of whether the plan is 
administered by a health insurance issuer, an employer sponsoring the 
plan, or a third-party administrator.
    (2) Exception. In the case of a non-Federal governmental plan that 
is not provided through health insurance coverage, this paragraph (b) 
does not apply to the extent that the non-Federal governmental employers 
have elected under Sec. 146.180 to exempt the plan from applicable HIPAA 
requirements.
    (c) Employer is responsible entity. (1) Basic rule. If a non-Federal 
governmental plan is sponsored by a single employer and fails to comply 
with an applicable HIPAA requirement, the employer is subject to a civil 
money

[[Page 663]]

penalty, irrespective of whether a civil money penalty is imposed under 
paragraph (a) of this section. The employer is the responsible entity 
irrespective of whether the plan is administered by a health insurance 
issuer, the employer, or a third-party administrator.
    (2) Exception. In the case of a non-Federal governmental plan that 
is not provided through health insurance coverage, this paragraph (c) 
does not apply to the extent the non-Federal governmental employer has 
elected under Sec. 146.180 to exempt the plan from applicable HIPAA 
requirements.
    (d) Actions or inactions of agent. A principal is liable for 
penalties assessed for the actions or inactions of its agent.


<R05>
Sec. 150.307  Notice to responsible entities.

    If an investigation under Sec. 150.303 indicates a potential 
violation, CMS provides written notice to the responsible entity or 
entities identified under Sec. 150.305. The notice does the following:
    (a) Describes the substance of any complaint or other information. 
(See Appendix A to this subpart for examples of violations.)
    (b) Provides 30 days from the date of the notice for the responsible 
entity or entities to respond with additional information, including 
documentation of compliance as described in Sec. 150.311.
    (c) States that a civil money penalty may be assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 150.309  Request for extension.

    In circumstances in which an entity cannot prepare a response to CMS 
within the 30 days provided in the notice, the entity may make a written 
request for an extension from CMS detailing the reason for the extension 
request and showing good cause. If CMS grants the extension, the 
responsible entity must respond to the notice within the time frame 
specified in CMS's letter granting the extension of time. Failure to 
respond within 30 days, or within the extended time frame, may result in 
CMS's imposition of a civil money penalty based upon the complaint or 
other information alleging or indicating a violation of HIPAA 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 150.311  Responses to allegations of noncompliance.

    In determining whether to impose a civil money penalty, CMS reviews 
and considers documentation provided in any complaint or other 
information, as well as any additional information provided by the 
responsible entity to demonstrate that it has complied with HIPAA 
requirements. The following are examples of documentation that a 
potential responsible entity may submit for CMS's consideration in 
determining whether a civil money penalty should be assessed and the 
amount of any civil money penalty:
    (a) Any individual policy, group policy, certificate of insurance, 
application, rider, amendment, endorsement, certificate of creditable 
coverage, advertising material, or any other documents if those 
documents form the basis of a complaint or allegation of noncompliance, 
or the basis for the responsible entity to refute the complaint or 
allegation.
    (b) Any other evidence that refutes an alleged noncompliance.
    (c) Evidence that the entity did not know, and exercising due 
diligence could not have known, of the violation.
    (d) Documentation that the policies, certificates of insurance, or 
non-Federal governmental plan documents have been amended to comply with 
HIPAA requirements either by revision of the contracts or by the 
development of riders, amendments, or endorsements.
    (e) Documentation of the entity's issuance of conforming policies, 
certificates of insurance, plan documents, or amendments to 
policyholders or certificate holders before the issuance of the notice 
of intent to assess a penalty described in Sec. 150.307.
    (f) Evidence documenting the development and implementation of 
internal policies and procedures by an issuer, or non-Federal 
governmental health plan or employer, to ensure compliance with HIPAA 
requirements. Those policies and procedures may include or consist of a 
voluntary compliance program. Any such program should do the following:
    (1) Effectively articulate and demonstrate the fundamental mission 
of compliance and the issuer's, or non-

[[Page 664]]

Federal governmental health plan's or employer's, commitment to the 
compliance process.
    (2) Include the name of the individual in the organization 
responsible for compliance.
    (3) Include an effective monitoring system to identify practices 
that do not comply with HIPAA requirements and to provide reasonable 
assurance that fraud, abuse, and systemic errors are detected in a 
timely manner.
    (4) Address procedures to improve internal policies when 
noncompliant practices are identified.
    (g) Evidence documenting the entity's record of previous compliance 
with HIPAA requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 150.313  Market conduct examinations.

    (a) Definition. A market conduct examination means the examination 
of health insurance operations of an issuer, or the operation of a non-
Federal governmental plan, involving the review of one or more (or a 
combination) of a responsible entity's business or operational affairs, 
or both, to verify compliance with HIPAA requirements.
    (b) General. If, based on the information described in Sec. 150.303, 
CMS finds evidence that a specific entity may be in violation of a HIPAA 
requirement, CMS may initiate a market conduct examination to determine 
whether the entity is out of compliance. CMS may conduct the 
examinations either at the site of the issuer or other responsible 
entity or a site CMS selects. When CMS selects a site, it may direct the 
issuer or other responsible entity to forward any documentation CMS 
considers relevant for purposes of the examination to that site.
    (c) Appointment of examiners. When CMS identifies an issue that 
warrants investigation, CMS will appoint one or more examiners to 
perform the examination and instruct them as to the scope of the 
examination.
    (d) Appointment of professionals and specialists. When conducting an 
examination under this part, CMS may retain attorneys, independent 
actuaries, independent market conduct examiners, or other professionals 
and specialists as examiners.
    (e) Report of market conduct examination. (1) CMS review. When CMS 
receives a report, it will review the report, together with the 
examination work papers and any other relevant information, and prepare 
a final report. The final examination report will be provided to the 
issuer or other responsible entity.
    (2) Response from issuer or other responsible entity. With respect 
to each examination issue identified in the report, the issuer or other 
responsible entity may:
    (i) Concur with CMS's position(s) as outlined in the report, 
explaining the plan of correction to be implemented.
    (ii) Dispute CMS's position(s), clearly outlining the basis for its 
dispute and submitting illustrative examples where appropriate.
    (3) CMS's reply to a response from an issuer or other responsible 
entity. Upon receipt of a response from the issuer or other responsible 
entity, CMS will provide a letter containing its reply to each 
examination issue. CMS's reply will consist of one of the following:
    (i) Concurrence with the issuer's or non-Federal governmental plan's 
position.
    (ii) Approval of the issuer's or non-Federal governmental plan's 
proposed plan of correction.
    (iii) Conditional approval of the issuer's or non-Federal 
governmental plan's proposed plan of correction, which will include any 
modifications CMS requires.
    (iv) Notice to the issuer or non-Federal governmental plan that 
there exists a potential violation of HIPAA requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 150.315  Amount of penalty--General.

    A civil money penalty for each violation of 42 U.S.C. 300gg et seq. 
may not exceed $100 for each day, for each responsible entity, for each 
individual affected by the violation. Penalties imposed under this part 
are in addition to any other penalties prescribed or allowed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 150.317  Factors CMS uses to determine the amount of penalty.

    In determining the amount of any penalty, CMS takes into account the 
following:

[[Page 665]]

    (a) The entity's previous record of compliance. This may include any 
of the following:
    (1) Any history of prior violations by the responsible entity, 
including whether, at any time before determination of the current 
violation or violations, CMS or any State found the responsible entity 
liable for civil or administrative sanctions in connection with a 
violation of HIPAA requirements.
    (2) Documentation that the responsible entity has submitted its 
policy forms to CMS for compliance review.
    (3) Evidence that the responsible entity has never had a complaint 
for noncompliance with HIPAA requirements filed with a State or CMS.
    (4) Such other factors as justice may require.
    (b) The gravity of the violation. This may include any of the 
following:
    (1) The frequency of the violation, taking into consideration 
whether any violation is an isolated occurrence, represents a pattern, 
or is widespread.
    (2) The level of financial and other impacts on affected 
individuals.
    (3) Other factors as justice may require.


<R05>
Sec. 150.319  Determining the amount of the penalty--mitigating circumstances.

    For every violation subject to a civil money penalty, if there are 
substantial or several mitigating circumstances, the aggregate amount of 
the penalty is set at an amount sufficiently below the maximum permitted 
by Sec. 150.315 to reflect that fact. As guidelines for taking into 
account the factors listed in Sec. 150.317, CMS considers the following:
    (a) Record of prior compliance. It should be considered a mitigating 
circumstance if the responsible entity has done any of the following:
    (1) Before receipt of the notice issued under Sec. 150.307, 
implemented and followed a compliance plan as described in Sec. 
150.311(f).
    (2) Had no previous complaints against it for noncompliance.
    (b) Gravity of the violation(s). It should be considered a 
mitigating circumstance if the responsible entity has done any of the 
following:
    (1) Made adjustments to its business practices to come into 
compliance with HIPAA requirements so that the following occur:
    (i) All employers, employees, individuals and non-Federal 
governmental entities are identified that are or were issued any policy, 
certificate of insurance or plan document, or any form used in 
connection therewith that failed to comply.
    (ii) All employers, employees, individuals, and non-Federal 
governmental plans are identified that were denied coverage or were 
denied a right provided under HIPAA requirements.
    (iii) Each employer, employee, individual, or non-Federal 
governmental plan adversely affected by the violation has been, for 
example, offered coverage or provided a certificate of creditable 
coverage in a manner that complies with HIPAA requirements that were 
violated so that, to the extent practicable, that employer, employee, 
individual, or non-Federal governmental entity is in the same position 
that he, she, or it would have been in had the violation not occurred.
    (iv) The adjustments are completed in a timely manner.
    (2) Discovered areas of noncompliance without notice from CMS and 
voluntarily reported that noncompliance, provided that the responsible 
entity submits the following:
    (i) Documentation verifying that the rights and protections of all 
individuals adversely affected by the noncompliance have been restored; 
and
    (ii) A plan of correction to prevent future similar violations.
    (3) Demonstrated that the violation is an isolated occurrence.
    (4) Demonstrated that the financial and other impacts on affected 
individuals is negligible or nonexistent.
    (5) Demonstrated that the noncompliance is correctable and that a 
high percentage of the violations were corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 150.321  Determining the amount of penalty--aggravating circumstances.

    For every violation subject to a civil money penalty, if there are 
substantial or several aggravating circumstances, CMS sets the aggregate 
amount of the

[[Page 666]]

penalty at an amount sufficiently close to or at the maximum permitted 
by Sec. 150.315 to reflect that fact. CMS considers the following 
circumstances to be aggravating circumstances:
    (a) The frequency of violation indicates a pattern of widespread 
occurrence.
    (b) The violation(s) resulted in significant financial and other 
impacts on the average affected individual.
    (c) The entity does not provide documentation showing that 
substantially all of the violations were corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 150.323  Determining the amount of penalty--other matters as justice 
may require.

    CMS may take into account other circumstances of an aggravating or 
mitigating nature if, in the interests of justice, they require either a 
reduction or an increase of the penalty in order to assure the 
achievement of the purposes of this part, and if those circumstances 
relate to the entity's previous record of compliance or the gravity of 
the violation.


<R05>
Sec. 150.325  Settlement authority.

    Nothing in Sec.Sec. 150.315 through 150.323 limits the authority of 
CMS to settle any issue or case described in the notice furnished in 
accordance with Sec. 150.307 or to compromise on any penalty provided 
for in Sec.Sec. 150.315 through 150.323.


<R05>
Sec. 150.341  Limitations on penalties.

    (a) Circumstances under which a civil money penalty is not imposed. 
CMS does not impose any civil money penalty on any failure for the 
period of time during which none of the responsible entities knew, or 
exercising reasonable diligence would have known, of the failure. CMS 
also does not impose a civil money penalty for the period of time after 
any of the responsible entities knew, or exercising reasonable diligence 
would have known of the failure, if the failure was due to reasonable 
cause and not due to willful neglect and the failure was corrected 
within 30 days of the first day that any of the entities against whom 
the penalty would be imposed knew, or exercising reasonable diligence 
would have known, that the failure existed.
    (b) Burden of establishing knowledge. The burden is on the 
responsible entity or entities to establish to CMS's satisfaction that 
no responsible entity knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would 
have known, that the failure existed.


<R05>
Sec. 150.343  Notice of proposed penalty.

    If CMS proposes to assess a penalty in accordance with this part, it 
delivers to the responsible entity, or sends to that entity by certified 
mail, return receipt requested, written notice of its intent to assess a 
penalty. The notice includes the following:
    (a) A description of the HIPAA requirements that CMS has determined 
that the responsible entity violated.
    (b) A description of any complaint or other information upon which 
CMS based its determination, including the basis for determining the 
number of affected individuals and the number of days for which the 
violations occurred.
    (c) The amount of the proposed penalty as of the date of the notice.
    (d) Any circumstances described in Sec.Sec. 150.317 through 150.323 
that were considered when determining the amount of the proposed 
penalty.
    (e) A specific statement of the responsible entity's right to a 
hearing.
    (f) A statement that failure to request a hearing within 30 days 
permits the assessment of the proposed penalty without right of appeal 
in accordance with Sec. 150.347.


<R05>
Sec. 150.345  Appeal of proposed penalty.

    Any entity against which CMS has assessed a penalty may appeal that 
penalty in accordance with Sec. 150.401 et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 150.347  Failure to request a hearing.

    If the responsible entity does not request a hearing within 30 days 
of the issuance of the notice described in Sec. 150.343, CMS may assess 
the proposed civil money penalty, a less severe penalty, or a more 
severe penalty. CMS notifies the responsible entity in writing of any 
penalty that has been assessed and of the means by which the responsible 
entity may satisfy the judgment. The responsible entity has no right to 
appeal a penalty with respect to which it has not requested a

[[Page 667]]

hearing in accordance with Sec. 150.405 unless the responsible entity 
can show good cause, as determined under Sec. 150.405(b), for failing to 
timely exercise its right to a hearing.

       Appendix A to Subpart C of Part 150--Examples of Violations

    This appendix lists actions in the group and individual markets for 
which CMS may impose civil money penalties. This list is not all-
inclusive.

    Note 1: All cross-references to sections of the Code of Federal 
Regulations are cross-references to sections in parts 144, 146, or 148 
of this subchapter.
    Note 2: Except as otherwise expressly noted, all references to non-
Federal governmental plans refer to non-Federal governmental plans that 
are not exempt from HIPAA requirements (as defined in Sec. 150.103) 
under section 2721(b)(2) of the PHS Act and Sec. 146.180.

 I. Basis for Imposition of Civil Money Penalties--Actions in the Group 
                                 Market

    a. Failure to comply with the limitations on pre-existing condition 
exclusions (Sec. 146.111).
    Violations of the limitations on preexisting condition exclusions, 
set forth in Sec. 146.111, includes those circumstances in which a non-
Federal governmental plan or health insurance issuer offering group 
health insurance coverage does the following:
    (1) Imposes a preexisting condition exclusion period that exceeds 12 
months or, in the case of a late enrollee, 18 months, from the 
enrollment date (the first day of coverage or the first day of the 
waiting period, if any).
    (2) Fails to reduce a pre-existing condition exclusion period by 
creditable coverage as provided in Sec.Sec. 146.111(a)(1)(iii) and 
146.113.
    (3) Imposes a pre-existing condition exclusion period without first 
giving the two written notices required in Sec.Sec. 146.111(c) and 
146.115(d). The first notice is a general notice to all plan 
participants of the existence and terms of any pre-existing condition 
exclusion under the plan, and the rights of individuals to demonstrate 
creditable coverage. The notice should explain the right of an 
individual to request a certificate from a previous plan or issuer, if 
necessary, and include a statement that the current plan or issuer will 
assist in obtaining a certificate from a previous plan or issuer, if 
necessary. The second notice is required to be sent to any individual 
who has presented evidence of creditable coverage, and to whom a pre-
existing condition exclusion period will be applied. This second notice 
informs the individual of the plan's determination of any pre-existing 
condition exclusion period, the basis for such determination, a written

Sec. 146.111(b)(4). For example, an issuer may not refuse to pay for 
prenatal care and delivery effective with the date maternity coverage 
began because the individual did not have maternity coverage at the time

child who enrolls in a group health plan within 30 days of birth, 
adoption, or placement for adoption.

    (8) Determines whether a pre-existing condition exclusion applies by 
using a standard other than whether medical advice, diagnosis, care, or 
treatment was actually recommended or received during the look-back 
period. A determination that a reasonably prudent person would or should 
have sought medical care for the condition is an unacceptable standard 
by which to determine whether a pre-existing condition exclusion 
applies.
    (9) Uses genetic information as part of the definition of pre-
existing condition in the absence of a diagnosis of the condition 
related to the genetic information.
    (10) Otherwise fails to comply with Sec. 146.111.

standard method described in Sec. 146.113(b) or the alternative method 
described in Sec. 146.113(c), if it elects to use the alternative 
method.
    (3) Treats an individual with fewer than 63 consecutive days without 
creditable coverage as having a significant break in coverage in 
violation of Sec. 146.113(b)(2)(iii).
    (4) Takes either a waiting period or an affiliation period into 
account when calculating a significant break in coverage, as prohibited 
by Sec. 146.113(b)(2)(iii).
    (5) Otherwise fails to comply with Sec. 146.113.

alleged. All motions must be in writing, with a copy served on the 
opposing party, except in either of the following situations:
    (1) The motion is presented during an oral proceeding before an ALJ 
at which both parties have the opportunity to be present.
    (2) An extension of time is being requested by agreement of the 
parties or with waiver of objections by the opposing party.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, any response or 
opposition to a motion must be filed within 20 days of the party's 
receipt of the motion. The ALJ does not rule on a motion before the time 
for filing a response to the motion has expired except where the 
response is filed at an earlier date, where the opposing party consents 
to the motion being granted, or where the ALJ determines that the motion 
should be denied.


<R05>
Sec. 150.427  Form and service of submissions.

    (a) Every submission filed with the ALJ must be filed in triplicate, 
including one original of any signed documents, and include:
    (1) A caption on the first page, setting forth the title of the 
case, the docket number (if known), and a description of the submission 
(such as ``Motion for Discovery'').
    (2) The signatory's name, address, and telephone number.
    (3) A signed certificate of service, specifying each address to 
which a copy of the submission is sent, the date on which it is sent, 
and the method of service.
    (b) A party filing a submission with the ALJ must, at the time of 
filing, serve a copy of such submission on the opposing party. An 
intervenor filing a submission with the ALJ must, at the time of filing, 
serve a copy of the submission on all parties. Service must be made by 
mailing or hand delivering a copy of the submission to the opposing 
party. If a party is represented by an attorney, service must be made on 
the attorney.


<R05>
Sec. 150.429  Computation of time and extensions of time.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, in computing any period of time, 
the time begins with the day following the act, event, or default and 
includes the last day of the period unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday observed by the Federal government, in which event it 
includes the next business day. When the period of time allowed is less 
than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays 
observed by the Federal government are excluded from the computation.
    (b) The period of time for filing any responsive pleading or papers 
is determined by the date of receipt (as defined in Sec. 150.401) of the 
submission to which a response is being made.
    (c) The ALJ may grant extensions of the filing deadlines specified 
in these regulations or set by the ALJ for good cause shown (except that 
requests for extensions of time to file a request for hearing may be 
granted only on the grounds specified in section Sec. 150.405(b)).


<R05>
Sec. 150.431  Acknowledgment of request for hearing.

    After receipt of the request for hearing, the ALJ assigned to the 
case or someone acting on behalf of the ALJ will send a letter to the 
parties that acknowledges receipt of the request for

[[Page 674]]

hearing, identifies the docket number assigned to the case, provides 
instructions for filing submissions and other general information 
concerning procedures, and sets out the next steps in the case.


<R05>
Sec. 150.435  Discovery.

    (a) The parties must identify any need for discovery from the 
opposing party as soon as possible, but no later than the time for the 
reply specified in Sec. 150.437(c). Upon request of a party, the ALJ may 
stay proceedings for a reasonable period pending completion of discovery 
if the ALJ determines that a party would not be able to make the 
submissions required by Sec. 150.437 without discovery. The parties 
should attempt to resolve any discovery issues informally before seeking 
an order from the ALJ.
    (b) Discovery devices may include requests for production of 
documents, requests for admission, interrogatories, depositions, and 
stipulations. The ALJ orders interrogatories or depositions only if 
these are the only means to develop the record adequately on an issue 
that the ALJ must resolve to decide the case.
    (c) Each discovery request must be responded to within 30 days of 
receipt, unless that period of time is extended for good cause by the 
ALJ.
    (d) A party to whom a discovery request is directed may object in 
writing for any of the following reasons:
    (1) Compliance with the request is unduly burdensome or expensive.
    (2) Compliance with the request will unduly delay the proceedings.
    (3) The request seeks information that is wholly outside of any 
matter in dispute.
    (4) The request seeks privileged information. Any party asserting a 
claim of privilege must sufficiently describe the information or 
document being withheld to show that the privilege applies. If an 
asserted privilege applies to only part of a document, a party 
withholding the entire document must state why the nonprivileged part is 
not segregable.
    (e) Any motion to compel discovery must be filed within 10 days 
after receipt of objections to the party's discovery request, within 10 
days after the time for response to the discovery request has elapsed if 
no response is received, or within 10 days after receipt of an 
incomplete response to the discovery request. The motion must be 
reasonably specific as to the information or document sought and must 
state its relevance to the issues in the case.


<R05>
Sec. 150.437  Submission of briefs and proposed hearing exhibits.

    (a) Within 60 days of its receipt of the acknowledgment provided for 
in Sec. 150.431, the respondent must file the following with the ALJ:
    (1) A statement of its arguments concerning CMS's notice of 
assessment (respondent's brief), including citations to the respondent's 
hearing exhibits provided in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. The brief may not address factual or legal bases for the 
assessment that the respondent did not identify as disputed in its 
request for hearing or in an amendment to that request permitted by the 
ALJ.
    (2) All documents (including any affidavits) supporting its 
arguments, tabbed and organized chronologically and accompanied by an 
indexed list identifying each document (respondent's proposed hearing 
exhibits).
    (3) A statement regarding whether there is a need for an in-person 
hearing and, if so, a list of proposed witnesses and a summary of their 
expected testimony that refers to any factual dispute to which the 
testimony will relate.
    (4) Any stipulations or admissions.
    (b) Within 30 days of its receipt of the respondent's submission 
required by paragraph (a) of this section, CMS will file the following 
with the ALJ:
    (1) A statement responding to the respondent's brief, including the 
respondent's proposed hearing exhibits, if appropriate. The statement 
may include citations to CMS's proposed hearing exhibits submitted in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Any documents supporting CMS's response not already submitted as 
part of the respondent's proposed hearing exhibits, organized and 
indexed as indicated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (CMS's proposed 
hearing exhibits).
    (3) A statement regarding whether there is a need for an in-person 
hearing

[[Page 675]]

and, if so, a list of proposed witnesses and a summary of their expected 
testimony that refers to any factual dispute to which the testimony will 
relate.
    (4) Any admissions or stipulations.
    (c) Within 15 days of its receipt of CMS's submission required by 
paragraph (b) of this section, the respondent may file with the ALJ a 
reply to CMS's submission.


<R05>
Sec. 150.439  Effect of submission of proposed hearing exhibits.

    (a) Any proposed hearing exhibit submitted by a party in accordance 
with Sec. 150.437 is deemed part of the record unless the opposing party 
raises an objection to that exhibit and the ALJ rules to exclude it from 
the record. An objection must be raised either in writing prior to the 
prehearing conference provided for in Sec. 150.441 or at the prehearing 
conference. The ALJ may require a party to submit the original hearing 
exhibit on his or her own motion or in response to a challenge to the 
authenticity of a proposed hearing exhibit.
    (b) A party may introduce a proposed hearing exhibit following the 
times for submission specified in Sec. 150.437 only if the party 
establishes to the satisfaction of the ALJ that it could not have 
produced the exhibit earlier and that the opposing party will not be 
prejudiced.


<R05>
Sec. 150.441  Prehearing conferences.

    An ALJ may schedule one or more prehearing conferences (generally 
conducted by telephone) on the ALJ's own motion or at the request of 
either party for the purpose of any of the following:

    (b) Establishing a schedule for any supplements to the submissions 
required by Sec. 150.437 because of information obtained through 
discovery.

    (a) In all cases before an ALJ--
    (1) CMS has the burden of coming forward with evidence sufficient to 
establish a prima facie case;
    (2) The respondent has the burden of coming forward with evidence in 
response, once CMS has established a prima facie case; and
    (3) CMS has the burden of persuasion regarding facts material to the 
assessment; and
    (4) The respondent has the burden of persuasion regarding facts 
relating to an affirmative defense.
    (b) The preponderance of the evidence standard applies to all cases 
before the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 150.445  Evidence.

    (a) The ALJ will determine the admissibility of evidence.

the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal 
Rules of Evidence where appropriate; for example, to exclude unreliable 
evidence.
    (c) The ALJ excludes irrelevant or immaterial evidence.
    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, 
confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Although relevant, evidence is excluded if it is privileged 
under Federal law.
    (f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement made in 
this action will be inadmissible to the extent provided in the Federal 
Rules of Evidence.
    (g) Evidence of acts other than those at issue in the instant case 
is admissible in determining the amount of any civil money penalty if 
those acts are used under Sec.Sec. 150.317 and 150.323 of this part to 
consider the entity's prior

[[Page 676]]

record of compliance, or to show motive, opportunity, intent, knowledge, 
preparation, identity, or lack of mistake. This evidence is admissible 
regardless of whether the acts occurred during the statute of 
limitations period applicable to the acts that constitute the basis for 
liability in the case and regardless of whether CMS's notice sent in 
accordance with Sec.Sec. 150.307 and 150.343 referred to them.
    (h) The ALJ will permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses 
and evidence.
    (i) All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record 
will be open to examination by all parties, unless the ALJ orders 
otherwise for good cause shown.
    (j) The ALJ may not consider evidence regarding the willingness and 
ability to enter into and successfully complete a corrective action plan

under Sec. 150.307.


<R05>
Sec. 150.447  The record.

    (a) Any testimony that is taken in-person or by telephone is 
recorded and transcribed. The ALJ may order that other proceedings in a 
case, such as a prehearing conference or oral argument of a motion, be 
recorded and transcribed.
    (b) The transcript of any testimony, exhibits and other evidence 
that is admitted, and all pleadings and other documents that are filed 
in the case constitute the record for purposes of an ALJ decision.
    (c) For good cause, the ALJ may order appropriate redactions made to 
the record.


<R05>
Sec. 150.449  Cost of transcripts.

    Generally, each party is responsible for 50 percent of the

    Each party is entitled to file proposed findings and conclusions, 
and supporting reasons, in a posthearing brief. The ALJ will establish 
the schedule by which such briefs must be filed. The ALJ may direct the

file posthearing reply briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 150.453  ALJ decision.

    The ALJ will issue an initial agency decision based only on the 
record and on applicable law; the decision will contain findings of fact

comply with an order or other directive or with a requirement of a 
regulation, for abandonment of a case, or for other actions that 
interfere with the speedy, orderly or fair conduct of the hearing. Any 
sanction that is imposed will relate reasonably to the severity and 
nature of the failure or action.
    (b) A sanction may include any of the following actions:
    (1) In the case of failure or refusal to provide or permit 
discovery, drawing negative fact inferences or treating such failure or 
refusal as an admission by deeming the matter, or certain facts, to be 
established.
    (2) Prohibiting a party from introducing certain evidence or 
otherwise advocating a particular claim or defense.
    (3) Striking pleadings, in whole or in part.
    (4) Staying the case.

    (b) The Administrator may decide to review an initial agency 
decision if it appears from a preliminary review of

this section must be limited to issues the Administrator has identified 
in his or her notice of intent to review, if the Administrator has given 
notice of an intent to review the initial agency decision only in part. 
A copy of this submission must be sent to the other party.
    (f) After receipt of any submissions made pursuant to paragraph (d) 
of this section and any additional submissions for which the 
Administrator may provide, the Administrator will affirm, reverse, 
modify, or remand the initial agency decision. The Administrator will 
mail a copy of his or her decision to the respondent.
    (g) The Administrator's decision will be based on the record on 
which the initial agency decision was based (as forwarded by the ALJ to 
the Administrator) and any materials submitted pursuant to paragraphs 
(b), (d), and (f) of this section.
    (h) The Administrator's decision may rely on decisions of any courts 
and other applicable law, whether or not cited in the initial agency 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 150.459  Judicial review.

    (a) Filing of an action for review. Any responsible entity against 
whom a final order imposing a civil money penalty is entered may obtain 
review in the United States District Court for any district in which the 
entity is located or in the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia by doing the following:

    If any entity fails to pay an assessment after it becomes a final 
order, or after the court has entered final judgment in favor of CMS, 
CMS refers the matter to the Attorney General, who brings an action

recover the amount assessed.


<R05>

Sec. 160.538  Discovery.

    (a) A party may make a request to another party for production of 
documents for inspection and copying that are relevant and material to 
the issues before the ALJ.
    (b) For the purpose of this section, the term ``documents'' includes 
information, reports, answers, records, accounts, papers and other data 
and documentary evidence. Nothing contained in this section may be 
interpreted to require the creation of a document, except that requested 
data stored in an electronic data storage system must be produced in a 
form accessible to the requesting party.
    (c) Requests for documents, requests for admissions, written 
interrogatories, depositions and any forms of discovery, other than 
those permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, are not authorized.
    (d) This section may not be construed to require the disclosure of 
interview reports or statements obtained by any party, or on behalf of 
any party, of persons who will not be called as witnesses by that party, 
or analyses and summaries prepared in conjunction with the investigation 
or litigation of the case, or any otherwise privileged documents.
    (e)(1) When a request for production of documents has been received, 
within 30 days the party receiving that request must either fully 
respond to the request, or state that the request is being objected to 
and the reasons for that objection. If objection is made to part of an 
item or category, the part must be specified. Upon receiving any 
objections, the party seeking production may then, within 30 days or any 
other time frame set by the ALJ, file a motion for an order compelling 
discovery. The party receiving a request for production may also file a 
motion for protective order any time before the date the production is 
due.
    (2) The ALJ may grant a motion for protective order or deny a motion 
for an order compelling discovery if the ALJ finds that the discovery 
sought--
    (i) Is irrelevant;
    (ii) Is unduly costly or burdensome;
    (iii) Will unduly delay the proceeding; or
    (iv) Seeks privileged information.
    (3) The ALJ may extend any of the time frames set forth in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (4) The burden of showing that discovery should be allowed is on the 
party seeking discovery.


<R05>
Sec. 160.540  Exchange of witness lists, witness statements, and exhibits.

    (a) The parties must exchange witness lists, copies of prior written 
statements of proposed witnesses, and copies of proposed hearing 
exhibits, including copies of any written statements that the party 
intends to offer in lieu of live testimony in accordance with Sec. 
160.556, at least 15 days before the hearing, unless the ALJ orders an 
earlier exchange.
    (b) (1) If at any time a party objects to the proposed admission of 
evidence not exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, 
the ALJ must determine whether the failure to comply with paragraph (a) 
of this section should result in the exclusion of that evidence.
    (2) Unless the ALJ finds that extraordinary circumstances justified 
the failure timely to exchange the information listed under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the ALJ must exclude from the party's case-in-
chief--
    (i) The testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the 
witness list; and
    (ii) Any exhibit not provided to the opposing party as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) If the ALJ finds that extraordinary circumstances existed, the 
ALJ must then determine whether the admission of that evidence would 
cause substantial prejudice to the objecting party. If the ALJ finds 
that there is no substantial prejudice, the evidence may be admitted. If 
the ALJ finds that there is substantial prejudice, the ALJ may exclude 
the evidence, or, if he or she does not exclude the evidence, must 
postpone the hearing for such time as is necessary for the objecting 
party to prepare and respond to the

[[Page 692]]

evidence, unless the objecting party waives postponement.
    (c) Unless the other party objects within a reasonable period of 
time before the hearing, documents exchanged in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section will be deemed to be authentic for the 
purpose of admissibility at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 160.542  Subpoenas for attendance at hearing.

    (a) A party wishing to procure the appearance and testimony of any 
person at the hearing may make a motion requesting the ALJ to issue a 
subpoena if the appearance and testimony are reasonably necessary for 
the presentation of a party's case.
    (b) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a person in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section may also require the person (whether 
or not the person is a party) to produce relevant and material evidence 
at or before the hearing.
    (c) When a subpoena is served by a respondent on a particular 
employee or official or particular office of HHS, the Secretary may 
comply by designating any HHS representative to appear and testify.
    (d) A party seeking a subpoena must file a written motion not less 
than 30 days before the date fixed for the hearing, unless otherwise 
allowed by the ALJ for good cause shown. That motion must--
    (1) Specify any evidence to be produced;
    (2) Designate the witnesses; and
    (3) Describe the address and location with sufficient particularity 
to permit those witnesses to be found.
    (e) The subpoena must specify the time and place at which the 
witness is to appear and any evidence the witness is to produce.
    (f) Within 15 days after the written motion requesting issuance of a 
subpoena is served, any party may file an opposition or other response.
    (g) If the motion requesting issuance of a subpoena is granted, the 
party seeking the subpoena must serve it by delivery to the person 
named, or by certified mail addressed to that person at the person's 
last dwelling place or principal place of business.

ALJ a motion to quash the subpoena within 10 days after service.
    (i) The exclusive remedy for contumacy by, or refusal to obey a 
subpoena duly served upon, any person is specified in 42 U.S.C. 405(e).


<R05>
Sec. 160.544  Fees.

    The party requesting a subpoena must pay the cost of the fees and 
mileage of any witness subpoenaed in the amounts that would be payable 
to a witness in a proceeding in United States District Court. A check 
for witness fees and mileage must accompany the subpoena when served, 
except that when a subpoena is issued on behalf of the Secretary, a 
check for witness fees and mileage need not accompany the subpoena.


<R05>
Sec. 160.546  Form, filing, and service of papers.

    (a) Forms. (1) Unless the ALJ directs the parties to do otherwise, 
documents filed with the ALJ must include an original and two copies.
    (2) Every pleading and paper filed in the proceeding must contain a 
caption setting forth the title of the action, the case number, and a 
designation of the paper, such as motion to quash subpoena.
    (3) Every pleading and paper must be signed by and must contain the 
address and telephone number of the party or the person on whose behalf 
the paper was filed, or his or her representative.
    (4) Papers are considered filed when they are mailed.
    (b) Service. A party filing a document with the ALJ or the Secretary 
must, at the time of filing, serve a copy of the document on the other 
party. Service upon any party of any document must be made by delivering 
a copy, or placing a copy of the document in the United States mail, 
postage prepaid and addressed, or with a private delivery service, to 
the party's last known address. When a party is represented by an 
attorney, service must be made upon the attorney in lieu of the party.
    (c) Proof of service. A certificate of the natural person serving 
the document by personal delivery or by mail,

[[Page 693]]

setting forth the manner of service, constitutes proof of service.


<R05>

    (a) In computing any period of time under this part or in an order 
issued thereunder, the time begins with the day following the act, event 
or default, and includes the last day of the period unless it is a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday observed by the Federal Government, 
in which event it includes the next business day.
    (b) When the period of time allowed is less than 7 days, 
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays observed by the 
Federal Government must be excluded from the computation.
    (c) Where a document has been served or issued by placing it in the 
mail, an additional 5 days must be added to the time permitted for any 
response. This paragraph does not apply to requests for hearing under 
Sec. 160.526.


<R05>
Sec. 160.550  Motions.

    (a) An application to the ALJ for an order or ruling must be by

time as may be fixed by the ALJ, any party may file a response to the 
motion.
    (d) The ALJ may not grant a written motion before the time for 
filing responses has expired, except upon consent of the parties or 
following a hearing on the motion, but may overrule or deny the motion 
without awaiting a response.
    (e) The ALJ must make a reasonable effort to dispose of all 
outstanding motions before the beginning of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 160.552  Sanctions.

    The ALJ may sanction a person, including any party or attorney, for 
failing to comply with an order or procedure, for failing to defend an 
action or for other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, orderly 
or fair conduct of the hearing. The sanctions must reasonably relate to 
the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct. The sanctions may 
include--
    (a) In the case of refusal to provide or permit discovery under the 
terms of this part, drawing negative factual inferences or treating the 
refusal as an admission by deeming the matter, or certain facts, to be 
established;
    (b) Prohibiting a party from introducing certain evidence or 
otherwise supporting a particular claim or defense;
    (c) Striking pleadings, in whole or in part;
    (d) Staying the proceedings;
    (e) Dismissal of the action;
    (f) Entering a decision by default;
    (g) Ordering the party or attorney to pay the attorney's fees and 
other costs caused by the failure or misconduct; and

    (c) After both parties have presented their cases, evidence may be 
admitted in rebuttal even if not previously exchanged in accordance with 
Sec. 160.540.


<R05>
Sec. 160.556  Witnesses.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony 
at the hearing must be given orally by witnesses under oath or 
affirmation.
    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony of witnesses other than 
the testimony of expert witnesses may be admitted in the form of a 
written statement. Any such written statement must be provided to all 
other parties along with the last known address of the witness, in a 
manner that allows sufficient time for the other party to subpoena the 
witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements 
of witnesses proposed to

[[Page 694]]

testify at the hearing must be exchanged as provided in Sec. 160.540. 
The ALJ may, at his or her discretion, admit prior sworn testimony of 
experts that has been subject to adverse examination, such as a 
deposition or trial testimony.
    (c) The ALJ must exercise reasonable control over the mode and order 
of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:
    (1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the 
ascertainment of the truth;
    (2) Avoid repetition or needless consumption of time; and
    (3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
    (d) The ALJ must permit the parties to conduct cross-examination of 
witnesses as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the 
facts.
    (e) The ALJ may order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear 
the testimony of other witnesses. This provision does not authorize the 
exclusion of--
    (1) A party who is a natural person;
    (2) In the case of a party that is an entity, the officer or 
employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated as 
the party's representative; or
    (3) A natural person whose presence is shown by a party to be 
essential to the presentation of its case, including a person engaged in 
assisting the attorney for the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 160.558  Evidence.

    (a) The ALJ must determine the admissibility of evidence.
    (b) Except as provided in this subpart, the ALJ is not bound by the 
Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal Rules 
of Evidence where appropriate, for example, to exclude unreliable 
evidence.
    (c) The ALJ must exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence.
    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,

of a scheme. This evidence is admissible regardless of whether the 
crimes, wrongs, or acts occurred during the statute of limitations 
period applicable to the acts or omissions that constitute the basis for 
liability in the case and regardless of whether they were referenced in 
the Secretary's notice of proposed determination sent in accordance with 
Sec. 160.514.
    (h) The ALJ must permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses 
and evidence.

reasonable fee) by any person, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ for 
good cause shown.

the record.


<R05>
Sec. 160.562  Post hearing briefs.

    The ALJ may require the parties to file post-hearing briefs. In any 
event, any party may file a post-hearing brief. The ALJ must fix the 
time for filing the briefs. The time for filing may not

[[Page 695]]

exceed 60 days from the date the parties receive the transcript of the 
hearing or, if applicable, the stipulated record. The briefs may be 
accompanied by proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The ALJ 
may permit the parties to file reply briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 160.564  ALJ decision.

reason for the delay and set a new deadline.
    (d) The ALJ's decision is the final decision of the Secretary.

    (a) Pending judicial review, the respondent may file a request for 
stay of the effective date of any penalty with the ALJ. The request must 
be accompanied by a copy of the notice of appeal filed with the Federal 
court. The filing of the request automatically stays the effective date 
of the penalty until such time as the ALJ rules upon the request.
    (b) The ALJ may not grant a respondent's request for stay of any 
penalty unless the respondent posts a bond or provides other adequate 
security.
    (c) The ALJ must rule upon a respondent's request for stay within 10 
days of receipt.

<R05>
Sec. 162.923  Requirements for covered entities.

    (a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this part, if a 
covered entity conducts with another covered entity (or within the same 
covered entity), using electronic media, a transaction for which the 
Secretary has adopted a standard under this part, the covered entity 
must conduct the transaction as a standard transaction.
    (b) Exception for direct data entry transactions. A health care 
provider electing to use direct data entry offered by a health plan to 
conduct a transaction for which a standard has been adopted under this 
part must use the applicable data content and data condition 
requirements of the standard when conducting the transaction. The health 
care provider is not required to

[[Page 700]]

use the format requirements of the standard.
    (c) Use of a business associate. A covered entity may use a business 
associate, including a health care clearinghouse, to conduct a 
transaction covered by this part. If a covered entity chooses to use a 
business associate to conduct all or part of a transaction on behalf of 
the covered entity, the covered entity must require the business 
associate to do the following:
    (1) Comply with all applicable requirements of this part.
    (2) Require any agent or subcontractor to comply with all applicable 
requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 162.925  Additional requirements for health plans.

    (a) General rules. (1) If an entity requests a health plan to 
conduct a transaction as a standard transaction, the health plan must do 
so.
    (2) A health plan may not delay or reject a transaction, or attempt 
to adversely affect the other entity or the transaction, because the 
transaction is a standard transaction.
    (3) A health plan may not reject a standard transaction on the basis 
that it contains data elements not needed or used by the health plan 
(for example, coordination of benefits information).
    (4) A health plan may not offer an incentive for a health care 
provider to conduct a transaction covered by this part as a transaction 
described under the exception provided for in Sec. 162.923(b).
    (5) A health plan that operates as a health care clearinghouse, or 
requires an entity to use a health care clearinghouse to receive, 
process, or transmit a standard transaction may not charge fees or costs 
in excess of the fees or costs for normal telecommunications that the 
entity incurs when it directly transmits, or receives, a standard 
transaction to, or from, a health plan.
    (b) Coordination of benefits. If a health plan receives a standard 
transaction and coordinates benefits with another health plan (or 
another payer), it must store the coordination of benefits data it needs 
to forward the standard transaction to the other health plan (or other 
payer).
    (c) Code sets. A health plan must meet each of the following 
requirements:
    (1) Accept and promptly process any standard transaction that 
contains codes that are valid, as provided in subpart J of this part.
    (2) Keep code sets for the current billing period and appeals 
periods still open to processing under the terms of the health plan's 
coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 162.930  Additional rules for health care clearinghouses.

    When acting as a business associate for another covered entity, a 
health care clearinghouse may perform the following functions:
    (a) Receive a standard transaction on behalf of the covered entity 
and translate it into a nonstandard transaction (for example, 
nonstandard format and/or nonstandard data content) for transmission to 
the covered entity.
    (b) Receive a nonstandard transaction (for example, nonstandard 
format and/or nonstandard data content) from the covered entity and 
translate it into a standard transaction for transmission on behalf of 
the covered entity.


<R05>
Sec. 162.940  Exceptions from standards to permit testing of proposed 
modifications.

    (a) Requests for an exception. An organization may request an 
exception from the use of a standard from the Secretary to test a 
proposed modification to that standard. For each proposed modification, 
the organization must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Comparison to a current standard. Provide a detailed 
explanation, no more than 10 pages in length, of how the proposed 
modification would be a significant improvement to the current standard 
in terms of the following principles:
    (i) Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care 
system by leading to cost reductions for, or improvements in benefits 
from, electronic health care transactions.
    (ii) Meet the needs of the health data standards user community, 
particularly health care providers, health plans, and health care 
clearinghouses.

[[Page 701]]

    (iii) Be uniform and consistent with the other standards adopted 
under this part and, as appropriate, with other private and public 
sector health data standards.
    (iv) Have low additional development and implementation costs 
relative to the benefits of using the standard.
    (v) Be supported by an ANSI-accredited SSO or other private or 
public organization that would maintain the standard over time.
    (vi) Have timely development, testing, implementation, and updating 
procedures to achieve administrative simplification benefits faster.

services, but not both, only for purposes related to the appropriate 
function being performed.

    (v) An expiration date or an expiration event that relates to the 
individual or the purpose of the use or disclosure. The statement ``end

authorization must contain statements adequate to place the individual 
on notice of all of the following:

[[Page 731]]

    (i) The individual's right to revoke the authorization in writing,

in paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies; or
    (B) The consequences to the individual of a refusal to sign the 
authorization when, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
the covered entity can condition treatment, enrollment in the health 
plan, or eligibility for benefits on failure to obtain such 
authorization.
    (iii) The potential for information disclosed pursuant to the 
authorization to be subject to redisclosure by the recipient and no 
longer be protected by this subpart.

Sec. 164.510  Uses and disclosures requiring an opportunity for the individual 
to agree or to object.

    A covered entity may use or disclose protected health information, 
provided that the individual is informed in advance of the use or 
disclosure and has the opportunity to agree to or prohibit or restrict 
the use or disclosure, in accordance with the applicable requirements of 
this section. The covered entity may orally inform the individual of and 
obtain the individual's oral agreement or objection to a use or 
disclosure permitted by this section.
    (a) Standard: use and disclosure for facility directories. (1) 
Permitted uses and disclosure. Except when an objection is expressed in 
accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) or (3) of this section, a covered 
health care provider may:
    (i) Use the following protected health information to maintain a 
directory of individuals in its facility:
    (A) The individual's name;
    (B) The individual's location in the covered health care provider's 
facility;
    (C) The individual's condition described in general terms that does 
not communicate specific medical information about the individual; and
    (D) The individual's religious affiliation; and
    (ii) Disclose for directory purposes such information:
    (A) To members of the clergy; or
    (B) Except for religious affiliation, to other persons who ask for 
the individual by name.
    (2) Opportunity to object. A covered health care provider must 
inform an individual of the protected health information that it may 
include in a directory and the persons to whom it may disclose such 
information (including disclosures to clergy of information regarding 
religious affiliation) and provide the individual with the opportunity 
to restrict or prohibit some or all of the uses or disclosures permitted 
by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) Emergency circumstances. (i) If the opportunity to object to 
uses or disclosures required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section cannot 
practicably be provided because of the individual's incapacity or an 
emergency treatment circumstance, a covered health care provider may use 
or disclose some or all of the protected health information permitted by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the facility's directory, if such 
disclosure is:
    (A) Consistent with a prior expressed preference of the individual, 
if any, that is known to the covered health care provider; and
    (B) In the individual's best interest as determined by the covered 
health

[[Page 732]]

care provider, in the exercise of professional judgment.
    (ii) The covered health care provider must inform the individual and 
provide an opportunity to object to uses or disclosures for directory 
purposes as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section when it becomes 
practicable to do so.
    (b) Standard: uses and disclosures for involvement in the 
individual's care and notification purposes. (1) Permitted uses and 
disclosures. (i) A covered entity may, in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(2) or (3) of this section, disclose to a family member, other 
relative, or a close personal friend of the individual, or any other 
person identified by the individual, the protected health information 
directly relevant to such person's involvement with the individual's 
care or payment related to the individual's health care.
    (ii) A covered entity may use or disclose protected health 
information to notify, or assist in the notification of (including 
identifying or locating), a family member, a personal representative of 
the individual, or another person responsible for the care of the 
individual of the individual's location, general condition, or death. 
Any such use or disclosure of protected health information for such 
notification purposes must be in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2), (3), 
or (4) of this section, as applicable.
    (2) Uses and disclosures with the individual present. If the 
individual is present for, or otherwise available prior to, a use or 
disclosure permitted by paragraph (b)(1) of this section and has the 
capacity to make health care decisions, the covered entity may use or 
disclose the protected health information if it:
    (i) Obtains the individual's agreement;
    (ii) Provides the individual with the opportunity to object to the 
disclosure, and the individual does not express an objection; or
    (iii) Reasonably infers from the circumstances, based the exercise 
of professional judgment, that the individual does not object to the 
disclosure.
    (3) Limited uses and disclosures when the individual is not present. 
If the individual is not present, or the opportunity to agree or object 
to the use or disclosure cannot practicably be provided because of the 
individual's incapacity or an emergency circumstance, the covered entity 
may, in the exercise of professional judgment, determine whether the 
disclosure is in the best interests of the individual and, if so, 
disclose only the protected health information that is directly relevant 
to the person's involvement with the individual's health care. A covered 
entity may use professional judgment and its experience with common 
practice to make reasonable inferences of the individual's best interest 
in allowing a person to act on behalf of the individual to pick up 
filled prescriptions, medical supplies, X-rays, or other similar forms 
of protected health information.
    (4) Use and disclosures for disaster relief purposes. A covered 
entity may use or disclose protected health information to a public or 
private entity authorized by law or by its charter to assist in disaster 
relief efforts, for the purpose of coordinating with such entities the 
uses or disclosures permitted by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. 
The requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section apply to 
such uses and disclosure to the extent that the covered entity, in the 
exercise of professional judgment, determines that the requirements do 
not interfere with the ability to respond to the emergency 
circumstances.

Sec. 164.508, or the opportunity for the individual to agree or object 
as described in Sec. 164.510, in the situations covered by this section, 
subject to the applicable requirements of this section. When the covered 
entity is required by this section to inform the individual of, or when 
the individual may agree to, a use or disclosure permitted by this 
section, the covered entity's information and the individual's agreement 
may be given orally.

[[Page 733]]

    (a) Standard: Uses and disclosures required by law. (1) A covered 
entity may use or disclose protected health information to the extent 
that such use or disclosure is required by law and the use or disclosure

information for the public health activities and purposes described in 
this paragraph to:
    (i) A public health authority that is authorized by law to collect 
or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling 
disease, injury, or disability, including, but not limited to, the

    (iii) A person subject to the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) with respect to an FDA-regulated product or 
activity for which that person has responsibility, for the purpose of 
activities related to the quality, safety or effectiveness of such FDA-
regulated product or activity. Such purposes include:
    (A) To collect or report adverse events (or similar activities with 
respect to food or dietary supplements), product defects or problems 
(including problems with the use or labeling of a product), or 
biological product deviations;
    (B) To track FDA-regulated products;
    (C) To enable product recalls, repairs, or replacement, or lookback 
(including locating and notifying individuals who have received products 
that have been recalled, withdrawn, or are the subject of lookback); or
    (D) To conduct post marketing surveillance;
    (iv) A person who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or 
may otherwise be at risk of contracting or spreading a disease or 
condition, if the covered entity or public health authority is 
authorized by law to notify such person as necessary in the conduct of a 
public health intervention or investigation; or
    (v) An employer, about an individual who is a member of the 
workforce of the employer, if:
    (A) The covered entity is a covered health care provider who is a 
member of the workforce of such employer or who provides health care to 
the individual at the request of the employer:
    (1) To conduct an evaluation relating to medical surveillance of the 
workplace; or
    (2) To evaluate whether the individual has a work-related illness or 
injury;
    (B) The protected health information that is disclosed consists of 
findings concerning a work-related illness or injury or a workplace-
related medical surveillance;
    (C) The employer needs such findings in order to comply with its 
obligations, under 29 CFR parts 1904 through 1928, 30 CFR parts 50 
through 90, or under state law having a similar purpose, to record such 
illness or injury or to carry out responsibilities for workplace medical 
surveillance; and
    (D) The covered health care provider provides written notice to the 
individual that protected health information relating to the medical 
surveillance of the workplace and work-related illnesses and injuries is 
disclosed to the employer:
    (1) By giving a copy of the notice to the individual at the time the 
health care is provided; or
    (2) If the health care is provided on the work site of the employer, 
by posting the notice in a prominent place at the location where the 
health care is provided.
    (2) Permitted uses. If the covered entity also is a public health 
authority, the covered entity is permitted to use protected health 
information in all cases

[[Page 734]]

in which it is permitted to disclose such information for public health 
activities under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Standard: Disclosures about victims of abuse, neglect or 
domestic violence. (1) Permitted disclosures. Except for reports of 
child abuse or neglect permitted by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section, a covered entity may disclose protected health information 
about an individual whom the covered entity reasonably believes to be a 
victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to a government 
authority, including a social service or protective services agency, 
authorized by law to receive reports of such abuse, neglect, or domestic 
violence:
    (i) To the extent the disclosure is required by law and the 
disclosure complies with and is limited to the relevant requirements of 
such law;
    (ii) If the individual agrees to the disclosure; or
    (iii) To the extent the disclosure is expressly authorized by 
statute or regulation and:
    (A) The covered entity, in the exercise of professional judgment, 
believes the disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm to the 
individual or other potential victims; or
    (B) If the individual is unable to agree because of incapacity, a 
law enforcement or other public official authorized to receive the 
report represents that the protected health information for which 
disclosure is sought is not intended to be used against the individual 
and that an immediate enforcement activity that depends upon the 
disclosure would be materially and adversely affected by waiting until 
the individual is able to agree to the disclosure.
    (2) Informing the individual. A covered entity that makes a 
disclosure permitted by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must promptly 
inform the individual that such a report has been or will be made, 
except if:
    (i) The covered entity, in the exercise of professional judgment, 
believes informing the individual would place the individual at risk of 
serious harm; or
    (ii) The covered entity would be informing a personal 
representative, and the covered entity reasonably believes the personal 
representative is responsible for the abuse, neglect, or other injury, 
and that informing such person would not be in the best interests of the 
individual as determined by the covered entity, in the exercise of 
professional judgment.
    (d) Standard: Uses and disclosures for health oversight activities. 
(1) Permitted disclosures. A covered entity may disclose protected 
health information to a health oversight agency for oversight activities 
authorized by law, including audits; civil, administrative, or criminal 
investigations; inspections; licensure or disciplinary actions; civil, 
administrative, or criminal proceedings or actions; or other activities 
necessary for appropriate oversight of:
    (i) The health care system;
    (ii) Government benefit programs for which health information is 
relevant to beneficiary eligibility;
    (iii) Entities subject to government regulatory programs for which 
health information is necessary for determining compliance with program 
standards; or
    (iv) Entities subject to civil rights laws for which health 
information is necessary for determining compliance.
    (2) Exception to health oversight activities. For the purpose of the 
disclosures permitted by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a health 
oversight activity does not include an investigation or other activity 
in which the individual is the subject of the investigation or activity 
and such investigation or other activity does not arise out of and is 
not directly related to:
    (i) The receipt of health care;
    (ii) A claim for public benefits related to health; or
    (iii) Qualification for, or receipt of, public benefits or services 
when a patient's health is integral to the claim for public benefits or 
services.
    (3) Joint activities or investigations. Nothwithstanding paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, if a health oversight activity or investigation 
is conducted in conjunction with an oversight activity or investigation
