                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2013), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

    Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of 
the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. 
Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date 
in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected 
(LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to 
the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult 
previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 
2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published 
for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.

[[Page vii]]

    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

INQUIRIES

    For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this 
volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at

    (j) EPA is approving Pennsylvania's request that the 1990 emissions 
inventory for VOCs from R.R. Donnelley & Sons--East Plant be corrected 
to accurately reflect the 1990 emissions. The 1990 baseyear VOC 
emissions inventory will be corrected to 864 tons. Justification for the 
change in VOC emissions is described as follows:
    (1) For rotogravure operations, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (East 
Plant) initially assumed a 5% retention of solvent in the web, and then 
revised their assumption to 2% based on the amount of solvent actually 
being recovered by the six bed carbon adsorption system. Based on VOC 
emissions data submitted to PADEP for the year 1990, the actual VOC 
emissions from rotogravure operations was 794.51 tons. The figures were 
taken from data submitted to PADEP from the facility dated May 6, 1996 
(subsequently submitted to EPA from PADEP via letter dated December 13, 
1996).
    (2) For heatset web offset lithographic operations, boilers, and 
associated solvent cleaning equipment, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company 
provided data calculating estimates for actual 1990 VOC emissions of 
69.83 tons. The figures were taken from the facility's RACT proposal 
submitted to PADEP dated March 29, 1995.
    (k) Rockwell Heavy Vehicle, Inc., New Castle Forge Plant, Lawrence 
County--On April 8, 1998 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental 
Protection requested that EPA include the CO, VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions from this facility in the 1990 base year emission inventory. 
The CO, VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from the natural gas units and 
the spray booth of this facility are hereby approved as part of the 1990 
point source inventory. The 1990 CO, VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
from the natural gas units are 8.3 TPY, 1.2 TPY and 64.2 TPY, 
respectively. The 1990 VOC emissions from the spray booth is 12.1 TPY.
    (l) EPA approves, as a revision to the Pennsylvania State 
Implementation Plan, the 1990 NOx emission inventory for the 
Philadelphia area, submitted on July 31, 1998 by the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Protection. The submittal consists of 1990 
base year point, area, highway, and non-road mobile NOx emissions 
inventories for the five-county Philadelphia area (Bucks, Chester, 
Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia Counties).
    (m) EPA approves the 1990 NO<INF>X</INF> base year emission 
inventory for the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley area, submitted by the 
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on March 22, 1996 
and supplemented on February 18, 1997.
    (n) EPA approves as a revision to the Pennsylvania SIP the 1990 base 
year CO emissions inventory for Southwestern Pennsylvania, including 
Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington and 
Westmoreland counties, submitted by the Secretary of the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Protection on November 12, 1992, and as 
revised on August 17, 2001. This submittal consists of the 1990 base 
year inventory for point, area, off-road, and highway emissions for 
these counties, for the pollutant CO.
    (o) EPA approves as a revision to the Pennsylvania State 
Implementation Plan the 2002 base year emissions inventories for the 
Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-
DE-MD-NJ 1997 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area submitted by the 
Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on 
August 29, 2007 (as formally amended by Pennsylvania on December 10, 
2009 and on April 12, 2010). This submittal consists of the 2002 base 
year point, area, non-road mobile, and on-road mobile source emission 
inventories for this area, for the following pollutants: Volatile 
organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides 
(NO<INF>X</INF>).
    (p) EPA approves as a revision to the Pennsylvania State 
Implementation Plan the 2002 base year emissions inventory for the 
Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley 1997 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) 
nonattainment area submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of 
Environmental Protection on November 10, 2009. The base year emissions 
inventory includes emissions estimates that cover the general source 
categories of point sources, area sources, on-road mobile sources, and 
non-road mobile sources. The pollutants that comprise

[[Page 70]]

the inventory are PM<INF>2.5</INF>, coarse particles (PM<INF>10</INF>), 
nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 
ammonia (NH<INF>3</INF>), and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>).

Sec. 52.2037  Control strategy plans for attainment and 
rate-of-progress: Ozone.

    (a) Part D--Conditional Approval--the Pennsylvania plan for carbon 
monoxide and ozone is approved provided that the following conditions 
are satisfied:
    (1) Firm commitments to implement the Newton Branch electrification 
are submitted to EPA by December 30, 1980. If firm commitments are not 
submitted, the State must submit substitute measures with equivalent 
reductions by June 30, 1981.
    (b)(1) [Reserved]
    (2) Determination--EPA has determined that, as of July 19, 1995, the 
Reading ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and 
that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration 
requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 
172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to this area for so long as 
the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a 
violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Reading ozone 
nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
    (c) VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> RACT determination for six emission units 
at U.S. Steel--Fairless: no. 3 blast furnace, no. 1 open hearth furnace, 
no. 1 soaking pits, no. 2 soaking pits (units 1-8), no. 2 soaking pits 
(units 9-16), 80 in. hot strip mill. The NO<INF>X</INF> RACT 
determination for all the soaking pits and the 80 in. hot strip mill is 
low excess air (LEA), which is expected to result in a 13.5% emission 
reduction. NO<INF>X</INF> RACT for the other sources is determined to be 
good operating practices to minimize NO<INF>X</INF> emissions. VOC RACT 
for all the above sources is determined to be good operating practices 
to minimize VOC emissions.
    (d) NO<INF>X</INF> RACT determination for the no. 2 glass melting 
furnace and the four kilns at the General Glass--Jeannette plant, which 
manufactured flat glass, is the current operation, consisting of no

Sec. 52.2072  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Rhode Island's plan, as identified in Sec. 52.2070 of this 
subpart, for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards 
under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator 
finds the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the 
Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, 
continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone 
portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT 
requirements by January 1, 1981 for the sources covered by CTGs issued 
between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each 
subsequent January as additional RACT requirements for sources covered 
by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) 
provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of 
greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that 
application only to the extent that GHGs are ``subject to regulation'', 
as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action 
on that application to the extent that GHGs are not ``subject to 
regulation.''
    (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to 
regulation if:
    (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a 
regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will 
have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; or
    (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source 
for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an 
emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions 
increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; and,
    (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be 
subject to regulation:
    (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential 
to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e; or
    (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the 
potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, when such stationary 
source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation 
that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e 
or more.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)--
    (i) the term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 
40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: 
Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
    (ii) The term tpy CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent emissions 
(CO<INF>2</INF>e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall 
be computed as follows:
    (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the 
six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated 
global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR 
part 98--Global Warming Potentials.
    (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this 
section for each gas to compute a tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (iii) the term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant 
emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 9.1.1 of Rhode 
Island's Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 9) and a significant net 
emissions increase (as defined in 9.1.24 and 9.1.34 of Rhode Island's 
Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 9) occur. For

[[Page 151]]

the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy 
CO<INF>2</INF>e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is 
a regulated NSR pollutant, and ``significant'' is defined as 75,000 tpy 
CO<INF>2</INF>e instead of applying the value for ``any other 
pollutant'' in 9.1.34 of Rhode Island's Air Pollution Control Regulation 
No. 9.

Sec. 52.2073  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide for public availability of emission 
data.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data.
    (1) Information obtained from owner or operators of stationary 
sources pursuant to Sec. 52.2075 will be correlated with applicable 
emission limitations and other control regulations and will be made 
available for public inspection at the Rhode Island Department of 
Health, 204 Health Building, Providence, RI.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2074  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(e) of this chapter are not met. 
Authority to require recordkeeping is deficient to the extent that 
section 23-25-13 requires only those sources with an air pollution 
control program to keep records.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met. 
Authority to release emission data to the public is deficient in that 
section 23-25-6 requires that only records concerning investigations be 
available to the public. Further, section 23-25-5(g) and section 23-25-
13 may limit the State's authority to release emission data. Authority 
to require sources to install and maintain monitoring equipment is not 
provided and is therefore inadequate. Authority to require sources to 
periodically report is not provided and is therefore inadequate.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2075  Source surveillance.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.211 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan lacks adequate legal authority to require owners or 
operators of stationary sources to maintain records of, and periodically 
report information as may be necessary to enable the state to determine 
whether such sources are in compliance with applicable portions of the 
control strategy.
    (b) Regulation for source recordkeeping and reporting.
    (1) The owner or operator of all stationary sources which have the 
potential to emit a total of 100 tons or more per year of any one air 
contaminant for which there is a national standard shall maintain 
records of, and submit to the Director, data on operational processes, 
fuel usage, emission, stack parameters, boiler capacities, types of 
equipment generating air contaminants and air contaminant control 
devices that may be necessary to determine if the source is in 
compliance with applicable rules and regulations of the Department. Upon 
notification of the Administrator, or the Director of the Rhode Island 
Department of Health, sources with the potential to emit less than 100 
tons per year of any air contaminant shall also be subject to the 
requirements of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, 
potential emissions shall be calculated at the design load assuming no 
control equipment is in use and fuel having a sulfur content of 2.2 
percent by weight (dry basis) is being burned.
    (2) The information recorded by the owner or operator of a 
stationary source shall be summarized and reported to the Director of 
the Department of Health on forms furnished by him. They shall be 
submitted within 30 days following the end of the reporting period. 
Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of the 
summarizing reports submitted to the Director shall be retained by the 
owner or operator for two years after the date on which the pertinent 
report is submitted.

Sec. 52.2084  Rules and regulations.

    (a) Part D--Disapproval.
    (1) On November 5, 1985, the Rhode Island Department of 
Environmental Management submitted a revision to the Rhode Island State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkwright Incorporated. This revision is 
an alternative reasonably available control technology determination for 
the control of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from three paper coating 
lines at Arkwright Incorporated's Fiskeville, Rhode Island facility. As 
a result of EPA's disapproval of this revision, the existing VOC rules 
applicable to Arkwright Incorporated and contained in the Rhode Island 
SIP remain in effect (Rhode Island Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 
19 as approved by EPA in 40 CFR 52.2080(c)(19)).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Non-Part D--No Action-- EPA is neither approving nor 
disapproving the following elements of the revisions:
    (i) [Reserved]
    (ii) Consultation.
    (iii) Permit fees.
    (iv) Stack height requirements.
    (v) Public notification.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2085  Stack height review.

    The State of Rhode Island has declared to the satisfaction of EPA 
that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height 
credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited 
dispersion technique as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as 
revised on July 8, 1985. Such declarations were submitted to EPA on 
March 27, 1986. The State has further declared, in letters from Thomas 
D. Getz, dated October 15, 1985 and March 27, 1986, that ``[R]hode 
Island will use the 8 July 1985 revised height regulations in 
administering section 9.18 of its new source review regulations.'' Thus, 
Rhode Island has satisfactorily demonstrated that its

[[Page 159]]

regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2086  Emission inventories.

    (a) The Governor's designee for the State of Rhode Island submitted 
the 1990 base year emission inventory for the Providence ozone 
nonattainment area on January 12, 1993 as a revision to the State 
Implementation Plan (SIP). The 1990 base year emission inventory 
requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 
1990, has been satisfied for this area.
    (b) The inventory is for the ozone precursors which are volatile 
organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventory 
covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic 
sources.
    (c) The Providence nonattainment area is classified as serious and 
includes the entire state of Rhode Island.
    (d) Minor revisions to the Rhode Island 1990 base year emission 
inventory were submitted to EPA on September 21, 1998. The revised 
emission estimates were prepared in accordance with EPA guidance, and 
are approved into the State's SIP.
    (e) The state of Rhode Island submitted base year emission 
inventories representing emissions for calendar year 2002 from the 
Providence moderate ozone nonattainment area on April 30, 2008 as 
revisions to the State's SIP. The 2002 base year emission inventory 
requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 
1990, has been satisfied for this area. The inventory consists of 
emission estimates of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, 
and cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile and biogenic 
sources. The inventory was submitted as a revision to the SIP in partial 
fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 1997 8-
hour ozone standard.

Sec. 52.2088  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the 
Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on September 21, 
1998. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of 
progress requirement of section 182(c)(2)(B), and the contingency 
measure requirements of section 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the 
Providence serious ozone nonattainment area.
    (b) Approval--Revisions to the state implementation plan submitted 
by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on March 24, 
2003. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the one-hour ozone 
attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the 
Clean Air Act, for the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area. 
The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007 
for the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area, and approves the 
contingency measures

[[Page 168]]

for purposes of attainment. This revision establishes motor vehicle 
emissions budgets for 2007 of 30.68 tons per day of volatile organic 
compounds and 33.97 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in 
transportation conformity in the Rhode Island serious ozone 
nonattainment area. Rhode Island also commits to conduct a mid-course 
review to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved towards the 
goal of attainment by 2007, and to submit the results to EPA by December 
31, 2004.
    (c) Determination of Attainment. Effective July 6, 2010, EPA is 
determining that the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone 
nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under 
the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), 
this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and 
attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related 
requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as 
the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone 
standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the 
Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this 
determination shall no longer apply.
    (d) Determination of Attainment. Effective November 22, 2010, EPA is 
determining that the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone 
nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard based on 
2007-2009 monitoring data. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone 
implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the 
reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of 
section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the 
Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of 
the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS 
is monitored in the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone 
nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In 
addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 
1997 ozone standard.
    (e) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the 
Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on April 30, 2008. 
The revision is for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress 
requirement of section 182(b)(1) from 2002 through 2008, and the 
contingency measure requirement of sections 172(c)(9) and of the Clean 
Air Act, for the Providence moderate ozone nonattainment area. The 
revision establishes motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 of 24.64 
tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 28.26 tons per day of 
nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the 
Providence moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.

Sec. 52.2089  Control strategy: carbon monoxide.

    (a) Approval--On September 22, 2008, the Rhode Island Department of 
Environmental Management submitted a request to establish a limited 
maintenance plan for the Providence Rhode Island carbon monoxide 
attainment area for the remainder of the second ten-year maintenance 
plan. The State of Rhode Island has committed to year round carbon 
monoxide monitoring at the East Providence Photochemical Assessment 
Monitoring Station (PAMS) site; re-establishing downtown Providence CO 
monitoring if criteria specified in the Limited Maintenance Plan are 
triggered; and, ensuring that project-level carbon monoxide evaluations 
of transportation projects in the maintenance area are conducted. The 
limited maintenance plan satisfies all applicable requirements of 
section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Approval of a limited maintenance 
plan is conditioned on maintaining levels of ambient carbon monoxide 
levels below the required limited maintenance plan 8-hour carbon 
monoxide design value criterion of 7.65 parts per million. If the 
Limited Maintenance Plan criterion is no longer satisfied, Rhode Island 
must develop a full maintenance plan to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

Sec. 52.2122  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves South Carolina's plans for the attainment and maintenance of 
the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. 
Furthermore the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements 
of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as 
noted elsewhere in this subpart. In addition, continued satisfaction of 
the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on 
the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the 
sources covered by CTG's issued between January 1978 and January 1979 
and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT 
requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) EPA disapproved South Carolina's generic bubble regulation 
submitted for approval into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on June 
5, 1985.
    (c)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) 
provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of 
greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that 
application only to the extent that GHGs are ``subject to regulation'', 
as provided in this paragraph (c), and the Administrator takes no action 
on that application to the extent that GHGs are not ``subject to 
regulation.''
    (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to 
regulation if:
    (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a 
regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will 
have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; or
    (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source 
for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an 
emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions 
increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; and,
    (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be 
subject to regulation:
    (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential 
to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e; or
    (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the 
potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, when such stationary 
source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation 
that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e 
or more.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (c)--
    (i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 
40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: 
Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
    (ii) The term tpy CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent emissions 
(CO<INF>2</INF>e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall 
be computed as follows:
    (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the 
six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated 
global warming potential published at Table

[[Page 174]]

A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98--Global Warming Potentials.
    (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this 
section for each gas to compute a tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant

Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards (South Carolina

being disapproved. The remainder of this regulatory provision is being 
approved); (x); (y) and (z).
    (e) Regulation 61-62.5 Standard No. 7.1--EPA is disapproving two 
provisions of South Carolina's NNSR program (submitted on July 1, 2005) 
that relate to provisions that were vacated from the federal program by 
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
on June 24, 2005. The two provisions vacated from the federal rules 
pertain to Pollution Control Projects (PCPs) and clean units. The PCP 
and clean unit references are severable from the remainder of the NNSR 
program. Specifically, the following sections of South Carolina 
Regulation 61-62.5 Standard No. 7.1 are being disapproved: (b)(5); 
(b)(6)--Second sentence only; (b)(8); (c)(4); (c)(6)(C)(viii);

    (d) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met 
since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or 
operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or 
combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions 
of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance 
of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

Sec. 52.2125  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined, as of 
November 15, 2011, the bi-state Charlotte-Gastonia-Rockhill, North 
Carolina-South Carolina nonattainment area has attaining data for the 
1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 
51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment 
demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a 
reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other 
planning SIPs related to attainment of the

[[Page 175]]

standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour 
ozone NAAQS.
    (b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year 
period 2008-2010, EPA determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, 
North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area 
attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date 
of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA 
section 181(b)(2) to determine, based on the Area's air quality as of 
the attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also 
determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South 
Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area is not subject to the 
consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 181(b)(2).

Sec. 52.2126  VOC rule deficiency correction.

    Sections I and II of South Carolina's Regulations 62.1 and 62.5 is 
approved. The State submitted these regulations to EPA for approval on 
September 18, 1990. Sections I and II of Regulation 62.5 were intended 
to correct deficiencies cited in a letter calling for the State to 
revise its SIP for ozone from Mr. Greer C. Tidwell, the EPA Regional 
Administrator, to Governor Carroll A. Campbell on May 26, 1988, and 
clarified in a letter from Mr. Winston A. Smith, EPA Region IV, Air, 
Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, to Mr. Otto E. Pearson, 
former Director of the South Carolina Department of Health and 
Environmental Control:
    (a) South Carolina's VOC regulations contain no method for 
determining capture efficiency. This deficiency must be corrected after 
EPA publishes guidance on the methods for determining capture efficiency 
before the SIP for ozone can be fully approved.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2172  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves South Dakota's plan as meeting the requirements of section 110 
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977. Furthermore, the Administrator 
finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D of the Clean 
Air Act, as amended in 1977.
    (b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) 
provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of 
greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that 
application only to the extent that GHGs are ``subject to regulation'', 
as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action 
on that application to the extent that GHGs are not ``subject to 
regulation.''
    (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to 
regulation if:
    (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a 
regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will 
have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; or
    (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source 
for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an 
emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions 
increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; and,
    (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be 
subject to regulation:
    (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential 
to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e; or
    (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the 
potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, when such stationary 
source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation 
that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e 
or more.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)--
    (i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 
40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate

[[Page 187]]

group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
    (ii) The term tpy CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent emissions 
(CO<INF>2</INF>e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall 
be computed as follows:
    (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the 
six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated 
global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR 
part 98--Global Warming Potentials.
    (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this 
section for each gas to compute a tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant 
emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 40 CFR 
52.21(a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in 
paragraphs 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and (b)(23)(i)) occur. For the pollutant 
GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, and 
shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR 
pollutant, and ``significant'' is defined as 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e 
instead of applying the value in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(ii).

Sec. 52.2173  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met 
since the South Dakota Compiled Law 34-16A-21 provides that data which 
relates to processes or production unique to the owner or which tend to 
adversely affect a competitive position of the owner shall be held 
confidential.
    (b) Delegation of authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, 
South Dakota requested a delegation of authority to enable it to 
collect, correlate and release emission data to the public. The 
Administrator has determined that South Dakota is qualified to receive a 
delegation of the authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator 
delegates to South Dakota his authority under sections 114(a) (1) and 
(2) and section 114(c) of the Act, i.e., authority to collect, 
correlate, and release emission data to the public.

apply to sources proposing to construct on Indian reservations;
    (b) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air 
quality. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are 
hereby incorporated and made a part of the South Dakota State

response to the NRDC remand modifies the July 8, 1985 regulations, EPA 
will notify the State of the rules that must be changed to comport with 
the EPA's modified requirements. The State of South Dakota agrees to 
make the appropriate changes.''

    The revisions to the variance provisions in Chapter 74:26:01:31.01 
of the South Dakota Air Pollution Control Program, which were submitted 
by the Governor's designee on September 25, 1991, are disapproved 
because they are inconsistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, 
which prohibits any state or EPA from granting a variance from any 
requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to a 
stationary source.

Dakota minor source operating permits, which are issued in accordance 
with ARSD 74:36:04 and which are submitted to EPA in a timely manner in 
both proposed and final form, shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves 
the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a 
determination will be made according to appropriate procedures and will 
be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit 
requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program 
requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.

enforceable measures contained in CAA section 128(a)(1), EPA 
conditionally approved TDEC's March 28, 2012, commitment on June 25, 
2012. Tennessee must submit to EPA by July 23, 2013, SIP revisions 
adopting specific enforceable measures related to CAA sections 128(a)(1) 
as described in the State's letter of commitment.
    (c) Conditional Approval--Submittal from the State of Tennessee, 
through the Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), dated 
October 4, 2012, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) sections 
110(a)(2)(C), prong 3 of 110(a)(2)(D)(i), and 110(a)(2)(J) for the 2008 
8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. EPA is 
conditionally approving TDEC's submittal with respect to the PSD 
requirements of CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), prong 3 of 110(a)(2)(D)(i), 
and 110(a)(2)(J), specifically related to the adoption of enforceable 
provisions for PSD increments as detailed in TDEC's October 4, 2012, 
commitment letter. Tennessee must submit to EPA by March 6, 2014, a SIP 
revision adopting specific enforceable measures related to PSD 
increments as described in the State's letter of commitment.
    (d) Conditional Approval--Submittal from the State of Tennessee, 
through the Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), dated 
October 19, 2009, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) section 
110(a)(2)(E)(ii) for the 2008 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards. With respect to CAA section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii), specifically 
related to the adoption of enforceable measures contained in CAA section 
128(a)(1), EPA published in the Federal Register a final rulemaking to 
conditionally approve TDEC's March 28, 2012, commitment on July 23, 
2012. Tennessee must submit to EPA by July 23, 2013, SIP revisions 
adopting specific enforceable measures related to CAA sections 128(a)(1) 
as described in the State's letter of commitment.
    (e) Conditional Approval. On October 4, 2012, Tennessee submitted a 
commitment letter to EPA requesting conditional approval of specific 
enforceable measures related to prong 3 of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i); 
specifically, the PM<INF>2.5</INF> PSD Increment-SILs-SMC Rule (only as 
it relates to PM<INF>2.5</INF> increments) for the 1997 annual and 2006 
24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air 
quality standards. EPA is conditionally approving Tennessee's commitment 
to address outstanding requirements promulgated in the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
PSD Increment-SILs-SMC Rule (only as it relates to PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
increments). If

[[Page 193]]

Tennessee fails to submit these revisions by March 6, 2014, the 
conditional approval will automatically become a disapproval on that 
date and EPA will issue a finding of disapproval.

Sec. 52.2222  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Tennessee's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans thus far submitted satisfy all 
requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1977, except as noted below.

In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for 
the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of 
RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the sources covered by CTGs 
issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and on adoption and 
submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for 
sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) New source review permits issued pursuant to section 173 of the 
Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of 
Section V of the emission offset interpretative rule (Appendix S of 40 
CFR part 51) are met.
    (c) EPA approves Nashville/Davidson County, Tennessee's VOC 
Regulation No. 7, Section 7-1(11), which replaces the definition of 
Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) with a definition for VOC that is 
consistent with the EPA approved definition. The EPA approved definition 
defines VOC as any organic compound that participates in atmospheric 
photochemical reactions. However, it excludes organic compounds which 
have negligible photochemical reactivity. These compounds are as 
follows: methane, ethane, methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane), 
CFC-113

[[Page 211]]

(trichlorotrifluoroethane), methylene chloride, CFC 11 
(trichlorofluoromethane), CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), CFC-22 
(chlorodifluoromethane), FC-23 (trifluoromethane), CFC-114 
(dichlorotetrafluoroethane), CFC-115 (chloropentafluoroethane). It is 
also our understanding that by adopting the EPA approved definition, 
Nashville/Davidson County, Tennessee will use EPA approved test methods 
for VOC.

Sec. 52.2224  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide the legal authority for controlling 
motor vehicles during air pollution emergency episodes.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met 
since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or 
operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or 
combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions 
of any air pollutant at any location which

[[Page 220]]

will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not 
adequate.
    (c)(1) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(b) of this chapter are not 
met since the definition of person set forth in the Tennessee Air 
Quality Act and in the State implementation plan does not include 
facilities owned or operated by the State. Therefore, section 53-3409(f) 
of the Tennessee Code Annotated and section 30 of Chapter II of the 
Tennessee Air Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved.
    (2) Definition of person. For the purposes of the plan, person shall 
mean any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, 
corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, State-
owned or operated facility, State agency, political subdivision, or any 
other legal entity, or their legal representatives, agents, or assigns.
    (d) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met 
since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of 
House Bill 1490 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions 
from the quarrying and processing of agricultural limestone. Therefore, 
section 53-3424 of the Tennessee Code Annotated is disapproved.
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met 
since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of 
House Bill 1845 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions 
from air contaminant sources which use woodwaste only as fuel. 
Therefore, the last sentence of section 53-3422 of the Tennessee Code 
Annotated is disapproved.

Sec. 52.2225  VOC rule deficiency correction.

    (a) Revisions to sections 7-3, 7-13, and 7-24 of the Tennessee 
regulations are approved. These amendments are in response to the Clean 
Air Act section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement to submit RACT rules correcting 
deficiencies in the existing SIP in accordance with EPA's pre-amendment 
guidance. These deficiencies were first noted in a letter from Greer 
Tidwell, the EPA Region IV Administrator, to Governor McWherter on May 
26, 1988, and clarified in a letter dated June 10, 1988, from Winston 
Smith, EPA Region IV Air Division Director, to Paul Bontrager, Director 
of the Air Pollution Control Division of the Metropolitan Health 
Department for Nashville/Davidson County, and were further identified in 
EPA guidance including the Blue Book and the proposed Post-87 policy. 
The following deficiency in the Tennessee Regulations, however, has not 
been corrected.
    (1) Section 7-25, ``Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements'' 
Nashville/Davidson County committed in a letter dated May 7, 1991, to 
include a separate provision that requires records to be maintained for 
at least two years. This additional provision, which is scheduled for a 
July 15, 1992, public hearing, will be submitted to EPA shortly after 
that date and will be acted upon separately.
    (2) In Section 7-3, Petition for Alternative Controls, the words 
``as applied'' should be added to the term ``VOC/gallon solids'' as a 
clarification.
    (3) The term ``vapor-tight'' should be defined in section 7-13.
    (4) ``Once-in/always-in'' is missing from the applicability section 
of the individual rules.
    (5) Section 7-25, ``Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements'' 
should be revised to include additional requirements that would contain: 
units of compliance consistent with the performance requirements; 
applicable time periods for data entries; and a clear, separate 
provision that requires records to be kept.

maintain the secondary ambient standard for particulate matter in the 
Chattanooga, Columbia, Kingsport, Memphis, and Nashville nonattainment 
areas (40 CFR 81.343).

Sec. 52.2227  Prevention of air pollution emergency episodes.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.152(a) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide for the enforcement of emission control 
actions for mobile sources during air pollution emergency episodes.

Sec. 52.2228  Review of new sources and modifications.

    (a) Part D--Conditional approval. The Nashville-Davidson County 
regulation for the review of new sources and modifications in 
nonattainment areas is approved on condition that the State by October 
31, 1984, submit a revision limiting source shutdown credit for offsets 
to replacement units, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the 
regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
    (b) Section 123--Conditional approval. The plan's provision for 
implementation of the requirements of section 123 of the Clean Air Act 
in Nashville-Davidson County is approved on condition that the State by 
October 31, 1984, submit:
    (1) Definitions in the local regulation of nearby and excessive 
concentration and
    (2) Provision in the local regulation for public notification and 
opportunity for hearing in cases where stack heights in excess of normal 
good engineering practice are proposed on the basis of fluid modeling 
demonstrations, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the local 
regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
    (c) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete section 1200-3-18-.03 
``Standard for New Sources'' from the Tennessee State Implementation 
Plan (SIP) and the Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP. 
EPA is disapproving the deletion of this rule for the Tennessee SIP 
because Tennessee does not have federally approved New Source Review 
(NSR) regulations which apply to some of the sources in this chapter. 
EPA is approving the deletion of this rule for the Memphis submittal 
because the federally approved TN NSR applies to the Memphis-Shelby 
County area.
    (d) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete rule 1200-3-18-.03 
``Standard for New Sources'' from the Tennessee State Implementation 
Plan (SIP). In paragraph (e) of this section, EPA disapproved the 
deletion of this rule because Tennessee did not have federally approved 
New Source Review (NSR) regulations that applied to some of the sources 
in this chapter. EPA is hereby approving the deletion of section 1200-3-
18-.03 of the Tennessee SIP, and is deleting EPA's earlier disapproval 
in paragraph (e) of this section.

Sec. 52.2231  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

    (a) Part D conditional approval. The Chattanooga primary TSP plan's 
provisions for review of new sources and modifications in the 
nonattainment area are approved on condition that the State submit by 
December 31, 1987, a definition of the term Federally enforceable and 
provisions for making Federally enforceable all limitations, conditions, 
and offsets, including permit restrictions, relied upon under the plan, 
and in the interim, implement these provisions in a manner consistent 
with EPA requirements.
    (b) In letters dated March 9 and April 15, 1988, the Tennessee 
Department of Health and Environment certified that no emission limits 
in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by 
EPA's stack height rules. This certification does not apply to: Dupont

[[Page 223]]

the Chattanooga, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for 
the 1997 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. This determination, in 
accordance with 40 CFR 52.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this 
area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably 
available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, 
contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of 
the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.
    (d) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined the 
Knoxville, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 
annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 
CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an 
attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control 
measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and 
other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as 
this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.
    (e) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined Knoxville-
Sevierville-La Follette, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining 
data for the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. This determination, in 
accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this 
area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably 
available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, 
contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of 
the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2006 24-hour

Sec. 52.2232  Determination of attainment.

    Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year 
period 2007-2009, EPA determined that the Chattanooga, Alabama-Georgia-
Tennessee PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment Area attained the 1997 annual 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 
2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 
179(c) to determine, based on the Area's air quality as of the 
attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also 
determined that the Chattanooga, Alabama-Georgia-Tennessee 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment Area is not subject to the consequences 
of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).

Sec. 52.2233  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a)(1) Paragraph 1200-3-9-.01(4)-(0)-2. of Tennessee's regulations 
is disapproved because it does not require that the consent of the 
Governor(s) of affected states be obtained when innovative technology 
waivers are granted. EPA retains permitting authority for sources 
requesting innovative technology waivers which would significantly 
impact air quality in adjacent states.
    (2) Tennessee's definition of stationary source specifically 
excludes the activities of any Vessel. This exclusion is not currently 
approvable and EPA is deferring action on it pending final rulemaking on 
the issue. EPA retains authority for permits which involve vessel 
emissions where a source is not willing to include all vessel emissions 
in the definition of source.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are 
hereby incorporated and made part of the applicable SIP for the State of 
Tennessee for the following purposes:
    (1) Permitting of sources requesting innovative technology waivers 
which would significantly impact air quality in adjacent states.
    (2) Permitting of sources involving vessel emissions where the 
source is unwilling to include all vessel emissions in the definition of 
source.

Sec. 52.2234  Visibility protection.

    (a) Regional Haze. The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air 
Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by Tennessee on 
April 4, 2008, does not include fully approvable measures for meeting 
the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3) and 51.308(e) with respect to 
emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> from electric generating 
units. EPA has given limited approval and limited disapproval to the 
plan provisions addressing these requirements.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Measures Addressing Limited Disapproval Associated with NOX. The 
deficiencies associated with NO<INF>X</INF> identified in EPA's limited 
disapproval of the regional haze plan submitted by Tennessee on April 4, 
2008, are satisfied by Sec. 52.2240.
    (d) Measures Addressing Limited Disapproval Associated with SO2. The 
deficiencies associated with SO<INF>2</INF> identified in EPA's limited 
disapproval of the regional haze plan submitted by Tennessee on April 4, 
2008, are satisfied by Sec. 52.2241.

Sec. 52.2235  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Determination--EPA is determining that, as of August 8, 1995, 
the Nashville ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard 
and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration 
requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 
172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as 
the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a 
violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Nashville ozone 
nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
    (b) Nonregulatory provisions for the implementation of a basic I/M 
program in Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties, 
submitted on July 13, 1994, were approved by EPA on September 26, 1995.
    (c) Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of 
October 12, 2010 the Knoxville, Tennessee nonattainment area has 
attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in 
accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area 
to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available 
control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency 
measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards 
for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

75 FR 62472, Oct. 12, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2236  Control strategy; lead.

    (a) The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation has 
submitted revisions to the Tennessee SIP on October 6, 1994. These 
revisions address the requirements necessary to change a lead 
nonattainment area to attainment. The maintenance plan for the Fayette 
County area near Rossville, Tennessee is comprised of a maintenance 
demonstration and NSR/PSD program. For areas where the only lead source 
has shut down, these components are sufficient for an approvable 
maintenance plan. The State's maintenance plan is complete and satisfies 
all of the requirements of section 175(A) of the CAA.
    (b) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined the Bristol, 
Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 2008 lead (Pb) 
NAAQS. This clean data determination suspends the requirements for this 
area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably 
available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, 
contingency measures,

[[Page 225]]

and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as 
long as this area continues to meet the 2008 Pb NAAQS.

Sec. 52.2237  NOX RACT and NOX conformity exemption.

    Approval. EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT) and 
NO<INF>X</INF> conformity exemption request submitted by the Tennessee 
Department of Environment and Conservation on March 21, 1995, for the 
five county middle Tennessee (Nashville) ozone moderate nonattainment 
area. This approval exempts the area from implementing federal 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT on major sources of NO<INF>X</INF> and exempts 
Tennessee from NO<INF>X</INF> conformity. This approval does not exempt 
sources from any State required or State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
approved NO<INF>X</INF> controls. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS 
occurs in the area, the exemption from the requirement of section 182(f) 
of the CAA in the applicable area shall not apply.

Sec. 52.2240  Interstate pollutant transport provisions; What are 
the FIP requirements for decreases in emissions of nitrogen oxides?

    (a)(1) The owner and operator of each source located within the 
State of Tennessee and for which requirements are set forth under the 
Federal CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program in subparts AA 
through II of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such applicable 
requirements. The obligation to comply with these requirements in part 
97 of this chapter will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval 
by the Administrator of a revision to the Tennessee State Implementation 
Plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
relating to NO<INF>X</INF> under Sec. 51.123 of this chapter, except to 
the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional or 
unless such approval is under Sec. 51.123(p) of this chapter.
    (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the 
Administrator has already allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this 
chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for those years shall continue to apply, 
unless the Administrator approves a SIP provision that provides for the 
allocation of the remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for those 
years.
    (b)(1) The owner and operator of each NO<INF>X</INF> source located 
within the State of Tennessee and for which requirements are set forth 
under the Federal CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program in 
subparts AAAA through IIII of part 97 of this chapter must comply with 
such applicable requirements. The obligation to comply with these 
requirements in part 97 of this chapter will be eliminated by the 
promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to the 
Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of 
CAIR for ozone relating to NO<INF>X</INF> under Sec. 51.123 of this 
chapter, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or 
conditional or unless such approval is under Sec. 51.123(ee) of this

provision that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances for those years.
    (c) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section and subparts AA through II and AAAA through IIII of part 97 of 
this chapter to the contrary:
    (1) With regard to any control period that begins after December 31, 
2011,
    (i) The provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
relating to NO<INF>X</INF> annual or ozone season emissions shall not be

    (2) The Administrator will not deduct for excess emissions any CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances or CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
allocated for 2012 or any year thereafter;
    (3) By November 7, 2011, the Administrator will remove from the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System accounts all CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated for a control period in 2012 and any 
subsequent year, and, thereafter, no holding or surrender of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances will be required with regard to emissions or 
excess emissions for such control periods; and
    (4) By November 7, 2011, the Administrator will remove from the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Allowance Tracking System accounts all CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances allocated for a control period in 
2012 and any subsequent year, and, thereafter, no holding or surrender 
of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances will be required with 
regard to emissions or excess emissions for such control periods.

described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator has 
already started recording any allocations of TR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual 
allowances under subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter to units in 
the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart 
AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to 
complete the allocation and recordation of TR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual 
allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall 
continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the

Sec. 52.2274  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.

[39 FR 34537, Sept. 26, 1974, as amended at 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2275  Control strategy and regulations: Ozone.

    (a) Section 510.3 of revised Regulation V, which was submitted by 
the Governor on July 20, 1977, is disapproved.
    (b) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Texas 
Implementation Plan, the control measures listed in paragraph (d) of 
this section shall be implemented in accordance with the schedule set 
forth below.
    (c)(1) Removal from service of a 12,000 BPD vacuum distillation unit 
at the Corpus Christi refinery of the Champlin Petroleum Company, Corpus 
Christi, Texas, with a final compliance date no later than October 1, 
1979. This shall result in an estimated hydrocarbon emission reduction 
of at least 139 tons per year.
    (2) Dedication of gasoline storage tank 91-TK-3 located at the 
Corpus Christi refinery of the Champlin Petroleum Company, Corpus 
Christi, Texas to the exclusive storage of No. 2 Fuel Oil or any fluid 
with a vapor pressure equivalent to, or less than that of No. 2 Fuel 
Oil, with a final compliance date no later than October 1, 1979. This 
shall result in an estimated hydrocarbon emission reduction of at least 
107.6 tons per year.
    (d) Determinations that Certain Areas Did Not Attain the 1-Hour 
Ozone NAAQS. EPA has determined that the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria 
severe-17 1-hour ozone nonattainment area did not attain the 1-hour 
ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007. This 
determination bears on the area's obligations with respect to 
implementation of two specific 1-hour ozone standard anti-backsliding 
requirements: section 172(c)(9) contingency measures for failure to 
attain and sections 182(d)(3) and 185 major stationary source fee 
programs.
    (e) Approval--The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) 
submitted a revision to the Texas SIP on February 18, 2003, concerning 
the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance plan. This SIP revision was 
adopted by TCEQ on February 5, 2003. This SIP revision satisfies the 
Clean Air Act requirement, as amended in 1990, for the second 10-year 
update to the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance area.
    (f) Determination of attainment. Effective November 17, 2008 EPA has 
determined that the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) 1-hour ozone nonattainment 
area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of 
EPA's Clean Data Policy, this determination suspends the requirements 
for this area to submit an attainment demonstration or 5% increment of 
progress plan, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, 
and other State Implementation Plans related to attainment of the 1-hour 
ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1-hour ozone 
NAAQS.
    (g) Approval. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) 
submitted a 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of El 
Paso County on January 20, 2006. The area is designated unclassifiable/
attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. EPA determined this 
request for El Paso County was complete on June 13, 2006. The 
maintenance plan meets the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act and is consistent with EPA's maintenance plan guidance 
document dated May 20, 2005. The EPA therefore approved the 1997 8-hour 
ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of El Paso County on January 
15, 2009.
    (h) Determination of attainment for the 1-hour ozone standard and 
redesignation for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Effective November 19, 
2010, EPA has determined that the Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone 
nonattainment area has attained

[[Page 297]]

the 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and has 
redesignated the area to attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. 
With this final redesignation to attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone 
NAAQS and this final determination of attainment for the 1-hour ozone 
NAAQS, the 1-hour anti-backsliding obligations to submit planning SIPs 
to meet the attainment demonstration and reasonably available control 
measures (RACM) requirements, and the ROP and contingency measures 
requirements, cease to apply.

    (b) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Texas 
Implementation Plan, the control measures listed in paragraph (c) of 
this section shall be implemented in accordance with the schedule set 
forth below.
    (c) No later than January 1, 1980, Parker Brothers and Co., Inc., at 
its limestone quarry facilities near New Braunfels, Comal County, Texas 
shall install fabric filters on the primary crusher and on the secondary 
crusher and screens, meeting the requirements of Appendix A of the Texas 
Air Control Board Order 78-8 adopted August 11, 1978. After the date of 
installation of the fabric filters, Parker Brothers and Co., Inc., shall 
not emit particulate matter in excess of 0.03 grains per standard cubic 
foot from the exhaust stack of the fabric filter on its primary crusher 
and shall not emit particulate matter in excess of 0.03 grains per 
standard cubic foot from the exhaust stack of the fabric filter on its 
secondary crusher and screens.

SIP.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, if, at the time of the approval of Texas' SIP revision 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator has 
already started recording any allocations of TR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual 
allowances under subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter to units in 
the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart 
AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to 
complete the allocation and recordation of TR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual 
allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall 
continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the 
State's SIP revision.

Sec. 52.2284  Interstate pollutant transport provisions; What are the 
FIP requirements for decreases in emissions of sulfur dioxide?

    (a) The owner and operator of each SO<INF>2</INF> source located 
within the State of Texas and for which requirements are set forth under 
the Federal CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program in subparts AAA through 
III of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such applicable 
requirements. The obligation to comply with these requirements in part 
97 of this chapter will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval 
by the Administrator of a revision to the Texas State Implementation 
Plan as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM<INF>2.5</INF> relating 
to SO<INF>2</INF> under Sec. 51.124 of this chapter, except to the 
extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional or unless 
such approval is under Sec. 51.124(r) of this chapter.
    (b) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
and subparts AAA through III of part 97 of this chapter and any State's 
SIP to the contrary:
    (1) With regard to any control period that begins after December 31, 
2011,
    (i) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
SO<INF>2</INF> emissions shall not be applicable; and
    (ii) The Administrator will not carry out any of the functions set 
forth for the Administrator in subparts AAA through III of part 97 of 
this chapter; and
    (2) The Administrator will not deduct for excess emissions any CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances allocated for 2012 or any year thereafter.
    (c)(1) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located 
in the State of Texas and Indian country within the borders of the State 
and for which requirements are set forth under the TR SO<INF>2</INF> 
Group 2 Trading Program in subpart DDDDD of part 97 of this chapter must 
comply with such requirements. The obligation to comply with such 
requirements with regard to sources and units in the State will be 
eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a 
revision to Texas' State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting in part 
the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the TR Federal Implementation 
Plan under Sec. 52.39, except to the extent the Administrator's 
approval is partial or conditional. The obligation to comply with such 
requirements with regard to sources and units located in Indian country 
within the borders of the State will not be eliminated by the 
promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Texas' 
SIP.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, if, at the time of the approval of Texas' SIP revision 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator has 
already started recording any allocations of TR SO<INF>2</INF> Group 2 
allowances under subpart DDDDD of part 97 of this chapter to units in 
the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart 
DDDDD of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to 
complete the allocation and recordation of TR SO<INF>2</INF> Group 2 
allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall 
continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the

PM-10 SIP revisions. It is anticipated that EPA, TACB, the City of El 
Paso, and SEDUE will continue a cooperative effort to study the PM-10 
air quality in the El Paso/Juarez air basin. Based on the availability 
of enhanced emissions and monitoring data, as well as more sophisticated 
modeling techniques (e.g., Urban Airshed Model), future studies will 
attempt to better define the relative contributions of El Paso and 
Juarez to the PM-10 problem in the basin. At that time, a contingency 
plan can more appropriately be developed in a cooperative effort with 
Mexico.''

    (103) Revisions to the Texas SIP addressing VOC RACT Negative 
Declarations. A revision to the Texas SIP was submitted on January 10, 
1996, which included negative declarations for various categories. 
Section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires 
nonattainment areas to adopt, at a minimum, the reasonably available 
control technology (RACT) to reduce emissions from existing sources. 
Pursuant to section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone 
nonattainment areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such 
sources and developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or 
Alternate Control Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those 
sources. When no major volatile organic compound (VOC) sources for a 
source category exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a 
negative declaration for that category. Texas submitted negative 
declarations for the areas and source categories listed in this 
paragraph (c)(103). For the Beaumont/Port Arthur region, negative 
declarations were submitted for the following eight categories: clean-up 
solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, 
plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, 
autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For Dallas/Fort Worth, 
negative declarations were submitted for six categories: industrial 
wastewater, clean-up solvents, shipbuilding and repair, autobody 
refinishing, plastic part coatings-business machines, and offset 
lithography. For the Houston/Galveston area, negative declarations were 
submitted for seven categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, 
wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part 
coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For El 
Paso, negative declarations were submitted for nine categories: 
industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, 
shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business 
machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset 
lithography. This submittal satisfies section 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air 
Act Amendments of 1990 for these particular CTG/ACT source categories 
for the Texas ozone nonattainment areas stated in this paragraph 
(c)(103).
    (i) Incorporation by reference. The letter dated January 10, 1996, 
from the Governor of Texas to the Regional Administrator, submitting the 
Post-1996 Rate of Progress Plan as a revision to the SIP, which included 
VOC RACT negative declarations.

Sec. 52.2301  Federal compliance date for automobile and light-duty 
truck coating. Texas Air Control Board Regulation V (31 TAC chapter 

115), control of air pollution from volatile organic compound, rule 
          115.191(1)(8)(A).

    (a) The requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act are not met 
regarding the final compliance date, as found in TACB rule 
115.191(a)(8)(A), for the requirements of TACB Rule 115.191(a)(8)(A).
    (b) TACB adopted revisions to rule 115.191(a)(8)(A) on October 14, 
1988, and submitted them to EPA on December 13, 1988. Prior to the 
submittal, automobile and light-duty truck coating operations were to 
have complied with final control limits of Sec. A115.191(a)(8)(B) of 
the federally approved State Implementation Plan (SIP), by December 31, 
1986. In the December 13, 1988, submittal, the final control limits had 
been moved to Sec. 115.191(a)(8)(A) and had been given a new extended 
compliance date of December 31, 1987. EPA does not recognize the later 
compliance data and retains the original compliance date for the final 
emission limits of December 31, 1986. The owner or operator of an 
automobile and light-duty truck coating operation shall comply with the 
requirements of TACB rule 115.191(a)(8)(A) no later than December 31, 
1986.

Sec. 52.2305  What are the requirements of the Federal Implementation 
Plan (FIP) to issue permits under the Prevention of Significant 

Deterioration requirements to sources that emit greenhouse gases?

    (a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air 
Act are not met to the extent the plan, as approved, for Texas does not 
apply with respect to emissions of the pollutant GHGs from certain 
stationary sources. Therefore, the provisions of Sec. 52.21 except 
paragraph (a)(1) are hereby made a part of the plan for Texas for:
    (1) Beginning on May 1, 2011, the pollutant GHGs from stationary 
sources described in Sec. 52.21(b)(49)(iv), and
    (2) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the pollutant GHGs from

Sec. 52.2306  Particulate Matter (PM10) Group II SIP commitments.

    On July 18, 1988, the Governor of Texas submitted a revision to the 
State Implementation Plan (SIP) that contained commitments for 
implementing all of the required activities including monitoring, 
reporting, emission inventory, and other tasks that may be necessary to 
satisfy the requirements of the PM<INF>10</INF> Group II SIPs. The Texas 
Air Control Board adopted these revisions on May 13, 1988. The State of 
Texas has committed to comply with the PM<INF>10</INF> Group II SIP 
requirements, as articulated in the Federal Register notice of July 1, 
1987 (52 FR 24670), for the defined areas of Dallas, Harris, Lubbock, 
and Nueces counties as provided in the Texas PM<INF>10</INF> Group II 
SIPs. In addition to the SIP, a letter from the Governor of Texas, dated 
July 18, 1988, stated that:

    * * * In the July 1, 1987 issue of the Federal Register, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency announced the requirement that each 
state submit a committal SIP for PM<INF>10</INF> Group II areas instead 
of full control strategies. States were also required to submit 
demonstrations of attainment and maintenance of the PM<INF>10</INF> 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The TACB is committed to 
carrying out the activities contained in the enclosed proposed SIP to 
satisfy those requirements * * *.

Sec. 52.2307  Small business assistance program.

    The Governor of Texas submitted on November 13, 1992 a plan revision 
to develop and implement a Small Business Stationary Source Technical 
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program to meet the requirements 
of section 507 of the Clean Air Act by November 15, 1994. The plan 
commits to provide technical and compliance assistance to small 
businesses, hire an Ombudsman to serve as an independent advocate for 
small businesses, and establish a Compliance Advisory Panel to advise 
the program and report to the EPA on the program's effectiveness.

Sec. 52.2308  Area-wide nitrogen oxides (NOX) exemptions.

    (a) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) 
submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting that the 
Dallas ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as 
amended in 1990. The Dallas nonattainment area consists of Dallas, 
Tarrant, Denton, and Collin counties. The exemption request was based on 
a photochemical grid modeling which shows that the Dallas nonattainment 
area would attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 
ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the 
additional NO<INF>X</INF> controls required under section 182(f). On 
November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally approved this exemption 
request, conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the 
Dallas attainment demonstration SIP.
    (b) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition 
requesting that the El Paso ozone nonattainment area be exempted from 
the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean 
Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The El Paso nonattainment area 
consists of El Paso county, and shares a common airshed with Juarez, 
Mexico. The exemption request was based on a photochemical grid modeling 
which shows that the El Paso nonattainment area would attain the NAAQS 
for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the 
additional NO<INF>X</INF> controls required under section 182(f), but 
for emissions emanating from Mexico. On November 21, 1994, the EPA 
conditionally approved this exemption request, conditioned upon the EPA 
approving the modeling portion of the El Paso attainment demonstration 
SIP.
    (c) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted to 
the EPA on May 4, 1994, a petition requesting that the Victoria County 
incomplete data ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the 
requirement to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> provisions of the Federal 
transportation conformity rule. The exemption request was based on 
monitoring data which demonstrated that

[[Page 338]]

the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in 
this area for the 35 months prior to the petition, with the 
understanding that approval of the State's request would be contingent 
upon the collection of one additional month of data. The required 
additional month of verified data was submitted later and, together with 
the data submitted with the State's petition, demonstrated attainment of 
the NAAQS for 36 consecutive months. The EPA approved this exemption 
request on March 2, 1995.
    (d) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on August 17, 1994, with 
supplemental information submitted on August 31, 1994, and September 9, 
1994, a petition requesting that the Houston and Beaumont ozone 
nonattainment areas be temporarily exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
control requirements of section 182(f) of the CAA. The Houston 
nonattainment area consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, 
Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller counties. The Beaumont 
nonattainment area consists of Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties. 
The exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which 
shows that reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not contribute to 
attaining the ozone NAAQS. On April 12, 1995, the EPA approved the 
State's request for a temporary exemption. Approval of the temporary 
exemption waives the federal requirements for NO<INF>X</INF> Reasonably 
Available Control Technology (RACT), New Source Review (NSR), 
conformity, and vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) for the period 
of the temporary exemption. The temporary exemption automatically 
expires on December 31, 1996, without further notice from the EPA. Based 
on the rationale provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this 
action, upon the expiration of the temporary exemption, the requirements 
pertaining to NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, NSR, conformity, and I/M will again 
become applicable, except that the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT implementation 
date applicable to the Houston and Beaumont nonattainment areas under 
section 182(f) shall be as expeditious as practicable but no later than 
May 31, 1997, unless the State has received a permanent NO<INF>X</INF> 
exemption from the EPA prior to that time.
    (e) The TNRCC submitted to EPA on March 6, 1996, a petition 
requesting that the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone 
nonattainment areas be granted an extension to a previously-granted 
temporary exemption from the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of 
sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act. The temporary exemption 
was granted on April 19, 1995. The current petition is based on the need 
for more time to complete UAM to confirm the need for, and the extent 
of, NO<INF>X</INF> controls required. On May 23, 1997, EPA approved the 
State's request for an extension to the temporary exemption. The 
temporary extension automatically expires on December 31, 1997, without 
further notice from EPA. Upon expiration of the extension, the 
requirements pertaining to NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, NSR, I/M, general and 
transportation conformity will become applicable, except that the 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT compliance date shall be implemented as 
expeditiously as practicable, but no later than May 31, 1999, unless the 
State has received a contingent NO<INF>X</INF> exemption from the EPA 
prior to that time.
    (f) The extension of the temporary exemption from NO<INF>X</INF> 
control requirements of sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act 
for the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment 
areas granted on May 23, 1997, expired December 31, 1997. Upon 
expiration of the extension, the requirements pertaining to 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, NSR, I/M, general and transportation conformity 
will become applicable and the State is expected to implement the 
requirements as expeditiously as possible.
    (g) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted a 
letter to EPA requesting rescission of the previously-granted 
conditional exemption from the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of 
section 182(f) of the Act for the Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment 
area. The letter was sent on November 13, 1998. The conditional 
exemption was granted on November 21, 1994, conditioned upon EPA 
approving the modeling portion of the DFW attainment demonstration SIP. 
The conditional exemption was also approved on a contingent basis. The 
modeling-based exemption would last only as long as

[[Page 339]]

the area's modeling continued to demonstrate attainment without the 
additional NO<INF>X</INF> reductions required by section 182(f). The 
State's request is based on new photochemical modeling which shows the 
need for NO<INF>X</INF> controls to help the area attain the ozone 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Furthermore, EPA would not and 
could not approve the earlier attainment demonstration SIP modeling upon 
which the condition was based.
    (1) On June 21, 1999, the conditional NO<INF>X</INF> exemption for 
the DFW area granted on November 21, 1994 is rescinded. Upon rescission, 
the Federal requirements pertaining to NO<INF>X</INF> Reasonably 
Available Control Technology (RACT), New Source Review, vehicle 
Inspection/Maintenance, general and transportation conformity now apply.
    (2) The NO<INF>X</INF> RACT final compliance date must be 
implemented as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than March 31, 
2001.

must be taken if contingency measures are implemented in the Salt Lake, 
Davis or Utah County nonattainment areas. These plans were requested to 
be withdrawn by the Governor in a November 9, 1998, letter to the 
Regional Administrator. EPA returned the portions of these plans with a 
letter to the Governor on January 29, 1999. A nonsubstantive change was 
made in this section as a result of the revision which moves section 
4.13.3 D to section 4.13.3.E; this change was also approved by EPA. On 
February 6, 1996 the Governor of Utah submitted revisions to the Utah 
State Implementation Plan to revise Utah's open burning regulations,

1, 2001.
    (ii) Additional Material.
    (A) Letter dated December 7, 2001 from Governor Michael O. Leavitt 
submitting Utah County's inspection and maintenance program state 
implementation plan revision.
    (B) Evaluation of the Utah County Inspection/Maintenance Program,

    (51) On May 13, 2002, the Governor of Utah submitted a revision to 
Utah's SIP involving a new rule R307-310 ``Salt Lake County: Trading of 
Emission Budgets for Transportation Conformity.'' R307-310 allows 
trading from the motor vehicle emissions budget for primary Particulate 
Matter of 10 microns or less in diameter (PM<INF>10</INF>) in the Salt 
Lake County PM<INF>10</INF> SIP to the motor vehicle emissions budget 
for Nitrogen Oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) in the Salt Lake County 
PM<INF>10</INF> SIP. This trading mechanism allows Salt Lake County to 
increase their NO<INF>X</INF> budget in the Salt Lake County 
PM<INF>10</INF> SIP by decreasing their PM<INF>10</INF> budget by an 
equivalent amount. These adjusted budgets in the Salt Lake County 
PM<INF>10</INF> SIP would then be used for transportation conformity 
purposes.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Rule R307-310 ``Salt Lake County: Trading of Emission Budgets 
for Transportation Conformity'', as adopted on May 13, 2002, by the Utah 
Air Quality Board, and State effective on May 13, 2002.
    (52) [Reserved]
    (53) On September 27, 2001, the Governor of Utah submitted a 
revision to Utah's SIP involving R307-301 ``Utah and Weber Counties: 
Oxygenated Gasoline Program.'' Specifically, the State revised R307-301-
3 ``Average Oxygen Content Standard'' to only require the implementation 
of a 2.7% oxygen by weight program and not a 3.1% program that the State 
had mandated in a 1998 revision.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Rule R307-301-3 ``Average Oxygen Content Standard'', as adopted 
on September 5, 2001, by the Utah Air Quality Board, and State effective 
on September 10, 2001. This rule supersedes and replaces R307-8-3.1.B.
    (54) On July 3, 2002, the Governor of Utah submitted a SIP revision 
revising the SIP for the Utah County nonattainment area for particulates 
of 10 microns in size or smaller (PM<INF>10</INF>). The Governor's 
submittal, among other things, revises the existing attainment 
demonstration in the approved PM<INF>10</INF> SIP based on a short-term 
emissions inventory, establishes 24-hour emission limits for the major 
stationary sources in the Utah County PM<INF>10</INF> nonattainment area 
and establishes motor vehicle emission budgets based on EPA's most 
recent mobile source emissions model, Mobile6.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.

requirements for performance audits of acid rain monitors and to correct 
several typographical and grammatical errors.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Utah Administrative Code sections: R307-170-7(1); 307-170-4; 
R307-170-5(1)(b); R307-170-5(7); R307-170-7(6); R307-170-7(6)(a) and 
(b); and in R307-170-9 sections (5)(a) and (d), (6)(b), (7)(a)(i), 
(7)(b), and (9)(a); effective January 5, 2006.
    (65) On March 22, 2007 the Governor of Utah submitted the addition 
to the Utah Administrative Code (UAC) of Rule R307-110-36. This rule 
incorporates by reference Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, of the 
Utah State Implementation Plan (SIP). The Interstate Transport 
declaration satisfies the requirements of Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) of the 
Clean Air Act (CAA). On September 17, 2007, the Governor of Utah also 
submitted an amendment to the UAC Rule R307-130-4, ``Options,'' that 
removes from the text a typographical error. It removes the word ``not'' 
which had been accidentally placed in this rule.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Addition to the UAC of rule R307-110-36 that incorporates by 
reference Section XXIII, ``Interstate Transport,'' of the Utah SIP. Rule 
R307-110-36 was adopted by the UAQB on February 7, 2007, effective 
February 9, 2007, and it was submitted by the Governor to EPA on March 
22, 2007.
    (B) Revision to UAC Rule R307-130-4, ``Options.'' This revision 
removes from the text the word ``not.'' The amended text was adopted by 
the UAQB on June 21, 2007, effective July 13, 2007, and it was submitted 
by the Utah Governor to EPA on September 17, 2007.
    (ii) Additional material.
    (A) Replacement page for UAC Rule R307-110-36 attached to the March 
22, 2007 submittal letter by the Utah Governor to EPA. The new page 
correctly refers to Section XXIII of the Utah SIP instead of the 
incorrect reference to Section XXII included in the corresponding page 
submitted with the Administrative Documentation for Rule R307-110-36.
    (66) Revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan, ``Section XII, 
Transportation Conformity Consultation,'' as submitted by the Governor 
on June 26, 2007; and revisions to UAC R307-110-20, ``Section XII,

the Utah County PM<INF>10</INF> nonattainment area.
    (b) [Reserved]

[66 FR 32760, June 18, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2323  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Utah's plan as meeting the requirements of section 110 of the 
Clean Air Act as amended in 1977. Furthermore, the Administrator finds 
that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the 
Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below.
    (b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) 
provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of 
greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that 
application only to the extent that GHGs are ``subject to regulation'', 
as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action 
on that application to the extent that GHGs are not ``subject to 
regulation.''
    (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to 
regulation if:
    (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a 
regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will 
have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; or
    (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source 
for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an 
emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions 
increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; and,
    (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be 
subject to regulation:
    (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential 
to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e; or
    (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the 
potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, when such stationary 
source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation 
that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e 
or more.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)--
    (i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 
40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: 
Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
    (ii) The term tpy CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent emissions 
(CO<INF>2</INF>e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall 
be computed as follows:
    (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the 
six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated 
global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR 
part 98--Global Warming Potentials.
    (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this 
section for each gas to compute a tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (iii) the term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant 
emissions increase (as calculated using

[[Page 359]]

the procedures in 40 CFR 52.21(a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net 
emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and 
(b)(23)(i)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall 
be based on tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, and shall be calculated assuming the 
pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and ``significant'' is 
defined as 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e instead of applying the value in 
40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(ii).

Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area has attained the 
ozone standard based on air quality monitoring data from 1992, 1993, and 
1994, and that the reasonable further progress and attainment 
demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements 
of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for 
so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone 
standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Salt 
Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area, these determinations 
shall no longer apply.

    (c) The State of Utah has clarified the generalized language 
contained in the Utah Air Conservation Regulations on the use of the 
``Guidelines on Air Quality Models.'' In a letter to Douglas M. Skie, 
EPA, dated May 26, 1989, F. Burnell Cordner, Director of the Bureau of 
Air Quality, stated:

    * * * The language in section 3.7 of the Utah Air Conservation 
Regulations on the use of ``Guidelines on Air Quality Models'' means 
that all PSD permit reviews will comply with the use of the ``Guideline 
on Air Quality Models (Revised)'', EPA 450/2-78-027R, and any future 
supplements approved by EPA.

Sec. 52.2348  National Highway Systems Designation Act Motor Vehicle 
Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Programs.

    (a) On March 15, 1996 the Governor of Utah submitted a revised I/M 
program for Utah County which included a credit claim, a basis in fact 
for the credit claimed, a description of the County's program, draft 
County ordinances, and authorizing legislation for the program. Approval 
is granted on an interim basis for a period of 18 months, under the 
authority of section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act 
of 1995. If Utah County fails to start its program by November 15, 1997 
at the latest, this approval will convert to a disapproval after EPA 
sends a letter to the State. At the end of the eighteen month period, 
the approval will lapse. At that time, EPA must take final rulemaking 
action upon the State's SIP, under the authority of section 110 of the 
Clean Air Act. Final action on the State/County's plan will be taken 
following EPA's review of the State/County's credit evaluation and final 
regulations (State and County) as submitted to EPA.
    (b) On May 20, 1999, the State of Utah submitted an evaluation of 
the Utah County inspection and maintenance program. On December 7, 2001, 
the Governor of Utah submitted Rule R307-110-34 and Section X, Vehicle 
Inspection and Maintenance Program, Part D, Utah County. These 
submittals satisfy the interim approval requirements specified under 
section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act of 1995 (62 
FR 31351, 63 FR 414). Under the authority of section 110 of the Clean 
Air Act, EPA is removing the interim status of Utah County's improved 
inspection and maintenance program and granting Utah County full final 
approval of their improved inspection and maintenance program.

Sec. 52.2350  Emission inventories.

    (a) The Governor of the State of Utah submitted the 1990 base year 
emission inventory of ozone precursors, which are volatile organic 
compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide, for the Salt Lake and 
Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area on January 13, 1995, as a 
revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). This inventory 
addresses emissions from point, area, non-road, on-road mobile, and 
biogenic sources. This Governor's submittal was followed by the 
submittal of corrections to the inventory, on April 20, 1995, from 
Russell Roberts, Director, Division of Air Quality, Utah Department of 
Environmental Quality. The ozone maintenance plan for Salt Lake and 
Davis Counties that the Governor submitted on February 19, 1997, 
incorporates by reference the corrected 1990 base year ozone emission 
inventory as background material. The 1990 ozone base year emission 
inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the Salt Lake and Davis Counties 
area.
    (b) On November 12, 1997, the Governor of Utah submitted the 1993 
Carbon Monoxide Periodic Emission Inventories for Ogden City and Utah 
County as revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan. These 
inventories address carbon monoxide emissions from stationary point, 
area, non-road, and on-road mobile sources.
    (c) On June 14, 1999, the Governor of Utah submitted the 1996 Carbon 
Monoxide Periodic Emission Inventory for Utah County as a revision to 
the Utah State Implementation Plan. The inventory addresses carbon

Sec. 52.2351  Area-wide nitrogen oxides (NOX) exemption.

    On May 2, 1997, Ursula Trueman, Director, Division of Air Quality, 
Utah Department of Environmental Quality, submitted, on behalf of the 
State of Utah and pursuant to section 182(f)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act 
as amended in 1990, a section 182(f)(2) NO<INF>X</INF> Reasonably 
Available Control Technology (RACT) exemption request for major 
stationary sources of NO<INF>X</INF> in the Salt Lake and Davis Counties 
ozone nonattainment area other than the Pacificorp Gadsby and Kennecott 
Utah

Copper Utah Power Plants. The exemption request was based on ambient air 
quality monitoring data which demonstrated that the ozone National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) had been attained in the Salt Lake 
and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area for the years 1990 through 
1996. EPA approved this NO<INF>X</INF> RACT exemption request on July 2, 
1997.

Sec. 52.2352  Change to approved plan.

    (a) Utah Air Conservation Regulation R307-18-1, New Source 
Performance Standards, is removed from the approved plan. On June 10, 
2002, we issued a letter delegating responsibility for all sources 
located, or to be located, in the State of Utah subject to the NSPS in 
40 CFR part 60. See the table in 40 CFR 60.4 for the status of NSPS 
delegated to the state of Utah.
    (b) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-8, Asbestos Work 
Practices, Contractor Certification, AHERA Accreditation and AHERA 
Implementation, is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation 
Plan (SIP). This rule language pertains to the regulation of asbestos 
and is generally not related to attainment of the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards (NAAQS) and therefore it is not appropriate to be in 
Utah's SIP.
    (c) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-4.12, National 
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), is removed 
from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). Utah has 
delegation of authority for NESHAPs in 40 CFR part 61 (49 FR 36368), 
pursuant to 110(k)(6) of the Act.
    (d) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-6, Eligibility of 
Pollution Control Expenditures for Sales Tax Exemption, is removed from 
Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule language 
pertains to State Sales Tax Exemptions for Pollution Control 
Expenditures and is not generally related to attainment of the National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and is therefore not appropriate 
to be in Utah's SIP.
    (e) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-102-3, Administrative 
Procedures and Hearings, and R307-414-3, Request for Review, are removed 
from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). These provisions 
are not required by the CAA and are, therefore, not required to be in 
Utah's SIP. These provisions were last approved in 40 CFR 
52.2320(c)(59)(i)(A).
    (f) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-4.06, Continuous 
Emission Monitoring Systems Program (CEMSP), is removed from Utah's 
approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule has been superseded 
and replaced by rule R307-170, Continuous Emission Monitoring Program.

Sec. 52.2353  Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.

    Determination. EPA has determined that the Provo carbon monoxide 
``moderate'' nonattainment area attained the carbon monoxide national 
ambient air quality standard by December 31, 1995. This determination is 
based on air quality monitoring data from 1994 and 1995.

Sec. 52.2354  Interstate transport.

    CAA Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) requirements for the 1997 8-hour ozone 
and PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards. Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, of 
the Utah SIP submitted by the Utah Governor on March 22, 2007, satisfies 
the requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 8-
hour ozone and PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS promulgated by EPA in July 1997. 
Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, was adopted by the UAQB on February 
9, 2007. The March 22, 2007 Governor's letter included as an attachment 
a set of replacement pages for the Interstate Transport text. The new 
pages reflect correctly that the Interstate Transport declaration is 
under Section XXIII of the Utah SIP and not under Section XXII as 
incorrectly indicated in the pages submitted with the Administrative 
Documentation for the adoption of this SIP section.

Sec. 52.2355  Section 110(a)(2) infrastructure requirements.

    On December 3, 2007 Jon L. Huntsman, Jr., Governor, State of Utah, 
submitted a certification letter which provides the State of Utah's SIP 
provisions which meet the requirements of CAA Section 110(a)(1) and (2) 
relevant to the 1997 Ozone NAAQS. On December 21, 2009 M. Cheryl Heying, 
Director, Utah Division of Air Quality, Department of Environmental 
Quality for the State of Utah, submitted supporting documentation which 
provides the State of Utah's SIP provisions which meet the requirements 
of CAA Section 110(a)(1) and (2) relevant to the 1997 Ozone NAAQS.

Sec. 52.2372  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Vermont's plan as identified in Sec. 52.2370 for the 
attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 
of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plans 
satisfy all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued 
satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the 
SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 
1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January, 1978 and 
January, 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of 
additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the 
previous January.

Sec. 52.2373  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met. 
Vermont does not have the authority to make emissions data available to 
the public since 10 V.S.A. section 363 would require the data to be held 
confidential if a source certified that it related to production or 
sales figures, unique processes, or would tend to affect adversely the 
competitive position of the owner.

Sec. 52.2374  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan

does not provide for public availability of emission data.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

Sec. 52.2382  Rules and regulations.

    (a) Non-Part D--No Action. EPA is neither approving or disapproving 
the following elements of the revisions:
    (1) Permit fees.
    (2) Intergovernmental consultation.
    (3) Stack height requirements.
    (4) Interstate pollution notification requirements.
    (5) Conflict of interest requirements.
    (b) Regulation for visibility monitoring and new source review. The 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 52.26 and 52.27 are hereby incorporated and 
made a part of the applicable plan for the State of Vermont.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2383  Visibility protection.

    (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not 
met because the plan does not include approvable procedures meeting the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 for protection of visibility in 
mandatory Class I Federal areas.

[[Page 373]]

    (b) Regulations for visibility monitoring and new source review. The 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 52.26 and 52.27 are hereby incorporated and 
made part of the applicable plan for the State of Vermont.

[51 FR 5505, Feb. 13, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2384  Stack height review.

    The State of Vermont has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no 
existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits 
greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited 
dispersion techniques as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as 
revised on July 8, 1985. This declaration was submitted to EPA on March 
21, 1986. The State has further declared in a letter from Harold T. 
Garabedian, dated March 21, 1986, that, ``[T]he State concludes that our 
present rule 5-502(4)(d) is adequate to insure that new emission sources 
will not be able to use credits from modeling ambient impacts at greater 
than `good engineering practice' stack height or from using `other 
dispersion techniques.' '' Thus, Vermont has satisfactorily demonstrated 
that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

[37 FR 15090, July 27, 1972, as amended at 39 FR 16347, May 8, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2422  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2423  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Virginia's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards. The State included a provision dealing with open 
burning in its submittal of August 10, 1973.This provision was included 
for information purposes only and was not to be considered a part of the 
plan to implement national standards. Accordingly, this additional 
provision is not considered a part of the applicable plan.
    (b)-(c) [Reserved]
    (d) The portion of the January 11, 1979 SIP submittal pertaining to 
Smyth County is not approved, pending a possible redesignation of the 
area to attainment status.
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 51.22 are not met with respect to 
section 4.55(b) of the Virginia regulations, because the regulation is 
not adequately enforceable. Therefore, section 4.55(b) is disapproved.
    (f) Section 9 VAC 5-40-20.A.3. of the Virginia Regulations for the 
Control and Abatement of Air Pollution is not considered part of the 
applicable plan because it contradicts a previously approved section of 
the SIP.
    (g) Section 4.31(d)(3) of Part IV of the Virginia Regulations for 
the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution is not considered part of the 
applicable plan because the substitute criteria, listed in section 
4.31(d)(3), contain inherent variations in quality control which do not 
present an accurate representation of collection efficiency.
    (h) In an April 19, 1991 request submitted by the Virginia 
Department of Air Pollution Control, the source-specific emission 
limitation for James River Paper which EPA had approved on August 18, 
1983 is deleted. James River Paper Co. (now known as Custom Papers

on November 12, 1992, by the Department of Environmental Quality. These 
requests are disapproved because review of the 1993 ambient air quality 
data monitored during the 1993 ozone season indicated that a violation 
of the ozone NAAQS occurred at the Charles City monitor in the Richmond 
nonattainment area . Because of the registered violation during the 1993 
ozone season, the underlying basis of the Commonwealth's November 12, 
1992, maintenance plan's demonstration is no longer valid.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2430  Determinations of attainment.

    (a) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year 
period 2007 to 2009, EPA determined that the Metropolitan Washington, 
District of Columbia-Maryland-Virginia (DC-MD-VA) fine particle 
(PM<INF>2.5</INF>) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the 
applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the 
requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the 
area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained 
the standard. EPA also determined that the Metropolitan Washington, DC-
MD-VA PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area is not subject to the 
consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).
    (b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year 
period 2007 to 2009, Washington, DC-MD-VA moderate nonattainment area 
has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment 
date of June 15, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant 
to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air 
quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the 
standard. EPA also determined that the Washington, DC-MD-VA moderate 
nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its 
applicable attainment date pursuant to section 181(b)(2)(A).

administer the requirements of this section to a State air pollution 
control agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator.
    (d) Site-wide emissions caps. The permit shall establish site-wide 
emissions caps as provided in this paragraph.
    (1) Initial site-wide emissions caps. The initial site-wide 
emissions caps shall be based on the site's actual emissions during a 
time period, within five years of the date of permit issuance, which 
represents normal site operation. The permitting authority may allow the 
use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more 
representative of normal source operation. Actual site-wide emissions 
shall be calculated using the actual operating hours, production rates, 
and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the 
selected time period.
    (i) Total criteria pollutant emissions cap. The permit shall 
establish a total criteria pollutant emissions cap (total emissions 
cap). The criteria pollutants included in the total emissions cap are 
the following: carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone (using volatile 
organic compounds as surrogate), particulate matter with an aerodynamic 
diameter less than 10 microns, and sulfur dioxide.

shall require that the site's actual emissions of criteria pollutants 
shall not exceed the total emissions cap established pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) The permit shall require that the site's actual emissions of 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and PM<INF>10</INF> shall not exceed the 
respective individual pollutant cap established pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (3) Compliance with the total emissions cap and individual pollutant 
caps shall be determined by comparing the respective cap to the 12-month 
rolling total for that cap. Compliance with the total emissions cap and 
individual pollutant caps shall be determined within one month of the 
end of each month

[[Page 425]]

based on the prior 12 months. The permit shall set forth the emission 
calculation techniques which the site shall use to calculate site-wide 
actual criteria pollutant emissions.
    (4) Installation of controls for significant modifications and 
significant new installations. (i) This paragraph applies to significant 
modifications and significant new installations. Significant 
modifications for the purposes of this section are defined as changes to 
an existing process unit that result in an increase of the potential 
emissions of the process unit, after consideration of existing controls, 
of more than the significance levels listed in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of 
this section. Significant new installations for the purposes of this 
section are defined as new process units with potential emissions before 
controls that exceed the significance levels listed in paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this section, potential 
emissions means process unit point source emissions that would be 
generated by the process unit operating at its maximum capacity.
    (ii) The significance levels for determining significant 
modifications and significant new installations are: 100 tons per year 
of carbon monoxide; 40 tons per year of nitrogen oxides; 40 tons per 
year of sulfur dioxide; 40 tons per year of volatile organic compounds; 
and 15 tons per year of PM<INF>10</INF>.
    (iii) For any significant modification or significant new 
installation, the permit shall require that the site install, at the 
process unit, emission controls, pollution prevention or other 
technology that represents good environmental engineering practice in 
the pharmaceutical or batch processing industry, based on the emission 
characteristics (such as flow, variability, pollutant properties) of the 
process unit.
    (f) Operation of control equipment. The permit shall require that 
the site shall continue to operate the emissions control equipment that 
was previously subject to permit requirements at the time of issuance of 
a permit pursuant to this section. This equipment shall be operated in a 
manner which minimizes emissions, considering the technical and physical 
operational aspects of the equipment and associated processes. This 
operation shall include an operation and maintenance program based on 
manufacturers' specifications and good engineering practice.
    (g) Powerhouse conversion. The permit shall require that the site 
convert the steam-generating powerhouse from burning coal as the primary 
fuel to burning natural gas as the primary fuel and either No. 2 fuel 
oil or propane as backup fuel.
    (1) The new boilers shall be equipped with low nitrogen oxides 
technology.
    (2) The site shall complete the powerhouse conversion (completion of 
the powerhouse conversion) no later than 30 months after the effective 
date of the permit.
    (h) Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. (1) The permit shall 
set forth monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements 
sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the site-wide emissions caps. 
The monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements shall be 
structured in a tiered system, such that the requirements become more 
stringent as the site's emissions approach the total emissions cap.
    (2) At a minimum, the permit shall require that the site submit to 
the permitting authority semi-annual reports of the site-wide criteria 
pollutant emissions (expressed as a 12-month rolling total) for each 
month covered by the report. These reports shall include a calculation 
of the total emissions cap, as well as, the emissions of sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and 
PM<INF>10</INF>.
    (3) Any reports required by the permit to be submitted on an annual 
or semi-annual basis shall contain a certification by the site's 
responsible official that to his belief, based on reasonable inquiry, 
the information submitted in the report is true, accurate, and complete.
    (4) Any records required by the permit shall be retained on site for 
at least five years.
    (i) Air quality analysis. The permittee shall demonstrate, prior to 
permit issuance and on a periodic basis which shall be specified in the 
permit, that emissions from construction or operation of the site will 
not cause or contribute to air pollution in excess of any:

[[Page 426]]

    (1) Maximum allowable increase or maximum allowable concentration 
for any pollutant, pursuant to section 165 of the Act;
    (2) National ambient air quality standard or;
    (3) Other applicable emission standard or standard of performance 
under the Act.
    (j) Termination. (1) The permit may be terminated as provided in 
this paragraph for reasons which shall include the following, as well as 
any other termination provisions specified in the permit:
    (i) If the Administrator or the permitting authority determines that 
continuation of the permit is an imminent and substantial endangerment 
to public health or welfare, or the environment;
    (ii) If the permittee knowingly falsifies emissions data;
    (iii) If the permittee fails to implement the powerhouse conversion 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section;
    (iv) If the permittee receives four consent orders or two judgments 
adverse to the site arising from non-compliance with this permit in a 
five year period that are deemed material by the Administrator or the 
permitting authority; or
    (v) If the total emissions cap is exceeded.
    (2) In the event of termination, the Administrator or the permitting 
authority shall provide the permittee with written notice of its intent 
to terminate the permit. Within 30 calendar days of the site's receipt 
of this notice, the site may take corrective action to remedy the cause 
of the termination. If this remedy, which may include a corrective 
action plan and schedule, is deemed acceptable by the Administrator or 
the permitting authority (whichever agency provided written notice of 
its intent to terminate the permit), the action to terminate the permit 
shall be withdrawn. Otherwise, the permit shall be terminated in 
accordance with procedures specified in the permit.
    (3) Termination of the permit does not waive the site's obligation 
to complete any corrective actions relating to non-compliance under the 
permit.
    (k) Inspection and entry. (1) Upon presentation of credentials and 
other documents as may be required by law, the site shall allow 
authorized representatives of the Administrator and the permitting

Sec. 52.2472  Extensions.

    The Administrator, by authority delegated under section 188(d) of 
the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, extends for one year (until 
December 31, 1995) the attainment date for the Spokane, Washington, PM-
10 nonattainment area and the Wallula, Washington, PM-10 nonattainment 
area.

[60 FR 47280, Sept. 12, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2473  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Washington's plan for the attainment and maintenance of 
National Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. The 
regulations included in the SIP (See Table 52.2479) are applicable 
statewide unless otherwise noted in the regulation itself. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds that the plan as identified in Sec. 52.2470 
satisfies requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air act as 
amended in 1977, except as noted in the following sections. Continued 
satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the 
SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 
1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and 
January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of 
additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the 
previous January. New source review permits pursuant to section 173 of 
CAA will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V 
of the emission offset interpretive rule published on January 16, 1979 
(44 FR 3274) are met.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2474  General requirements.

    (a) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by

[[Page 469]]

the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in 
compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

[37 FR 10902, May 31, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2522  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth below in this subpart, the 
Administrator approves West Virginia's plan for the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standards.

[[Page 507]]

    (a) The Administrator approves the deletion of the provisions found 
in section 3.03(b) of regulation X except as it applies to the 
Rivesville plant, Monongahela Power Co.
    (b) The Administrator hereby extends the interim limitation of 5.12 
lbs. SO<INF>2</INF> per million BTU for the Harrison power plant until a 
permanent emission limitation is approved.
    (c) The Administrator approves the amended Sections 3.01(2) and 
3.03(1) of West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission Regulation X 
submitted January 25, 1978 and amended September 13, 1978, as a plan for 
attainment of the primary SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS. The Administrator does 
not approve the State's control strategy for attainment and maintenance 
of the secondary SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS submitted on those dates, so far 
as it applies to the Mitchell and Harrison power stations.
    (d)-(f) [Reserved]
    (g) The Administrator approves West Virginia's November 22, 1995 SIP 
submittal for the Follansbee, West Virginia PM-10 nonattainment area as 
fulfilling the section 189(a)(1)(B) requirement for a demonstration that 
the plan is sufficient to attain the PM-10 NAAQS.
    (h) EPA disapproves the portion of 45 CSR 13 subsection 1 
referencing major stationary sources which have not been issued a permit 
pursuant to 45 CSR 30 and section 11.2, submitted by the West Virginia 
Department of Environmental Protection on August 26, 1994, as revisions 
to the West Virginia SIP. These provisions do not meet the requirements 
of 40 CFR 51.160 for scope. EPA also disapproves 45 CSR 13 section 9, 
submitted by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection on 
August 26, 1994, as a revision to the West Virginia SIP. These 
provisions do not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.161 for public 
participation.
    (i)(1) EPA is fully approving WVDEP's August 31, 2011 submittal, 
except for the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable 
emissions of particulate matter in the definition of ``regulated NSR 
pollutant'' found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. Except for this narrow issue, 
EPA is approving all other portions of the submittal, including but not 
limited to, the remainder of section 2.66. In approving West Virginia 
State Rule 45CSR14 with regard to all other CAA and Federal regulatory 
SIP requirements for PSD applicable as of the August 31, 2011 SIP 
revision submission date, EPA is acknowledging that it is consistent 
with the ``Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V 
Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule'' (Tailoring Rule), which was promulgated 
on June 3, 2010 (75 FR 31514). EPA is not finalizing its proposed 
approval of WVDEP's August 31, 2011 submittal with respect to the narrow 
issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate 
matter in the definition of ``regulated NSR pollutant'' found at 45CSR14 
section 2.66. In light of a comment received on its July 31, 2012 
proposed rule (77 FR 45302), EPA is reviewing West Virginia State Rule 
45CSR14 to determine the extent to which its definition of ``regulated 
NSR pollutant'' satisfies the corresponding Federal definition, and will 
address this issue in a separate action.
    (2) EPA is also approving those portions of West Virginia's SIP 
submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007, April 3, 2008, 
October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 2012 which address 
the PSD-related requirements set forth in CAA section 
110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) for the 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, 1997 8-hour 
ozone NAAQS, 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, 2008 lead NAAQS, and 2008 
ozone NAAQS, as well as CAA Section 110(a)(2)(C) and (J) for the 2008 
lead NAAQS and 2008 ozone NAAQS, except for the narrow issue of the 
requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in 
the definition of ``regulated NSR pollutant'' found at 45CSR14 section 
2.66. EPA is not finalizing its July 31, 2012 proposed approval (77 FR 
45302) of WVDEP's SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 
2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 
2012 submitted to meet the PSD-related infrastructure SIP obligations 
set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) with respect 
to the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions 
of particulate matter in the definition of ``regulated

[[Page 508]]

NSR pollutant'' found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. EPA will address this 
issue in a separate action.
    (j)(1) EPA is disapproving a narrow portion of West Virginia's 
August 31, 2011 submittal because it does not satisfy the requirement 
that emissions of PM<INF>2.5</INF> and PM<INF>10</INF> shall include 
gaseous emissions which condense to form particulate matter at ambient 
temperatures. This disapproval extends only to the lack of condensable 
emissions within the definition of ``regulated NSR pollutant,'' found at 
45CSR14 section 2.66, and does not alter EPA's October 17, 2012 (77 FR 
63736) approval of the remaining portions of West Virginia's August 2011 
SIP submittal.
    (2) EPA is disapproving specific portions of West Virginia's 
infrastructure SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 
2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 
2012 which address certain obligations set forth at CAA sections 
110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) relating to the West Virginia PSD 
permit program. Because West Virginia's definition of ``regulated NSR 
pollutant'' in 45CSR14 does not address condensables for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> and PM<INF>10</INF> emissions, EPA is determining that 
West Virginia's infrastructure SIP submissions do not meet certain 
statutory and regulatory obligations relating to a PSD permit program 
set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) for the 
narrow issue of condensables as set forth in the following table.

    (55) On January 28, 1985, Wisconsin submitted its Rothschild 
(Marathon County) SO<INF>2</INF> plan, which contains emission limits 
for sources in the City of Rothschild and the Town of Weston, 
specifically for the Weyerhaeuser Paper Company and the Reed-Lignin 
Company, respectively. USEPA is approving NR 418.08 because this 
revision meets the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act, 42 
U.S.C. 7501-7508. The Wisconsin SIP, however, contains additional 
existing requirements for SO<INF>2</INF>. Today's action on NR 418.08 
has been integrated within Wisconsin's existing SIP regulations, and 
does not eliminate a source's obligation to comply with all existing 
SO<INF>2</INF> SIP requirements. Specifically, today's action in no way 
affects the terms and conditions of a Federal Consent Decree entered 
into by USEPA and the Weyerhaeuser Company located in Rothschild, 
Wisconsin No. 89-C-0973-C (W.D. Wis., filed November 1, 1989). This 
Consent Decree resolves USEPA's enforcement action against Weyerhaeuser 
Company for violations of SIP rule NR 154.12(1) (now recodified as 
418.08). In that Decree, Weyerhaeuser committed to comply with NR 
154.12(1) by installing a desulfurization scrubber. August 15, 1989, the 
WDNR issued a construction permit to Weyerhaeuser which limit the 
combined emissions of Weyerhaeuser's acid plant and desulfurization 
scrubber to 28 pounds of SO<INF>2</INF> per hour. The conditions and 
terms of this construction permit and of the Consent Decree remain 
federally enforceable. On May 9, 1987, 18 months past the effective date 
of USEPA's designation of Marathon County as a primary SO<INF>2</INF> 
non-attainment area (October 9, 1985, (50 FR 41139)), a construction 
moratorium was imposed in Marathon County under section 110(a)(2)(I) of 
the Clean Air Act because the county did not have a USEPA approved plan 
which assured the attainment and maintenance of the SO<INF>2</INF> 
NAAQS. However, USEPA final approval of Rothschild's SO<INF>2</INF> SIP 
will lift the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban in Marathon County.

effective September 1, 2005.
    (114) On April 11, 2006, Wisconsin submitted revised regulations 
that match 40 CFR 51.100(s)(1), as amended at 69 FR 69298. As a result, 
the compounds, 1,1,1,2,2,3,3-heptafluoro-3-methoxy-propane, 3-ethoxy-
1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-dodecafluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)hexane, 
1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, and methyl formate, are added to the 
list of ``nonphotochemically reactive hydrocarbons'' or ``negligibly 
photochemically reactive compounds'' in NR 400.02(162)(a)45. to 48. 
Companies producing or using the four compounds will no longer need to 
follow the VOC rules for these compounds. Section NR 400.02(162)(b) was 
added for the compound t-butyl acetate. It is not considered a VOC for 
emission limits and content requirements. T-butyl acetate will still be 
considered a VOC for the recordkeeping, emissions reporting, and 
inventory requirements. Wisconsin also added and modified sections of NR 
424.05, its VOC control requirements for yeast manufacturing facilities. 
Wisconsin's requirements are the same as the federal requirements in the 
national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for nutritional 
yeast manufacturing.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.

Control Definitions, Section 2: Definitions, Subsection 162: ``Volatile 
organic compound,'' and Sec. NR 424: Control of Organic Compound 
Emissions from Process Lines, Section 5: Yeast Manufacturing, Subsection 
2: Emission Limitations, and Subsection 5: Test Methods and Procedures. 
The regulations were effective on January 1, 2006.
    (115) On April 25, 2006, Wisconsin submitted source specific SIP 
revision to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the control 
of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from synthetic resin manufacturing 
operations. The revision consists of language contained in an 
Administrative Decision (AM-05-200), dated February 24, 2005, approving 
the use of a high efficiency thermal oxidizer as an equivalent control 
system or approach to meet VOC RACT emission control requirements for 
Cook Composites and Polymers Company located in Saukville, Wisconsin, in 
Ozaukee County.

created and published in the (Wisconsin) Register, July, 2007, No. 619, 
effective August 1, 2007.
    (117) On May 1, 2007, Wisconsin submitted for EPA approval into the 
Wisconsin SIP a revision to renumber and amend NR 406.03, to amend NR 
410.03(intro.) and to create NR 406.03(2) and NR 410.03(l)(bm) Wis. 
Admin. Code, effective June 1, 2007. This revision allows WDNR to issue 
a waiver to a source allowing it to commence construction prior to a 
construction permit being issued. This provision is only allowed for 
minor sources which meet specific criteria. These revisions also revise 
Wisconsin's fee provisions to allow a fee to be charged for the waiver. 
EPA has determined that this revision is approvable under the Act.

revisions revise Wisconsin's rules to incorporate Federal regulations 
into the Wisconsin Administrative Code, to clarify construction permit 
requirements under general permits, revise portable source relocation 
requirements, and to amend rule language to streamline the minor 
revision permit process to allow construction permits to be issued 
concurrently with operation permits. EPA has determined that this 
revision is approvable under the Act.

person who cannot obtain emission data from the

[[Page 558]]

Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as 
specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source 
subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may 
request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make 
public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written 
request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator 
of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature 
and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as 
may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine 
whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission 
limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable 
plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

Sec. 52.2584  Control strategy; Particulate matter.

    (a) Part D--Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Regulation NR 
154.11(7)(b) of Wisconsin Administrative Code (RACT Requirements for 
Coking Operations), which is part of the control strategy to attain and 
maintain the standards for particulate matter, because it does not 
contain an enforceable RACT-level numerical visible emission limitation 
for charging operations.
    (b) Approval--On April 30, 1988 and March 30, 1990, the State of 
Wisconsin submitted committal SIPs for particulate matter with an 
aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers 
(PM<INF>10</INF>) for the Group II areas within the Cities of DePere, 
Madison, Milwaukee, Superior, and Waukesha. This committal SIP meets all 
of the requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the

Sec. 52.2585  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Disapproval--On November 6, 1986, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted as a proposed revision to the State's ozone 
State Implementation Plan a site-specific reasonably available control 
technology determination for a miscellaneous metal parts and products 
dip coating line. This line is located at the Gehl facility in 
Washington County, Wisconsin. In a May 31, 1988 (53 FR 19806), notice of 
proposed rulemaking, United States Environmental Protection Agency 
proposed to disapprove this site-specific revision to the Wisconsin 
State Implementation Plan for ozone.
    (b) Disapproval--On August 22, 1986, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a proposed revision to its ozone State 
Implementation Plan consisting of a site-specific reasonably available 
control technology determination for two miscellaneous metal parts and 
products spray coatings lines. These operations are located at the 
General Electric Company, Medical Systems facility in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, an area which has been designated as nonattainment for ozone, 
pursuant to section 107 of the Clean Air Act and 40 Code of Federal 
Regulations, part 81, Sec. 81.350.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Approval--On November 15, 1992, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan. The submittal pertained to the development of a process for 
assessing conformity of any federally-funded transportation and other 
federally funded projects in the nonattainment area.
    (e) Approval--On January 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan for the 1990 base year inventory. The inventory was submitted by 
the State of Wisconsin to satisfy Federal requirements under section 
182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act), as a 
revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for all

[[Page 563]]

areas in Wisconsin designated nonattainment, classified marginal to 
extreme. These areas include counties of Walworth, Door, Kewaunee, 
Manitowoc, Sheboygan, and the six county Milwaukee area (counties of 
Washington, Ozaukee, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Racine, and Kenosha).
    (f) Approval--The Administrator approves the incorporation of the 
photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by 
Wisconsin on November 15, 1993, into the Wisconsin State Implementation 
Plan. This submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f) which requires the State 
to provide for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical 
assessment monitoring stations (PAMS).
    (g) Approval--On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the 
severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and 
demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary 
to offset growth in emissions.
    (h) Approval--On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the 
severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and 
demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary 
to meet the 15 percent Rate-of-Progress milestone.
    (i) Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new 
source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general 
conformity exemptions for the moderate and above ozone nonattainment 
areas within Wisconsin as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, 
Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval also 
covers the exemption of transportation and general conformity 
requirements of section 176(c) for the Door and Walworth marginal ozone 
nonattainment areas. Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the 
results of the final ozone attainment demonstration expected to be 
submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be modified if the final 
attainment demonstration demonstrates that NO<INF>X</INF> emission 
controls are needed in any of the nonattainment areas to attain the 
ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling domain.
    (j) Approval--On June 14, 1995, the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. 
The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation and enforcement 
of the Federal transportation conformity requirements at the State or 
local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T--Conformity to 
State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, 
and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the 
Federal Transit Act.
    (k) Approval--On December 15, 1995, and May 15, 1996, the Wisconsin 
Department of Natural Resources submitted requests to redesignate 
Walworth County and Sheboygan and Kewaunee Counties, respectively, from 
nonattainment to attainment for ozone. The State also submitted 
maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act, 42 
U.S.C. 7505a. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plans include 
attainment emission inventories for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, 
demonstrations of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission 
inventories to the year 2007 for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, plans to verify 
continued attainment, and contingency plans. If a violation of the ozone 
NAAQS, determined to be caused by local sources is monitored, Wisconsin 
will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained 
in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is 
recorded, the State will notify EPA and review the data for quality 
assurance. A plan to analyze the violation, including an analysis of 
meteorological conditions, will be submitted within 60 days to EPA-
Region 5 for approval. Within 14 months of the violation, Wisconsin will 
complete and public notice the analysis and submit it to EPA-Region 5 
for review. If the analysis shows that local sources caused the 
violation, Wisconsin will

[[Page 564]]

implement the contingency measures within 24 months after the violation. 
The contingency measures to be implemented in Walworth County are Stage 
II vapor recovery and non-Control Technology Guideline (non-CTG) 
Reasonably available control technology (RACT) limits. Contingency 
measures to be implemented in either Kewaunee or Sheboygan County are 
lower major source applicability thresholds for industrial sources and 
new gasoline standards which will lower VOC emissions. The redesignation 
request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in 
section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act, respectively.
    (l) Wisconsin's November 15, 1994 request for a temporary delay of 
the ozone attainment date for Manitowoc County from 1996 to 2007 and 
suspension of the automatic reclassification of Manitowoc County to 
serious nonattainment for ozone is approved, based on Wisconsin's 
demonstration through photochemical grid modeling that transport from 
upwind areas makes it ``practicably impossible'' for the County to 
attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard by its original 
attainment date.
    (m) Approval--On July 10, 1996, the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. 
The submittal pertained to a request to waive the Oxide of Nitrogen 
requirements for transportation conformity in the Milwaukee and 
Manitowoc ozone nonattainment areas.
    (n) Approval--On September 8, 2000, Wisconsin submitted a revision 
to the ozone maintenance plan for the Walworth County area. The revision 
consists of allocating a portion of the Walworth County area's Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOC) safety margin to the transportation conformity 
Motor Vehicle Emission Budget (MVEB). The MVEB for transportation 
conformity purposes for the Walworth County area are now: 5.39 tons per 
day of VOC emissions and 7.20 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen 
emissions for the year 2007. This approval only changes the VOC 
transportation conformity MVEB for Walworth County.
    (o) Approval--On December 11, 1997, Wisconsin submitted a post-1996 
Rate Of Progress plan for the Milwaukee-Racine ozone nonattainment area 
as a requested revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan. 
Supplements to the December 11, 1997 plan were submitted on August 5, 
1999, January 31, 2000, March 3, 2000, and February 21, 2001 
establishing the post-1996 ROP plan for the Milwaukee-Racine ozone 
nonattainment area. This plan reduces ozone precursor emissions by 9 
percent from 1990 baseline emissions by November 15, 1999.
    (p) Approval--On December 27, 2000, Wisconsin submitted a one-hour 
ozone attainment demonstration plan as a revision to the Wisconsin State 
Implementation Plan (SIP). Supplements to the December 27, 2001 plan 
were submitted on May 28, 2001, June 6, 2001, and August 29, 2001. This 
plan includes a modeled demonstration of attainment, rules for the 
reduction of ozone precursor emissions, a plan to reduce ozone precursor 
emissions by three percent per year from 2000 to 2007, an analysis of 
reasonably achievable control measures, an analysis of transportation 
conformity budgets, a revision of the waiver for emission of oxides of 
nitrogen, and commitments to conduct a mid-course review of the area's 
attainment status and to use the new MOBILE6 emissions model.
    (q) Approval--On January 28, 2003, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a request to redesignate Manitowoc and Door 
Counties to attainment. Additional information was submitted on February 
5, 2003 and February 27, 2003. As part of the redesignation request, the 
State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the 
Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175 
maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit 
a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the 
Clean Air Act. The 2013 motor vehicle emission budgets for Door County 
are 0.74 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOC) per day and 1.17 tons 
of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) per day. The 2013 motor vehicle 
emission budgets for Manitowoc County are 1.89 tons of VOC per day and 
3.59 tons of NO<INF>X</INF> per day.

[[Page 565]]

    (r) Approval--On January 28, 2003, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a 1999 periodic emissions inventory for the 
Milwaukee-Racine area. Additional information was submitted on February 
5, 2003 and February 27, 2003. The inventory meets the requirement of 
section 182(2)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990.
    (s) Approval--On January 31, 2003, Wisconsin submitted a revision to 
the ozone attainment plan for the Milwaukee severe ozone area and 
maintenance plan for Sheboygan County. These plans revised 2007 motor 
vehicle emission inventories and 2007 Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets 
(MVEB) recalculated using the emissions factor model MOBILE6. The plan 
also included a new 2012 projected MVEB for the Sheboygan County. The 
following table outlines the MVEB for transportation conformity purposes 
for the Milwaukee severe ozone area and the Sheboygan ozone maintenance 
area:

    (u) Approval--On June 12, 2007, Wisconsin submitted a request to 
redesignate Kewaunee County to attainment of the 8-hour ozone standard. 
As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted an ozone 
maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Part 
of the section 175A maintenance plan includes a contingency plan. The 
ozone maintenance plan establishes 2012 motor vehicle emissions budgets 
for Kewaunee County of 0.43 tons per day of volatile organic compounds 
(VOC) and 0.80 tons per day of nitrogen oxIdes (NO<INF>X</INF>) and 2018 
motor vehicle emissions budgets for Kewaunee County of 0.32 tons per day 
of VOCs and 0.47 tons per day of NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (v) On July 28, 2008, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 
requested that EPA find that the Milwaukee-Racine, WI nonattainment 
area, attained the revoked 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard (NAAQS). After review of this submission, EPA approves this 
request.
    (w) Approval--On June 12, 2007, Wisconsin submitted 2005 VOC and 
NO<INF>X</INF> base year emissions inventories for the Manitowoc County 
and Door County areas. Wisconsin's 2005 inventories satisfy the base 
year emissions inventory requirements of section 172(c)(3) of the Clean 
Air Act for the Manitowoc County and Door County areas under the 1997 8-
hour ozone standard.
    (x) Approval--On September 11, 2009, Wisconsin submitted requests to 
redesignate the Manitowoc County and Door County areas to attainment of 
the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. As part of the redesignation requests, 
the State submitted maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the 
Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plans include 
contingency plans

[[Page 566]]

and an obligation to submit subsequent maintenance plan revisions in 8 
years as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plans also 
establish 2012 and 2020 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the 
areas. The 2012 MVEBs for the Manitowoc County and Door County areas are 
1.76 tons per day (tpd) for VOC and 3.76 tpd for NO<INF>X</INF>, and 
0.78 tpd for VOC and 1.55 tpd for NO<INF>X</INF>, respectively. The 2020 
MVEBs for the Manitowoc County and Door County areas are 1.25 tpd for 
VOC and 1.86 tpd for NO<INF>X</INF>, and 0.53 tpd for VOC and 0.74 tpd 
for NO<INF>X</INF>, respectively.
    (y) Determination of attainment. EPA has determined, as of March 1, 
2011 that the Milwaukee-Racine, WI and Sheboygan, WI areas have attained 
the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. These determinations suspend the 
requirements for these areas to submit attainment demonstrations and 
associated reasonably available control measures (RACM), reasonable 
further progress plans (RFP), contingency measures, and other State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions related to attainment of the 
standard for as long as the areas continue to attain the 1997 8-hour 
ozone standard. These determinations also stay the requirement for EPA 
to promulgate attainment demonstration and RFP Federal Implementation 
Plans (FIPs) for these areas.
    (z) Approval--Wisconsin submitted 2005 VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions inventories for the Milwaukee-Racine and Sheboygan areas on 
September 11, 2009, and supplemented the submittal on November 16, 2011. 
Wisconsin's 2005 inventories satisfy the emissions inventory 
requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the 
Milwaukee-Racine and Sheboygan areas under the 1997 8-hour ozone 
standard.
    (aa) Approval--On September 11, 2009, Wisconsin submitted a request 
to redesignate the Milwaukee-Racine area to attainment of the 1997 8-
hour ozone standard. The state supplemented this submittal on November 
16, 2011. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a 
maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. 
Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan 
and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 
years as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plan also 
establishes 2015 and 2022 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the 
area. The 2015 MVEBs for the Milwaukee-Racine area is 21.08 tpd for VOC 
and 51.22 tpd for NO<INF>X</INF>. The 2022 MVEBs for the Milwaukee-
Racine area is 15.98 tpd for VOC and 31.91 tpd for NO<INF>X</INF>.

Sec. 52.2589  Wisconsin construction permit permanency revision.

    This plan was originally submitted as Wis. Stat. 144.396 by 
Wisconsin on July 12, 1979 and approved into Wisconsin's SIP on June 25, 
1986 (51 FR 23056). Wis. Stat. 144.396 was renumbered Wis. Stat. 285.66 
in 1995 Wisconsin Act 227, effective January 1, 1997. On December 8, 
2005, Wisconsin submitted for EPA approval into the Wisconsin SIP a 
revision to Wis. Stats. 285.66(l), as amended in 2005 Wisconsin Act 25, 
effective July 26, 2005. This revision makes all conditions in 
Wisconsin's construction permits permanent. EPA has determined that this 
statutory revision is approvable under the Act.

Administrative Code concern the treatment of sources of greenhouse gas 
emissions as major sources for purposes of title V operating permits, 
EPA approves such provisions only to the extent they require permits for 
such sources where the source emits or has the potential to emit at 
least 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent emissions, as well as 100 
tpy on a mass basis, as of July 1, 2011.

Sec. 52.2591  Section 110(a)(2) infrastructure requirements.

    (a) Approval. In a December 12, 2007 submittal, supplemented on 
January 24, 2011 and March 28, 2011, Wisconsin certified that the State 
has satisfied the infrastructure SIP requirements of section 
110(a)(2)(A) through (C), (D)(ii), (E) through (H), and (J) through (M) 
for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. EPA is not finalizing its proposed 
approval of the submission from the State of Wisconsin with respect to 
two narrow issues that relate to section 110(a)(2)(C): The requirement 
for consideration of NOx as a precursor to ozone; and (ii) the 
definition of ``major modification'' related to fuel changes for certain 
sources. EPA will address these issues in a later action.
    (b) Approval. In a December 12, 2007 submittal, supplemented on 
January 24, 2011 and March 28, 2011, Wisconsin certified that the State 
has satisfied the infrastructure SIP requirements of section 
110(a)(2)(A) through (C), (D)(ii), (E) through (H), and (J) through (M) 
for the 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. EPA is not finalizing its proposed 
approval of the submission from the State of Wisconsin with respect to 
two narrow issues that relate to section 110(a)(2)(C): The requirement 
for consideration of NOx as a precursor to ozone; and the definition of 
``major modification'' related to fuel changes for certain sources. EPA 
will address these issues in a later action.
    (c) Disapproval. EPA is disapproving the portions of Wisconsin's 
infrastructure SIP for the 1997 ozone NAAQS

[[Page 570]]

with respect to two narrow issues that relate to section 110(a)(2)(C):
    (1) The requirement for consideration of NOx as a precursor to 
ozone; and
    (2) The definition of ``major modification'' related to fuel changes 
for certain sources.
    (d) Disapproval. EPA is disapproving the portions of Wisconsin's

    (1) The requirement for consideration of NOx as a precursor to

    (2) The definition of ``major modification'' related to fuel changes 
for certain sources.
    (e) Approval and Disapproval--In a January 24, 2011, submittal, 
supplemented on March 28, 2011, and June 29, 2012, Wisconsin certified 
that the State has satisfied the infrastructure SIP requirements of 
section 110(a)(2)(A) through (H), and (J) through (M) for the 2006 24-
hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. We are not finalizing action on (D)(i)(I), 
the visibility protection requirements of (D)(i)(II), and the state 
board requirements of (E)(ii). We will address these requirements in a 
separate action. We are disapproving narrow portions of Wisconsin's 
infrastructure SIP submission addressing the relevant prevention of 
significant deterioration requirements of the 2008 NSR Rule (identifying 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> precursors and the regulation of PM<INF>2.5</INF> and 
PM<INF>10</INF> condensables in permits) with respect to section

<R05>
Sec. 52.2724  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2725  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met, 
since section 2.4 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of 
Atmospheric Pollution could, in some circumstances, prohibit the 
disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, section 2.4 is 
disapproved.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2726  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, 
since Article 17 of Puerto Rico Act 9 could, in some circumstances, 
prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, 
Article 17 is disapproved.

Sec. Sec. 52.2727-52.2728  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2729  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air 
Act are

[[Page 590]]

not met, since the plan does not include approvable procedures for 
preventing the significant deterioration of air quality.
    (b) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air 
quality. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are 
hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable State plan for the 
State of Puerto Rico.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2730  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2731  Control strategy and regulations: Sulfur oxides.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since 
the Puerto Rico plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of 
the national standards for sulfur oxides in the areas of Aguirre, 
Barceloneta, Trujillo Alto-Dorado and Ensenada.
    (b) Article 6, as submitted to EPA on January 3, 1975, of the Puerto 
Rico Regulations for Control of Atmospheric Pollution, as it applies to 
those areas listed in paragraph (a) of this section is disapproved for 
the following facilities: Puerto RicoWater Resources Authority--Aguirre 
Complex, Abbott, Merck and Company, Bristol Meyers, Pfizer, Union 
Carbide, Upjohn, located in the Barceloneta air basin, and Central 
Guanica, located in the Aquada air basin. Accordingly, these sources, 
with the exception of the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority--Aguirre 
Complex, are required to conform to the sulfur in fuel limitations 
contained in Article 6 of the Puerto Rico implementation plan as 
submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972.
    (c) On and after the effective date of this paragraph, the maximum 
allowable sulfur in fuel limitation, by weight, for the Puerto Rico 
Water Resources Authority Aguirre complex shall be 2.5 percent.
    (d) The requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act are not met 
since Article 6 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of Atmospheric 
Pollution would permit the use of stack height increases in lieu of 
available methods for emission reduction. Therefore, Section H of 
Appendix A of Article 6 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of 
Atmospheric Pollution is disapproved to the extent that it would permit 
increases in stack height in lieu of available methods of emission 
reduction.

Sec. 52.2732  Small business technical and environmental compliance 
assistance program.

    On November 16, 1992, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board 
submitted a plan for the establishment and implementation of a Small 
Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance 
Assistance Program for incorporation in the Puerto Rico state 
implementation plan. This plan meets the requirements of section 507 of 
the Clean Air Act, and Puerto Rico must implement the plan as approved 
by EPA.

Sec. 52.2780  Control strategy for sulfur oxides.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since 
there has not been a satisfactory demonstration that the Virgin Islands 
plan provides for the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient 
air quality standards for sulfur oxides on the island of St. Croix.
    (b) The following parts of regulation 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26, 
``Sulfur Compounds Emission Control,'' as submitted to EPA on January 
21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976 are 
approved:
    (1) The entire regulation as it applies to the islands of St. Thomas 
and St. John.
    (2) The entire regulation as it applies to the Virgin Islands Water 
and Power

[[Page 595]]

Authority's Christiansted Power Plant on the island of St. Croix.
    (3) The entire regulation excluding subsection (a)(2) as it applies 
to the remaining sources on the island of St. Croix.

Subsection (a)(2) of the regulation is not approved as it applies to the 
remaining sources on St. Croix because of the inadequacy of the control 
strategy demonstration noted in paragraph (a) of this section. 
Accordingly, all sources on St. Croix with the exception of the Virgin 
Islands Water and Power Authority's Christiansted Power Plant are 
required to conform to the sulfur-in-fuel-oil limitations contained in 
12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 
1972.
    (c) Reference to ``Section (a)(2)'' in subsection (d) of 12 V.I.R. 
and R. 9:204-26, as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended 
and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976, refers to the following approved 
limitations: (1) For the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, subsection 
(a)(2) of section 204-26 as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as 
amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976; (2) for the island of 
St. Croix, subsection (a)(2) of section 204-26 as originally submitted 
to EPA on January 31, 1972 and approved by EPA on May 31, 1972.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2781  Visibility protection.

    (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not 
met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures for 
protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
    (b) Regulation for visibility monitoring. The provisions of Sec. 
52.26 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for 
the Virgin Islands.
    (c) Long-term strategy. The provisions of Sec. 52.29 are hereby 
incorporated and made part of the applicable plan for the Virgin 
Islands.
    (d) Regional Haze Plan for Virgin Islands National Park. The 
regional haze plan for the Virgin Islands consists of a Federal 
Implementation Plan entitled: ``FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR REGIONAL 
HAZE FOR THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS.'' The applicable requirements 
consist of:
    (1) Applicability. This section addresses Clean Air Act requirements 
and EPA's rules to prevent and remedy future and existing man-made 
impairment of visibility in the mandatory Class I area of the Virgin 
Islands National Park through a Regional Haze Program. This section 
applies to the owner and operator of HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 
petroleum refinery located on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
    (2) Definitions. Terms not defined below shall have the meaning 
given them in the Clean Air Act or EPA's regulations implementing the 
Clean Air Act. For purposes of this section:NO X means nitrogen oxides.
    Owner/operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, 
controls, or supervises a facility or source identified in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section.
    PM means particulate matter.
    Process unit means any collection of structures and/or equipment 
that processes, assembles, applies, blends, or otherwise uses material 
inputs to produce or store an intermediate or a completed product. A 
single stationary source may contain more than one process unit, and a 
process unit may contain more than one emissions unit. For a petroleum 
refinery, there are several categories of process units that could 
include: Those that separate and/or distill petroleum feedstocks; those 
that change molecular structures; petroleum treating processes; 
auxiliary facilities, such as steam generators and hydrogen production 
units; and those that load, unload, blend or store intermediate or 
completed products.
    SO 2 means sulfur dioxide.
    Startup means the setting in operation of an affected facility for 
any purpose.
    (3) Reasonable Progress Measures. On June 7, 2011, EPA and HOVENSA 
entered into a Consent Decree (CD) in the U.S. District Court for the 
Virgin Islands to resolve alleged Clean Air Act violations at its St. 
Croix, Virgin Islands facility. The CD requires HOVENSA, among other 
things, to achieve emission limits and install new

[[Page 596]]

pollution controls pursuant to a schedule for compliance. The measures 
required by the CD reduce emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> by 5,031 tons per 
year (tpy) and SO<INF>2</INF> by 3,460 tpy. The emission limitations, 
pollution controls, schedules for compliance, reporting, and 
recordkeeping provisions of the HOVENSA CD constitute an element of the 
long term strategy and address the reasonable progress provisions of 40 
CFR 51.308(d)(1). Should the existing federally enforceable HOVENSA CD 
be revised, EPA will reevaluate, and if necessary, revise the FIP after 
public notice and comment.
    (4) HOVENSA requirement for notification. HOVENSA must notify EPA 60 
days in advance of startup and resumption of operation of refinery 
process units at the HOVENSA, St. Croix, Virgin Islands facility. 
HOVENSA shall submit such notice to the Director of the Clean Air and 
Sustainability Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2, 
290 Broadway, 25th Floor, New York, New York, 10007-1866. HOVENSA's 
notification to EPA that it intends to startup refinery process units

 Sec. Appendix D to Part 52--Determination of Sulfur Dioxide Emissions 
             From Stationary Sources by Continuous Monitors

    1. Definitions.
    1.1 Concentration Measurement System. The total equipment required 
for the continuous determination of SO<INF>2</INF> gas concentration in 
a given source effluent.
    1.2 Span. The value of sulfur dioxide concentration at which the 
measurement system is set to produce the maximum data display output. 
For the purposes of this method, the span shall be set at the expected 
maximum sulfur dioxide concentration except as specified under section 
5.2, Field Test for Accuracy.
    1.3 Accuracy (Relative). The degree of correctness with which the 
measurement system yields the value of gas concentration of a sample 
relative to the value given by a defined reference method. This accuracy 
is expressed in terms of error which is the difference between the 
paired concentration measurements expressed as a percentage of the mean 
reference value.
    1.4 Calibration Error. The difference between the pollutant 
concentration indicated by the measurement system and the known 
concentration of the test gas mixture.
    1.5 Zero Drift. The change in measurement system output over a 
stated period of time of normal continuous operation when the pollutant 
concentration at the time for the measurement is zero.
    1.6 Calibration Drift. The change in measurement system output over 
a stated period of time of normal continuous operation when the 
pollutant concentration at the time of the measurement is the same known 
upscale value.
    1.7 Response Time. The time interval from a step change in pollutant 
concentration at the input to the measurement system to the time at 
which 95 percent of the corresponding final value is reached as 
displayed on the measurement system data presentation device.
    1.8 Operational Period. A minimum period of time over which a 
measurement system is expected to operate within certain performance 
specifications without unscheduled maintenance, repair or adjustment.
    1.9 Reference Method. The reference method for determination of 
SO<INF>2</INF> emissions shall be Method 8 as delineated in Part 60 of 
this chapter. The analytical and computational portions of Method 8 as 
they relate to determination of sulfuric acid mist and sulfur trioxide, 
as well as isokinetic sampling, may be omitted from the overall test 
procedure.
    2. Principle and Applicability.
    2.1 Principle. Gases are continuously sampled in the stack emissions 
and analyzed for sulfur dioxide by a continuously operating emission 
measurement system. Performance specifications for the continuous 
measurement systems are given. Test procedures are given to determine 
the capability of the measurement systems to conform to the performance 
specifications. Sampling may include either the extractive or 
nonextractive (in-situ) approach.
    2.2 Applicability. The performance specifications are given for 
continuous sulfur dioxide measurement systems applied to nonferrous 
smelters.
    3. Apparatus.
    3.1 Calibration Gas Mixture. Mixture of a known concentrations of 
sulfur dioxide in oxygen-free nitrogen. Nominal volumetric 
concentrations of 50 percent and 90 percent of span are recommended. The 
mixture of 90 percent of span is to be used to set and to check the span 
and is referred to as the span gas. The gas mixtures shall be analyzed 
by the Reference Method at least two weeks prior to use or demonstrated 
to be accurate and stable by an alternate method subject to approval of 
the Administrator.
    3.2 Zero Gas. A gas containing less than 1 ppm sulfur dioxide.
    3.3 Equipment for measurement of sulfur dioxide concentration using 
the Reference Method.

    5. Performance Specification Test Procedures.
    The following test procedures shall be used to determine compliance 
with the requirements of paragraph 4:
    5.1 Calibration test.
    5.1.1 Analyze each calibration gas mixture (50 percent, 90 percent) 
for sulfur dioxide by the Reference method and record the results on the 
example sheet shown in Figure D-1. This step may be omitted for 
nonextractive monitors where dynamic calibration gas mixtures are not 
used (see section 5.1.2).
    5.1.2 Set up and calibrate the complete measurement system according 
to the manufacturer's written instructions. This may be accomplished 
either in the laboratory or in the field. Make a series of five 
nonconsecutive readings with span gas mixtures alternately at each 
concentration (example, 50 percent, 90 percent, 50 percent, 90 percent, 
50 percent). For nonextractive measurement systems, this test may be 
performed using procedures specified by the manufacturer and two or more 
calibration gases whose concentrations are certified by the manufacturer 
and differ by a factor of two or more. Convert the measurement system 
output readings to ppm and record the results on the example sheet shown 
in Figure D-2.
    5.2 Field Test for Accuracy (Relative), Zero Drift and Calibration 
Drift. Install and operate the measurement system in accordance with the 
manufacturer's written instructions and drawings as follows:
    5.2.1 Conditioning Period. Offset the zero setting at least 10 
percent of span so that negative zero drift may be quantified. Operate 
the system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this 
period the system should measure the SO<INF>2</INF> content of the 
effluent in a normal operational manner.
    5.2.2 Operational Test Period. Operate the system for an additional 
168-hour period. The system shall be monitoring the source effluent at 
all times when not being zeroed, calibrated or backpurged.
    5.2.2.1 Field Test for Accuracy (Relative). The analyzer output for 
the following test shall be maintained between 20 percent and 90 percent 
of span. It is recommended that a calibrated gas mixture be used to 
verify the span setting utilized. During this 168-hour test period, make 
a minimum of nine (9) SO<INF>2</INF> concentration measurements using 
the Reference Method with a sampling period of one hour. If a 
measurement system operates across the stack or a portion of it, the 
Reference Method test shall make a four-point traverse over the 
measurement system operating path. Isokinetic sampling and analysis for 
SO<INF>3</INF> and H<INF>2</INF> SO<INF>4</INF> mist are not required. 
For measurement systems employing extractive sampling, place the 
measurement system and the Reference Method probe tips adjacent to each 
other in the duct. One test will consist of two simultaneous samples 
with not less than two analyses on each sample. Record the test data and 
measurement system concentrations on the example sheet shown in Figure 
D-3.
    5.2.2.2 Field Test for Zero Drift and Calibration Drift. Determine 
the values given by zero and span gas SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations at 
2-hour intervals until 15 sets of data are obtained. Alternatively, for 
nonextractive measurement systems, determine the values given by an 
electrically or mechanically produced zero condition, and by inserting a 
certified calibration gas concentration equivalent to not less than 20 
percent of span, into the measurement system. Record these readings on 
the example sheet shown in Figure D-4. These 2-hour periods need not be 
consecutive but may not overlap. If the analyzer span is set at the 
expected maximum concentration for the tests performed under section 
5.2.2, then the zero and span determinations to be made under this 
paragraph may be made concurrent with the tests under section 5.2.2.1. 
Zero and calibration corrections and adjustments are allowed only at 24-
hour intervals (except as required under section 5.2.2) or at such 
shorter intervals as the manufacturer's written instructions specify. 
Automatic corrections made by the measurement system without operator 
intervention or initiation are allowable at any time. During the entire 
168-hour test period, record the values given by zero and span gas 
SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations before and after adjustment at 24-hour 
intervals in the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
    5.3 Field Test for Response Time.

[[Page 604]]

    5.3.1 This test shall be accomplished using the entire measurement 
system as installed including sample transport lines if used. Flow 
rates, line diameters, pumping rates, pressures (do not allow the 
pressurized calibration gas to change the normal operating pressure in 
the sample line), etc., shall be at the nominal values for normal 
operation as specified in the manufacturer's written instructions. In 
the case of cyclic analyzers, the response time test shall include one 
cycle.
    5.3.2 Introduce a zero concentration of SO<INF>2</INF> into the 
measurement system sampling interface or as close to the sampling 
interface as possible. When the system output reading has stabilized, 
switch quickly to a known concentration of SO<INF>2</INF> at 70 to 90 
percent of span. Record the time from concentration switching to final 
stable response. After the system response has stabilized at the upper 
level, switch quickly to a zero concentration of SO<INF>2</INF>. Record 
the time from concentration switching to final stable response. 
Alternatively, for nonextractive monitors, a calibration gas 
concentration equivalent to 20 percent of span or more may be switched 
into and out of the sample path and response times recorded. Perform 
this test sequence three (3) times. For each test record the results on 
the example sheet shown in Figure D-6.
    6. Calculations, Data Analysis and Reporting.
    6.1 Procedure for determination of mean values and confidence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The values in this table are already corrected for n-1 degrees of 
freedom. Use n equal to the number of samples as data points.
    6.2 Data Analysis and Reporting.
    6.2.1 Accuracy (Relative). For each of the nine reference method 
testing periods, determine the average sulfur dioxide concentration 
reported by the continuous measurement system. These average 
concentrations shall be determined from the measurement system data 
recorded under section 5.2.2.1 by integrating the pollutant 
concentrations over each of the time intervals concurrent with each 
reference method test, then dividing by the cumulative time of each 
applicable reference method testing period. Before proceeding to the 
next step, determine the basis (wet or dry) of the measurement system 
data and reference method test data concentrations.
    If the bases are not consistent, apply a moisture correction to 
either the referenced method concentrations or the measurement system 
concentrations, as appropriate. Determine the correction factor by 
moisture tests concurrent with the reference method testing periods. 
Report the moisture test method and the correction procedure employed. 
For each of the nine test runs, subtract the Reference Method test 
concentrations from the continuous monitoring system average 
concentrations. Using these data, compute the mean difference and the 95 
percent confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. Accuracy is 
reported as the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the 
95 percent confidence interval expressed as a percentage of the mean 
reference method value. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-3.
    6.2.2 Calibration Error. Using the data from section 5.1 of this 
appendix, subtract the measured SO<INF>2</INF> value determined under 
section 5.1.1 (Figure D-1) from the value shown by the measurement 
system for each of the 5 readings at each concentration measured under 
section 5.1.2 (Figure D-2). Calculate the mean of these difference 
values and the 95 percent confidence intervals according to equations D-
1 and D-2. The calibration error is reported as the sum of absolute 
value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval as a 
percentage of each respective calibration gas concentration. Use example 
sheet shown in Figure D-2.
    6.2.3 Zero Drift (2-hour). Using the zero concentration values 
measured each two

[[Page 605]]

hours during the field test, calculate the differences between 
consecutive two-hour readings expressed in ppm. Calculate the mean 
difference and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. 
Report the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean value and the 
confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use 
example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
    6.2.4 Zero Drift (24-hour). Using the zero concentration values 
measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences 
between the zero point after zero adjustment and the zero value 24 hours 
later just prior to zero adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these 
points and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. Report 
the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval 
as a percentage of the emission standard. Use example sheet shown in 
Figure D-5.
    6.2.5 Calibration Drift (2-hour). Using the calibration values 
obtained at two-hour intervals during the field test, calculate the 
differences between consecutive two-hour readings expressed as ppm. 
These values should be corrected for the corresponding zero drift during 
that two-hour period. Calculate the mean and confidence interval of 
these corrected difference values using Equations D-1 and D-2. Do not 
use the differences between non-consecutive readings. Report the 
calibration drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence 
interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet 
shown in Figure D-4.
    6.2.6 Calibration Drift (24-hour). Using the calibration values 
measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences 
between the calibration concentration reading after zero and calibration 
adjustment and the calibration concentration reading 24 hours later 
after zero adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the 
mean value of these differences and the confidence interval using 
equations D-1 and D-2. Report the sum of the absolute mean and 
confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the 
example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
    6.2.7 Response Time. Using the charts from section 5.3 of this 
Appendix, calculate the time interval from concentration switching to 95 
percent to the final stable value for all upscale and downscale tests. 
Report the mean of the three upscale test times and the mean of the 
three downscale test times. For nonextractive instruments using a 
calibration gas cell to determine response time, the observed times 
shall be extrapolated to 90 percent of full scale response time. For 
example, if the observed time for a 20 percent of span gas cell is one 
minute, this would be equivalent to a 4\1/2\-minute response time when 
extrapolated to 90 percent of span. The two average times should not 
differ by more than 15 percent of the slower time. Report the slower 
time as the system response time. Use the example sheet shown in Figure 
D-6.
    6.2.8 Operational Period. During the 168-hour performance and 
operational test period, the measurement system shall not require any 
corrective maintenance, repair, replacement, or adjustment other than 
that clearly specified as required in the operation and maintenance 
manuals as routine and expected during a one-week period. If the 
measurement system operates within the specified performance parameters 
and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or 
adjustment other than specified above, during the 168-hour test period, 
the operational period will be successfully concluded. Failure of the 
measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a repetition of the 
168-hour test period. Portions of the test which were satisfactorily 
completed need not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance 
specifications shall call for a repetition of the one-week performance 
test period and that portion of the testing which is related to the 
failed specification. All maintenance and adjustments required shall be 
recorded. Output readings shall be recorded before and after all 
adjustments.
    6.2.9 Performance Specifications Testing Frequency. In the event 
that significant repair work is performed in the system, the company 
shall demonstrate to the Administrator that the system still meets the 
performance specifications listed in Table I of this appendix. The 
Administrator may require a performance test at any time he determines 
that such test is necessary to verify the performance of the measurement 
system.

      Sec. Appendix E to Part 52--Performance Specifications and, 
Specification Test Procedures for Monitoring Systems for Effluent Stream 
                        Gas Volumetric Flow Rate

    1. Principle and applicability.
    1.1 Principle. Effluent stream gas volumetric flow rates are sampled 
and analyzed by a continuous measurement system. To verify the 
measurement system performance, values obtained from the measurement 
system are compared against simultaneous values obtained using the 
reference method. These comparison tests will be performed to determine 
the relative accuracy, and drift of the measurement system over the 
range of operating conditions expected to occur during normal operation 
of the source. If the measurement system is such that the specified 
tests in section 5.1 for drift do not apply, those test procedures shall 
be disregarded.
    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to subparts which 
require continuous gas volumetric flow rate measurement. Specifications 
are given in terms of performance. Test procedures are given for 
determining compliance with performance specifications.
    2. Apparatus.
    2.1 Continuous measurement system for determining stack gas 
volumetric flow rate.
    2.2 Equipment for measurement of stack gas volumetric flow rate as 
specified in the reference method.
    3. Definitions.
    3.1 Measurement system. The total equipment required for the 
determination of the gas volumetric flow rate in a duct or stack. The 
system consists of three major subsystems:
    3.1.1 Sampling interface. That portion of the measurement system 
that performs one or more of the following operations: Delineation, 
acquisition, transportation, and conditioning of a signal from the stack 
gas and protection of the analyzer from any hostile aspects of the 
source environment.
    3.1.2 Analyzer. That portion of the measurement system which senses 
the stack gas flow rate or velocity pressure and generates a signal 
output that is a function of the flow rate or velocity of the gases.
    3.1.3 Data presentation. That portion of the measurement system that 
provides a display of the output signal in terms of volumetric flow rate 
units, or other units which are convertible to volumetric flow rate 
units.
    3.2 Span. The value of gas volumetric flow rate at which the 
measurement system is set to produce the maximum data display output. 
For the purposes of this method, the span shall be set at 1.5 times the 
maximum volumetric flow rate expected under varying operating conditions 
of the source.
    3.3 Zero drift. The change in measurement system output over a 
stated period of time of normal continuous operation when gas volumetric 
flow rate at the time of the measurements is zero.
    3.4 Calibration drift. The change in measurement system output over 
a stated time period of normal continuous operation when the gas 
volumetric flow rate at the time of the measurement is 67 percent of the 
span value.
    3.5 Operation period. A minimum period of time over which a 
measurement system is expected to operate within certain performance 
specifications without unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment.
    3.6 Orientation sensitivity. The angular tolerance to which the 
sensor can be misaligned from its correct orientation to measure the 
flow rate vector before a specified error occurs in the indicated flow 
rate compared to the reference flow rate.
    3.7 Reference method. Method 2 as delineated in 40 CFR Part 60.
    4. Measurement system performance specifications. A measurement 
system must meet the performance specifications in Table E-1 to be 
considered acceptable under this method.

                                Table E-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Parameter                          Specifications
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accuracy (relative)....................  <10 percent of mean reference
                                          value (paragraph 6.3.1).
Zero drift (24 hours)..................  <3 percent of span (paragraph
                                          6.3.2).
Calibration drift (24 hours)...........  <3 percent of span (paragraph
                                          6.3.3).
Operational period.....................  <168 hours minimum.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Test procedures.
    5.1 Field test for accuracy, zero drift, calibration drift, and 
operation period.
    5.1.1 System conditioning. Set up and operate the measurement system 
in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions and drawings. 
Offset the zero point of the chart recorder so that negative values up 
to 5 percent of the span value may be registered. Operate the system for 
an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this initial period, the 
system should measure the gas

[[Page 609]]

stream volumetric flow rate in a normal operational manner. After 
completion of this conditioning period, the formal 168-hour performance 
and operational test period shall begin.
    5.1.2 Field test for accuracy and operational period. During the 
168-hour test period, the system should be continuously measuring gas 
volumetric flow rate at all times. During this period make a series of 
14 volumetric flow rate determinations simultaneously using the 
reference method and the measurement system. The 14 determinations can 
be made at any time interval at least one hour apart during the 168-hour 
period except that at least one determination on five different days 
must be made with one determination on the last day of such period. The 
determinations shall be conducted over the range of volumetric flow 
rates expected to occur during normal operation of the source. The 
measurement system volumetric flow rate reading corresponding to the 
period of time during which each reference method run was made may be 
obtained by continuous integration of the measurement system signal over 
the test interval. Integration may be by use of mechanical integration 
of electrical units on the chart recorder or use of a planimeter on the 
strip chart recorder. The location and orientation of the reference 
method measurement device and the measurement system should be as close 
as practical without interference, but no closer than 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) 
to each other and shall be such that dilution air or other interferences 
cannot be interjected into the stack or duct between the pitot tube and 
the measurement system. Be careful not to locate the reference method 
pitot tube directly up or down stream of the measurement system sensor.
    5.1.3 Field test for calibration drift and zero drift. At 24-hour 
intervals, but more frequently if recommended by the manufacturer, 
subject the measurement system to the manufacturer's specified zero and 
calibration procedures, if appropriate. Record the measurement system 
output readings before and after adjustment. Automatic corrections made 
by the system without operator intervention are allowable at anytime.
    5.1.4 Field test for orientation sensitivity. If a velocity 
measurement system is either a single point measurement device or a 
pressure sensor or any other device such as pitot tube which uses the 
flow direction of the test gas, then the following test shall be 
followed and a performance specification of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 
degrees device orientation sensitivity for <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>4 
percent flow rate determination accuracy must be met in order for the 
measurement system to be considered acceptable under this method. This 
is in addition to the performance specifications given in paragraph 4 of 
this appendix. During a period of relatively steady state gas flow, 
perform the following orientation test using the measurement system. The 
system should be continuously measuring gas velocity at all times. 
Rotate the measurement 10[deg] on each side of the direction of flow in 
increments of 5[deg]. Perform this test three times each at:
    (1) Maximum operating velocity (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>15 percent);
    (2) 67 percent <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>7.5 percent of the maximum 
operating velocity; and
    (3) 33 percent <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>7.5 percent of the maximum 
operating velocity if (2) and (3) are normal operating practices.
    6. Calculations data analysis and reporting.
    6.1 Procedure for determination of stack gas volumetric flow rate. 
Calculate the reference stack gas velocity and corresponding stack gas 
volumetric flow rate with the calibrated type S pitot tube measurements 
by the reference method. Calculate the measurement system stack gas 
volumetric flow rate as specified by the manufacturer's written 
instructions. Record the volumetric flow rates for each in the 
appropriate tables.
    6.2 Procedure for determination of mean values and 95 percent 
confidence intervals.
    6.2.1 Mean value. The mean value of a data set is calculated 
according to Equation E-1.

equal to the number of samples as data points.
    6.3 Data analysis and reporting.
    6.3.1 Accuracy (relative). First, calculate the mean reference value 
(Equation E-1) of the 14 average volumetric flow rates calculated by the 
reference method. Second, from the 14 pairs of average volumetric flow 
rates calculated by the reference method and measurement system 
volumetric flow rate readings, calculate the mean value (Equation E-1) 
of the differences of the 14 paired readings. Calculate the 95 percent 
confidence interval (Equation E-2) using the differences of fourteen 
paired readings. To calculate the values in the second part of this 
section substitute di for xi and d for x in Equations E-1 and E-2 where 
di equals the difference of each paired reading and d equals the mean 
value of the fourteen paired differences. Third, report the sum of the 
absolute mean value of the differences of the fourteen paired readings 
and the 95 percent confidence interval of the differences of value 
calculated in the first part of the section. Divide this total by the 
mean reference value and report the result as a percentage. This 
percentage is the relative accuracy.
    6.3.2 Zero drift (24 hour). From the zero values measured each 24 
hours during the field test, calculate the differences between 
successive readings expressed in volumetric flow rate units. Calculate 
the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval of these 
differences using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute 
value of the mean difference and the confidence interval as a percentage 
of the measurement system span. This percentage is the zero drift.
    6.3.3 Calibration drift (24 hour). From the calibration values 
measured every 24 hours during the field test calculate the differences 
between: (1) The calibration reading after zero and calibration 
adjustment, and (2) the calibration reading 24 hours later after zero 
adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value 
of these differences and the confidence interval using Equations E-1 and 
E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and 
confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This 
percentage is the calibration drift.
    6.3.4 Operation period. Other than that clearly specified as 
required in the operation and maintenance manual, the measurement system 
shall not require any corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or 
adjustment during the 168-hour performance and operational test period. 
If the measurement system operates within the specified performance 
parameters and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, 
replacement or adjustment other than as specified above during the 168-
hour test period, the operational period will be successfully concluded. 
Failure of the measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a 
repetition of the 168-hour test period. Portions of the test, except for 
the 168-hour field test period, which were satisfactorily completed need 
not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance specifications shall 
call for a repetition of the one-week performance test period and that 
portion of the testing which is related to the failed specification. All 
maintenance and adjustments required shall be recorded. Output readings 
shall be recorded before and after all adjustments.
    6.3.5 Orientation sensitivity. In the event the conditions of 
paragraph 5.1.4 of this appendix are required, the following 
calculations shall be performed. Calculate the ratio of each measurement 
system reading divided by the reference pitot tube readings. Graph the 
ratio vs. angle of deflection on each side of center. Report the points
