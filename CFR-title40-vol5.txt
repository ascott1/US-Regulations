                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

tests and requirements set forth in subpart F of this part or may be 
special requirements and tests tailored by the Administrator to the 
specific nature, design, and operational characteristics of the 
candidate method. For example, a candidate method with an inlet design 
deviating substantially from the design of the reference method inlet 
would likely be subject to an inlet aspiration test similar to that set 
forth in Sec. 53.63. Similarly, a candidate method having an inertial 
fractionation system substantially different from that of the reference 
method would likely be subject to a static fractionation test and a 
loading test similar to those set forth in Sec. Sec. 53.64 and 53.65, 
respectively. A candidate method with more extensive or profound 
deviations from the design and function of the reference method may be 
subject to other tests, full wind-tunnel tests similar to those 
described in Sec. 53.62, or to special tests adapted or developed 
individually to accommodate the specific type of measurement or 
operation of the candidate method.

substance of the proposed revision, will indicate what period(s) of time 
the Administrator proposes to allow for replacement of existing methods 
under section 2.3 of appendix C to part 58 of this chapter, and will 
solicit public comments on the proposal with particular reference to the 
considerations

[[Page 20]]

set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (2)(i) If, after consideration of comments received, the 
Administrator determines that the appendix to part 50 in question should

 Automated Methods SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, O<INF>3</INF>, and NO<INF>2</INF>

Sec. 53.20  General provisions.

    (a) The test procedures given in this subpart shall be used to test 
the performance of candidate automated methods against the performance 
specifications given in table B-1. A test analyzer representative of the 
candidate automated method must exhibit performance better than, or 
equal to, the specified value for each such specification (except Range) 
to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the range of the candidate method must be 
the range specified in table B-1 to satisfy the requirements of this 
subpart.
    (b) For a candidate method having more than one selectable range, 
one range must be that specified in table B-1 and a test analyzer 
representative of the method must pass the tests required by this 
subpart while operated in that range. The tests may be repeated for a 
broader range (i.e., one extending to higher concentrations) than that 
specified in table B-1 provided that the range does not extend to 
concentrations more than two times the upper range limit specified in 
table B-1. If the application is for a reference method determination, 
the tests may be repeated for a narrower range (one extending to lower 
concentrations) than that specified in table B-1.

If the tests are conducted or passed only for the specified range, any 
reference or equivalent method determination with respect to the method 
will be limited to that range. If the tests are passed for both the 
specified range and a broader range (or ranges), any such determination 
will include the broader range(s) as well as the specified range, 
provided that the tests required by subpart C of this part (if 
applicable) are met for the broader range(s). If the tests are passed 
for both the specified range and a narrower range, a reference method 
determination for the method will include the narrower range as well as 
the specified range. Appropriate test data shall be submitted for each 
range sought to be included in a reference or equivalent

[[Page 22]]

method determination under this paragraph (b).
    (c) For each performance specification (except Range), the test 
procedure shall be initially repeated seven (7) times to yield 7 test 
results. Each result shall be compared with the corresponding 
specification in table B-1; a value higher than or outside that 
specified constitutes a failure. These 7 results for each parameter 
shall be interpreted as follows:
    (1) Zero (0) failures: Candidate method passes the performance 
parameter.
    (2) Three (3) or more failures: Candidate method fails the 
performance parameter.
    (3) One (1) or two (2) failures: Repeat the test procedures for the 
parameter eight (8) additional times yielding a total of fifteen (15) 
test results. The combined total of 15 test results shall then be 
interpreted as follows:
    (i) One (1) or two (2) failures: Candidate method passes the 
performance parameter.
    (ii) Three (3) or more failures: Candidate method fails the 
performance parameter.

Sec. 53.21  Test conditions.

    (a) Set-up and start-up of the test analyzer shall be in strict 
accordance with the operating instructions specified in the manual 
referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3). Allow adequate warm-up or stabilization 
time as indicated in the operating instructions before beginning the 
tests.

[[Page 23]]

If the candidate method does not include an integral strip chart 
recorder, connect the output signal of the test analyzer to a suitable 
strip chart recorder of the servo, null-balance type. This recorder 
shall have a chart width of at least 25 centimeters, chart speeds up to 
10 cm per hour, a response time of 1 second or less, a deadband of not 
more than 0.25 percent of full scale, and capability either of reading 
measurements at least 5 percent below zero or of offsetting the zero by 
at least 5 percent.

    Note: Other data acquisition components may be used along with the 
chart recorder during conduct of these tests. Use of the chart recorder 
is intended only to facilitate evaluation of data submitted.

    (b) Calibration of the test analyzer shall be as indicated in the 
manual referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3) and as follows: If the chart 
recorder does not have below zero capability, adjust either the controls 
of the test analyzer or the chart recorder to obtain a +5% offset zero 
reading on the recorder chart to facilitate observing negative response 
or drift. If the candidate method is not capable of negative response, 
the test analyzer (not recorder) shall be operated with an offset zero. 
Construct and submit a calibration curve showing a plot of recorder 
scale readings (ordinate) against pollutant concentrations (abscissa). A 
plot of output units (volts, millivolts, milliamps, etc.) against 
pollutant concentrations shall also be shown for methods not including 
an integral chart recorder. All such plots shall consist of at least 
seven (7) approximately equally spaced, identifiable points, including 0 
and 90<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of full scale.
    (c) Once the test analyzer has been set up and calibrated and the 
tests started, manual adjustment or normal periodic maintenance is 
permitted only every 3 days. Automatic adjustments which the test 
analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time. The submitted 
records shall show clearly when any manual adjustment or periodic 
maintenance was made and describe the operations performed.
    (d) If the test analyzer should malfunction during any of the 
performance tests, the tests for that parameter shall be repeated. A 
detailed explanation of the malfunction, remedial action taken, and 
whether recalibration was necessary (along with all pertinent records 
and charts) shall be submitted. If more than one malfunction occurs, all 
performance test procedures for all parameters shall be repeated.
    (e) Tests for all performance parameters shall be completed on the 
same test analyzer, except that use of multiple test analyzers to 
accelerate testing will be permitted when alternate ranges of a multi-
range candidate method are being tested.

Sec. 53.22  Generation of test atmospheres.

    (a) Table B-2 specifies preferred methods for generating test 
atmospheres and suggested methods of verifying the concentrations. Only 
one means of establishing the concentration of a test atmosphere is 
normally required. If the method of generation can produce reproducible 
concentrations, verification is optional. If the method of generation is 
not reproducible, then establishment of the concentration by some 
verification method is required. However, when a method of generation 
other than that given in table B-2 is used, the test concentration shall 
be verified.
    (b) The test atmosphere delivery system shall be designed and 
constructed so as not to significantly alter the test atmosphere 
composition or concentration during the period of the test. The delivery 
system shall be fabricated from borosilicate glass or FEP Teflon.
    (c) The output of the test atmosphere generation system shall be 
sufficiently stable to obtain stable response during the required tests. 
If a permeation device is used for generation of a test atmosphere, the 
device, as well as the air passing over it, shall be controlled to 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 [deg]C.
    (d) All diluent air shall be zero air free of contaminants likely to 
cause a detectable response on the test analyzer.

Sec. 53.23  Test procedures.

    (a) Range--(1) Technical definition. Nominal minimum and maximum 
concentrations which a method is capable of measuring.

    Note: The nominal range is specified at the lower and upper range 
limits in concentration units, for example, 0-0.5 p/m.

    (2) Test procedure. Submit a suitable calibration curve, as 
specified in Sec. 53.21(b), showing the test analyzer's response over 
at least 95 percent of the required range.

    Note: A single calibration curve will normally suffice.

    (b) Noise--(1) Technical definition. Spontaneous, short duration 
deviations in output, about the mean output, which are not caused by 
input concentration changes. Noise is determined as the standard 
deviation about the mean and is expressed in concentration units.
    (2) Test procedure. (i) Allow sufficient time for the test analyzer 
to warm up and stabilize. Determine at two concentrations, first using 
zero air and then a pollutant test gas concentration as indicated below. 
The noise specification in table B-1 shall apply to both of these tests.
    (ii) Connect an integrating-type digital meter (DM) suitable for the 
test analyzer's output and accurate to three significant digits, to 
measure the analyzer's output signal.

    Note: Use of a chart recorder in addition to the DM is optional.

    (iii) Measure zero air for 60 minutes. During this 60-minute 
interval, record twenty-five (25) readings at 2-minute intervals. (See 
Figure B-2 in appendix A.)
    (iv) Convert each DM reading to concentration units (p/m) by 
reference to the test analyzer's calibration curve as determined in 
Sec. 53.21(b). Label the converted DM readings r<INF>1</INF>, 
r<INF>2</INF>, r<INF>3</INF> . . . r<INF>i</INF> . . . 
r<INF>2</INF><INF>5</INF>.
    (v) Calculate the standard deviation, S, as follows:
    <GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>
    
where i indicates the i-th DM reading in ppm.

    (vi) Let S at 0 ppm be identified as S<INF>o</INF>; compare 
S<INF>o</INF> to the noise specification given in table B-1.
    (vii) Repeat steps (iii) through (vi) of this section using a 
pollutant test atmosphere concentration of 80<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent of the upper range limit (URL) instead of zero gas, and let S at 
80 percent of the URL be identified as S<INF>8</INF><INF>0</INF>. 
Compare S<INF>8</INF><INF>0</INF> to the noise specification given in 
table B-1.
    (viii) Both S<INF>0</INF> and S<INF>8</INF><INF>0</INF> must be less 
than or equal to the specification for noise to pass the test for the 
noise parameter.
    (c) Lower detectable limit--(1) Technical definition. The minimum 
pollutant concentration which produces a signal of twice the noise 
level.
    (2) Test procedure. (i) Allow sufficient time for the test analyzer 
to warm up and stabilize. Measure zero air and record the stable reading 
in ppm as BZ. (See Figure B-3 in appendix A.)
    (ii) Generate and measure a pollutant test atmosphere concentration 
equal to the value for the lower detectable limit specified in table B-
1.

    Note: If necessary, the test atmosphere concentration may be 
generated or verified at a higher concentration, then accurately

[[Page 26]]

diluted with zero air to the final required concentration.

    (iii) Record the test analyzer's stable indicated reading, in ppm, 
as B<INF>L</INF>.
    (iv) Determine the Lower Detectable Limit (LDL) as LDL = 
B<INF>L</INF>-B<INF>Z</INF>. Compare this LDL value with the noise 
level, S<INF>0</INF>, determined in Sec. 53.23(b), for 0 concentration 
test atmosphere. LDL must be equal to or higher than 2S<INF>0</INF> to 
pass this test.
    (d) Interference equivalent--(1) Technical definition. Positive or 
negative response caused by a substance other than the one being 
measured.
    (2) Test procedure. The test analyzer shall be tested for all 
substances likely to cause a detectable response. The test analyzer 
shall be challenged, in turn, with each interfering agent specified in 
table B-3. In the event that there are substances likely to cause a 
significant interference which have not been specified in table B-3, 
these substances shall be tested at a concentration substantially higher 
than that normally found in the ambient air. The interference may be 
either positive or negative, depending on whether the test analyzer's 
response is increased or decreased by the presence of the interferent. 
Interference equivalents shall be determined by mixing each interferent, 
one at a time, with the pollutant at the concentrations specified in 
table B-3, and comparing the test analyzer's response to the response 
caused by the pollutant alone. Known gas-phase reactions that might 
occur between an interferent and the pollutant are designated by 
footnote 3 in table B-3. In these cases, the interference equivalent 
shall be determined in the absence of the pollutant.
    (i) Allow sufficient time for warm-up and stabilization of the test 
analyzer.
    (ii) For a candidate method using a prefilter or scrubber based upon 
a chemical reaction to derive part of its specificity, and which 
requires periodic service or maintenance, the test analyzer shall be 
``conditioned'' prior to each interference test as follows:

[[Page 28]]

    (A) Service or perform the indicated maintenance on the scrubber or 
prefilter as directed in the manual referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3).
    (B) Before testing for each interferent, allow the test analyzer to 
sample through the scrubber a test atmosphere containing the interferent 
at a concentration equal to the value specified in table B-3. Sampling 
shall be at the normal flow rate and shall be continued for 6 continuous 
hours prior to testing.
    (iii) Generate three test atmosphere streams as follows:
    (A) Test atmosphere P: Pollutant concentration.
    (B) Test atmosphere I: Interference concentration.
    (C) Test atmosphere Z: Zero air.
    (iv) Adjust the individual flow rates and the pollutant or 
interferent generators for the three test atmospheres as follows:
    (A) The flow rates of test atmospheres I and Z shall be identical.
    (B) The concentration of pollutant in test atmosphere P shall be 
adjusted such that when P is mixed (diluted) with either test atmosphere 
I or Z, the resulting concentration of pollutant shall be as specified 
in table B-3.
    (C) The concentration of interferent in test atmosphere I shall be 
adjusted such that when I is mixed (diluted) with test atmosphere P, the 
resulting concentration of interferent shall be equal to the value 
specified in table B-3.
    (D) To minimize concentration errors due to flow rate differences 
between I and Z, it is recommended that, when possible, the flow rate of 
P be from 10 to 20 times larger than the flow rates of I and Z.
    (v) Mix test atmospheres P and Z by passing the total flow of both 
atmospheres through a mixing flask.
    (vi) Sample and measure the mixture of test atmospheres P and Z with 
the test analyzer. Allow for a stable reading, and record the reading, 
in concentration units, as R (see Figure B-3).
    (vii) Mix test atmospheres P and I by passing the total flow of both 
atmospheres through a mixing flask.
    (viii) Sample and measure this mixture. Record the stable reading, 
in concentration units, as RI.
    (ix) Calculate the interference equivalent (IE) as:

IE = RI-R


IE must be equal to or less than the specification given in table B-1 
for each interferent to pass the test.
    (x) Follow steps (iii) through (ix) of this section, in turn, to 
determine the interference equivalent for each interferent.
    (xi) For those interferents which cannot be mixed with the 
pollutant, as indicated by footnote (3) in table B-3, adjust the 
concentration of test atmosphere I to the specified value without being 
mixed or diluted by the pollutant test atmosphere. Determine IE as 
follows:
    (A) Sample and measure test atmosphere Z (zero air). Allow for a 
stable reading and record the reading, in concentration units, as R.
    (B) Sample and measure the interferent test atmosphere I. If the 
test analyzer is not capable of negative readings, adjust the analyzer 
(not the recorder) to give an offset zero. Record the stable reading in 
concentration units as RI, extrapolating the calibration curve, if 
necessary, to represent negative readings.
    (C) Calculate IE=R<INF>I</INF>-R. IE must be equal to or less than 
the specification in table B-1 to pass the test.
    (xii) Sum the absolute value of all the individual interference 
equivalents. This sum must be equal to or less than the total 
interferent specification given in table B-1 to pass the test.
    (e) Zero drift, span drift, lag time, rise time, fall time, and 
precision--(1) Technical definitions--(i) Zero drift: The change in 
response to zero pollutant concentration, over 12- and 24-hour periods 
of continuous unadjusted operation.
    (ii) Span drift: The percent change in response to an up-scale 
pollutant concentration over a 24-hour period of continuous unadjusted 
operation.
    (iii) Lag time: The time interval between a step change in input 
concentration and the first observable corresponding change in response.
    (iv) Rise time: The time interval between initial response and 95 
percent of final response after a step increase in input concentration.

[[Page 29]]

    (v) Fall time: The time interval between initial response and 95 
percent of final response after a step decrease in input concentration.
    (vi) Precision: Variation about the mean of repeated measurements of 
the same pollutant concentration, expressed as one standard deviation 
about the mean.
    (2) Tests for these performance parameters shall be accomplished 
over a period of seven (7) or more days. During this time, the line 
voltage supplied to the test analyzer and the ambient temperature 
surrounding the analyzer shall be varied from day to day. One test 
result for each performance parameter shall be obtained each test day, 
for seven (7) or fifteen (15) test days as necessary. The tests are 
performed sequentially in a single procedure.
    (3) The 24-hour test day may begin at any clock hour. The first 12 
hours out of each test day are required for testing 12-hour zero drift. 
Tests for the other parameters shall be conducted during the remaining 
12 hours.
    (4) Table B-4 specifies the line voltage and room temperature to be 
used for each test day. The line voltage and temperature shall be 
changed to the specified values at the start of each test day (i.e., at 
the start of the 12-hour zero test). Initial adjustments (day zero) 
shall be made at a line voltage of 115 volts (rms) and a room 
temperature of 25 [deg]C.
    (5) The tests shall be conducted in blocks consisting of 3 test days 
each until 7 or 15 test results have been obtained. (The final block may 
contain fewer than three test days.) If a test is interrupted by an 
occurrence other than a malfunction of the test analyzer, only the block 
during which the interruption occurred shall be repeated.
    (6) During each block, manual adjustments to the electronics, gas, 
or reagent flows or periodic maintenance shall not be permitted. 
Automatic adjustments which the test analyzer performs by itself are 
permitted at any time.
    (7) At least 4 hours prior to the start of the first test day of 
each block, the test analyzer may be adjusted and/or serviced according 
to the periodic maintenance procedures specified in the manual referred 
to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3). If a new block is to immediately follow a 
previous block, such adjustments or servicing may be done immediately 
after completion of the day's tests for the last day of the previous 
block and at the voltage and temperature specified for that day, but 
only on test days 3, 6, 9, and 12.

    Note: If necessary, the beginning of the test days succeeding such 
maintenance or adjustment may be delayed as necessary to complete the 
service or adjustment operation.

    (8) All response readings to be recorded shall first be converted to 
concentration units according to the calibration curve. Whenever a test 
atmosphere is to be measured but a stable reading is not required, the 
test atmosphere shall be measured long enough to cause a change in 
response of at least 10% of full scale. Identify all readings and other 
pertinent data on the strip chart. (See Figure B-1 illustrating the 
pattern of the required readings.)

Test atmospheres A<INF>0</INF>, A<INF>2</INF><INF>0</INF>, and 
A<INF>8</INF><INF>0</INF> shall be consistent during the tests and from 
day to day.
    (ii) For steps (xxv) through (xxxi) of this section, a chart speed

speed, chart speed changes, and time checks shall be clearly marked on 
the chart.
    (iii) Allow sufficient time for test analyzer to warm up and

    (xxxiv) Repeat steps (viii) through (xxxiii) of this section, each 
test day.
    (xxxv) If zero and span adjustments are made after the readings are 
taken on test days 3, 6, 9, or 12, complete all adjustments; then 
measure test atmospheres A<INF>0</INF>, A<INF>8</INF><INF>0</INF>, and 
A<INF>2</INF><INF>0</INF>. Allow for a stable reading on each, and 
record the readings as Z'<INF>n</INF>S'<INF>n</INF>, and M<INF>n</INF> 
respectively, where n = the test day number.
    (10) Determine the results of each day's tests as follows. Mark the 
recorder chart to show readings and determinations.
    (i) Zero drift. (A) 12-hour. Examine the strip chart pertaining to 
the 12-

[[Page 33]]

hour continuous zero air test. Determine the minimum (Cmin.) and maximum 
(Cmax.) readings (in p/m) during this period of 12 consecutive hours, 
extrapolating the calibration curve to negative concentration units if 
necessary. Determine the 12-hour zero drift (12ZD) as 12ZD = C\max.\-
C\min.\. (See Figure B-5 in appendix A.)
    (B) Calculate the 24-hour zero drift (24ZD) for the n-th test day as 
24ZD<INF>n</INF> = Z<INF>n</INF>-Z<INF>n-1</INF>, or 24ZD<INF>n</INF> = 
Z<INF>n</INF>-Z'<INF>n-1</INF> if zero adjustment was made on the 
previous day, where Z<INF>n</INF> = \1/2\(L<INF>1</INF>+L<INF>2</INF>) 
for L<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>2</INF> taken on the n-th test day.
    (C) Compare 12ZD and 24ZD to the zero drift specification in table 
B-1. Both 12ZD and 24ZD must be equal to or less than the specified 
value to pass the test for zero drift.
    (ii) Span drift. (A) Span drift at 20 percent of URL (MSD)

n-th test day.
    (C) Both USD and MSD must be equal to or less than the respective 
specifications given in table B-1 to pass the test for span draft.
    (iii) Lag time. Determine, from the strip chart, the elapsed time in 
minutes between the mark made in step (xxvi) and the first observable 
(two times the noise level) response. This time must be equal to or less 
than the time specified in table B-1 to pass the test for lag time.
    (iv) Rise time. Calculate 95 percent of reading P<INF>9</INF> and 
determine from the recorder chart, the elapsed time between the first 
observable (two times noise level) response and a response equal to 95 
percent of the P<INF>9</INF> reading. This time must be equal to or less 
than the rise time specified in table B-1 to pass the test for rise 
time.
    (v) Fall time. Calculate five percent of (P<INF>10</INF>-
L<INF>2</INF>) and determine, from the strip chart, the elapsed time in 
minutes between the first observable decrease in response following 
reading P<INF>10</INF> and a response equal to five percent of 
(P<INF>10</INF>-L<INF>2</INF>). This time must be equal to or less than 
the fall time specification in table B-1 to pass the test for fall time.
    (vi) Precision. Calculate precision (P<INF>2</INF><INF>0</INF> and 
P<INF>8</INF><INF>0</INF>) for each day's test as follows:

    (C) Both P<INF>2</INF><INF>0</INF> and P<INF>8</INF><INF>0</INF> 
must be equal to or less than the specification given in table B-1 to 
pass the test for precision.

  Subpart C_Procedures for Determining Comparability Between Candidate 

                      Methods and Reference Methods

    Source: 71 FR 61278, Oct. 17, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 53.30  General provisions.

    (a) Determination of comparability. The test procedures prescribed 
in this subpart shall be used to determine if a candidate method is 
comparable to a reference method when both methods measure pollutant 
concentrations in

[[Page 40]]

ambient air. Minor deviations in testing requirements and acceptance 
requirements set forth in this subpart, in connection with any 
documented extenuating circumstances, may be determined by the 
Administrator to be acceptable, at the discretion of the Administrator.
    (b) Selection of test sites. (1) Each test site shall be in an area 
which can be shown to have at least moderate concentrations of various 
pollutants. Each site shall be clearly identified and shall be justified 
as an appropriate test site with suitable supporting evidence such as a 
description of the surrounding area, characterization of the sources and 
pollutants typical in the area, maps, population density data, vehicular 
traffic data, emission inventories, pollutant measurements from previous 
years, concurrent pollutant measurements, meteorological data, and other 
information useful in supporting the suitability of the site for the 
comparison test or tests.
    (2) If approval of one or more proposed test sites is desired prior 
to conducting the tests, a written request for approval of the test site 
or sites must be submitted to the address given in Sec. 53.4. The 
request should include information identifying the type of candidate 
method and one or more specific proposed test sites along with a 
justification for each proposed specific site as described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. The EPA will evaluate each proposed site and 
approve the site, disapprove the site, or request more information about 
the site. Any such pre-test approval of a test site by the EPA shall 
indicate only that the site meets the applicable test site requirements 
for the candidate method type; it shall not indicate, suggest, or imply 
that test data obtained at the site will necessarily meet any of the 
applicable data acceptance requirements. The Administrator may exercise 
discretion in selecting a different site (or sites) for any additional 
tests the Administrator decides to conduct.
    (c) Test atmosphere. Ambient air sampled at an appropriate test site 
or sites shall be used for these tests. Simultaneous concentration 
measurements shall be made in each of the concentration ranges specified 
in tables C-1, C-3, or C-4 of this subpart, as appropriate.
    (d) Sampling or sample collection. All test concentration 
measurements or samples shall be taken in such a way that both the 
candidate method and the reference method obtain air samples that are 
alike or as nearly identical as practical.
    (e) Operation. Set-up and start-up of the test analyzer(s), test 
sampler(s), and reference method analyzers or samplers shall be in 
strict accordance with the applicable operation manual(s).
    (f) Calibration. The reference method shall be calibrated according 
to the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter (if it is a 
manual method) or according to the applicable operation manual(s) (if it 
is an automated method). A candidate method (or portion thereof) shall 
be calibrated according to the applicable operation manual(s), if such 
calibration is a part of the method.
    (g) Submission of test data and other information. All recorder 
charts, calibration data, records, test results, procedural descriptions 
and details, and other documentation obtained from (or pertinent to) 
these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing 
the test, and submitted. For candidate methods for PM<INF>2.5</INF> and 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF>, all submitted information must meet the 
requirements of the ANSI/ASQC E4 Standard, sections 6 (reference 1 of 
appendix A of this subpart).

Sec. 53.31  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 53.32  Test procedures for methods for SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, 

O<INF>3</INF>, and NO<INF>2</INF>.

    (a) Comparability. Comparability is shown for SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, 
O<INF>3</INF>, and NO<INF>2</INF> methods when the differences between:
    (1) Measurements made by a candidate manual method or by a test 
analyzer representative of a candidate automated method, and;
    (2) Measurements made simultaneously by a reference method are less 
than or equal to the values for maximum discrepancy specified in table 
C-1 of this subpart.
    (b) Test measurements. All test measurements are to be made at the 
same

[[Page 41]]

test site. If necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the sampled 
ambient air may be augmented with artificially generated pollutant to 
facilitate measurements in the specified ranges, as described under 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (c) Requirements for measurements or samples. All test measurements 
made or test samples collected by means of a sample manifold as 
specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section shall be at a room 
temperature between 20[deg] and 30 [deg]C, and at a line voltage between 
105 and 125 volts. All methods shall be calibrated as specified in Sec. 
53.30(f) prior to initiation of the tests.
    (d) Set-up and start-up. (1) Set-up and start-up of the test 
analyzer, test sampler(s), and reference method shall be in strict 
accordance with the applicable operation manual(s). If the test analyzer 
does not have an integral strip chart or digital data recorder, connect 
the analyzer output to a suitable strip chart or digital data recorder. 
This recorder shall have a chart width of at least 25 centimeters, a 
response time of 1 second or less, a deadband of not more than 0.25 
percent of full scale, and capability of either reading measurements at 
least 5 percent below zero or offsetting the zero by at least 5 percent. 
Digital data shall be recorded at appropriate time intervals such that 
trend plots similar to a strip chart recording may be constructed with a 
similar or suitable level of detail.
    (2) Other data acquisition components may be used along with the 
chart recorder during the conduct of these tests. Use of the chart 
recorder is intended only to facilitate visual evaluation of data 
submitted.
    (3) Allow adequate warmup or stabilization time as indicated in the 
applicable operation manual(s) before beginning the tests.
    (e) Range. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, each method shall be operated in the range specified for the 
reference method in the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter 
(for manual reference methods), or specified in table B-1 of subpart B 
of this part (for automated reference methods).
    (2) For a candidate method having more than one selectable range, 
one range must be that specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, 
and a test analyzer representative of the method must pass the tests 
required by this subpart while operated on that range. The tests may be 
repeated for a broader range (i.e., one extending to higher 
concentrations) than the one specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this 
part, provided that the range does not extend to concentrations more 
than two times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of subpart B 
of this part and that the test analyzer has passed the tests required by 
subpart B of this part (if applicable) for the broader range. If the 
tests required by this subpart are conducted or passed only for the 
range specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, any equivalent 
method determination with respect to the method will be limited to that 
range. If the tests are passed for both the specified range and a 
broader range (or ranges), any such determination will include the 
broader range(s) as well as the specified range. Appropriate test data 
shall be submitted for each range sought to be included in such a 
determination.
    (f) Operation of automated methods. (1) Once the test analyzer has 
been set up and calibrated and tests started, manual adjustment or 
normal periodic maintenance, as specified in the manual referred to in 
Sec. 53.4(b)(3), is permitted only every 3 days. Automatic adjustments 
which the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time. 
The submitted records shall show clearly when manual adjustments were 
made and describe the operations performed.
    (2) All test measurements shall be made with the same test analyzer; 
use of multiple test analyzers is not permitted. The test analyzer shall 
be operated continuously during the entire series of test measurements.
    (3) If a test analyzer should malfunction during any of these tests, 
the entire set of measurements shall be repeated, and a detailed 
explanation of the malfunction, remedial action taken, and whether 
recalibration was necessary (along with all pertinent records and 
charts) shall be submitted.
    (4) Ambient air shall be sampled from a common intake and 
distribution

[[Page 42]]

manifold designed to deliver homogenous air samples to both methods. 
Precautions shall be taken in the design and construction of this 
manifold to minimize the removal of particulate matter and trace gases, 
and to insure that identical samples reach the two methods. If 
necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the sampled ambient air may 
be augmented with artificially generated pollutant. However, at all 
times the air sample measured by the candidate and reference methods 
under test shall consist of not less than 80 percent ambient air by 
volume. Schematic drawings, physical illustrations, descriptions, and 
complete details of the manifold system and the augmentation system (if 
used) shall be submitted.
    (g) Tests. (1) Conduct the first set of simultaneous measurements 
with the candidate and reference methods:
    (i) Table C-1 of this subpart specifies the type (1-or 24-hour) and 
number of measurements to be made in each of the three test 
concentration ranges.
    (ii) The pollutant concentration must fall within the specified 
range as measured by the reference method.
    (iii) The measurements shall be made in the sequence specified in 
table C-2 of this subpart, except for the 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> 
measurements, which are all in the high range.
    (2) For each pair of measurements, determine the difference 
(discrepancy) between the candidate method measurement and reference 
method measurement. A discrepancy which exceeds the discrepancy 
specified in table C-1 of this subpart constitutes a failure. Figure C-1 
of this subpart contains a suggested format for reporting the test 
results.
    (3) The results of the first set of measurements shall be 
interpreted as follows:
    (i) Zero failures: The candidate method passes the test for 
comparability.
    (ii) Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for 
comparability.
    (iii) One or two failures: Conduct a second set of simultaneous 
measurements as specified in table C-1 of this subpart. The results of 
the combined total of first-set and second-set measurements shall be 
interpreted as follows:
    (A) One or two failures: The candidate method passes the test for 
comparability.
    (B) Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for 
comparability.
    (iv) For SO<INF>2</INF>, the 1-hour and 24-hour measurements shall 
be interpreted separately, and the candidate method must pass the tests 
for both 1- and 24-hour measurements to pass the test for comparability.
    (4) A 1-hour measurement consists of the integral of the 
instantaneous concentration over a 60-minute continuous period divided 
by the time period. Integration of the instantaneous concentration may 
be performed by any appropriate means such as chemical, electronic, 
mechanical, visual judgment, or by calculating the mean of not less than 
12 equally-spaced instantaneous readings. Appropriate allowances or 
corrections shall be made in cases where significant errors could occur 
due to characteristic lag time or rise/fall time differences between the 
candidate and reference methods. Details of the means of integration and 
any corrections shall be submitted.
    (5) A 24-hour measurement consists of the integral of the 
instantaneous concentration over a 24-hour continuous period divided by 
the time period. This integration may be performed by any appropriate 
means such as chemical, electronic, mechanical, or by calculating the 
mean of twenty-four (24) sequential 1-hour measurements.
    (6) For O<INF>3</INF> and CO, no more than six 1-hour measurements 
shall be made per day. For SO<INF>2</INF>, no more than four 1-hour 
measurements or one 24-hour measurement shall be made per day. One-hour 
measurements may be made concurrently with 24-hour measurements if 
appropriate.
    (7) For applicable methods, control or calibration checks may be 
performed once per day without adjusting the test analyzer or method. 
These checks may be used as a basis for a linear interpolation-type 
correction to be applied to the measurements to correct for drift. If 
such a correction is used, it shall be applied to all measurements

[[Page 43]]

made with the method, and the correction procedure shall become a part 
of the method.

Sec. 53.33  Test procedure for methods for Pb.

    (a) Comparability. Comparability is shown for Pb methods when the 
differences between:
    (1) Measurements made by a candidate method, and
    (2) Measurements made by the reference method on simultaneously 
collected Pb samples (or the same sample, if applicable), are less than 
or equal to the value specified in table C-3 of this subpart.
    (b) Test measurements. Test measurements may be made at any number 
of test sites. Augmentation of pollutant concentrations is not 
permitted, hence an appropriate test site or sites must be selected to 
provide Pb concentrations in the specified range.
    (c) Collocated samplers. The ambient air intake points of all the 
candidate and reference method collocated samplers shall be positioned 
at the same height above the ground level, and between 2 meters (1 meter 
for samplers with flow rates less than 200 liters per minute (L/min)) 
and 4 meters apart. The samplers shall be oriented in a manner that will 
minimize spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection.
    (d) Sample collection. Collect simultaneous 24-hour samples 
(filters) of Pb at the test site or sites with both the reference and 
candidate methods until at least 10 filter pairs have been obtained. A 
candidate method which employs a sampler and sample collection procedure 
that are identical to the sampler and sample collection procedure 
specified in the reference method, but uses a different analytical 
procedure, may be tested by analyzing common samples. The common samples 
shall be collected according to the sample collection procedure 
specified by the reference method and each shall be divided for 
respective analysis in accordance with the analytical procedures of the 
candidate method and the reference method.
    (e) Audit samples. Three audit samples must be obtained from the 
address given in Sec. 53.4(a). The audit samples are \3/4\ x 8-inch 
glass fiber strips containing known amounts of Pb at the following 
nominal levels: 100 micrograms per strip ([micro]g/strip); 300 [micro]g/
strip; 750 [micro]g/strip. The true amount of Pb, in total [micro]g/
strip, will be provided with each audit sample.
    (f) Filter analysis. (1) For both the reference method samples and 
the audit samples, analyze each filter extract three times in accordance 
with the reference method analytical procedure. The analysis of 
replicates should not be performed sequentially, i.e., a single sample 
should not be analyzed three times in sequence. Calculate the indicated 
Pb concentrations for the reference method samples in micrograms per 
cubic meter ([micro]g/m\3\) for each analysis of each filter. Calculate 
the indicated total Pb amount for the audit samples in [micro]g/strip 
for each analysis of each strip. Label these test results as 
R<INF>1A</INF>, R<INF>1B</INF>, R<INF>1C</INF>, R<INF>2A</INF>, 
R<INF>2B</INF>, * * *, Q<INF>1A</INF>, Q<INF>1B</INF>, Q<INF>1C</INF>, * 
* *, where R denotes results from the reference method samples; Q 
denotes results from the audit samples; 1, 2, 3 indicate the filter 
number, and A, B, C indicate the first, second, and third analysis of 
each filter, respectively.
    (2) For the candidate method samples, analyze each sample filter or 
filter extract three times and calculate, in accordance with the 
candidate method, the indicated Pb concentration in [micro]g/m\3\ for 
each analysis of each filter. Label these test results as 
C<INF>1A</INF>, C<INF>1B</INF>, C<INF>2C</INF>, * * *, where C denotes 
results from the candidate method. For candidate methods which provide a 
direct measurement of Pb concentrations without a separable procedure, 
C<INF>1A</INF>=C<INF>1B</INF>=C<INF>1C</INF>, 
C<INF>2A</INF>=C<INF>2B</INF>=C<INF>2C</INF>, etc.
    (g) Average Pb concentration. For the reference method, calculate 
the average Pb concentration for each filter by averaging the 
concentrations calculated from the three analyses using equation 1 of 
this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.015

Where, i is the filter number.

    (h) Accuracy. (1)(i) For the audit samples, calculate the average Pb 
concentration for each strip by averaging

[[Page 44]]

the concentrations calculated from the three analyses using equation 2 
of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.016

Where, i is audit sample number.

    (ii) Calculate the percent difference (D<INF>q</INF>) between the 
indicated Pb concentration for each audit sample and the true Pb 
concentration (T<INF>q</INF>) using equation 3 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.017

    (2) If any difference value (D<INF>qi</INF>) exceeds <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent, the accuracy of the reference method 
analytical procedure is out-of-control. Corrective action must be taken 
to determine the source of the error(s) (e.g., calibration standard 
discrepancies, extraction problems, etc.) and the reference method and 
audit sample determinations must be repeated according to paragraph (f) 
of this section, or the entire test procedure (starting with paragraph 
(d) of this section) must be repeated.
    (i) Acceptable filter pairs. Disregard all filter pairs for which 
the Pb concentration, as determined in paragraph (g) of this section by 
the average of the three reference method determinations, falls outside 
the range of 0.5 to 4.0 [micro]g/m\3\. All remaining filter pairs must 
be subjected to the tests for precision and comparability in paragraphs 
(j) and (k) of this section. At least five filter pairs must be within 
the 0.5 to 4.0 [micro]g/m\3\ range for the tests to be valid.
    (j) Test for precision. (1) Calculate the precision (P) of the 
analysis (in percent) for each filter and for each method, as the 
maximum minus the minimum divided by the average of the three 
concentration values, using equation 4 or equation 5 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.018


 or
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.019

 where, i indicates the filter number.

    (2) If any reference method precision value (P<INF>Ri</INF>) exceeds 
15 percent, the precision of the reference method analytical procedure 
is out-of-control. Corrective action must be taken to determine the 
source(s) of imprecision, and the reference method determinations must 
be repeated according to paragraph (f) of this section, or the entire 
test procedure (starting with paragraph (d) of this section) must be 
repeated.
    (3) If any candidate method precision value (P<INF>Ci</INF>) exceeds 
15 percent, the candidate method fails the precision test.
    (4) The candidate method passes this test if all precision values 
(i.e., all P<INF>Ri</INF>'s and all P<INF>Ci</INF>'s) are less than 15 
percent.
    (k) Test for comparability. (1) For each filter or analytical sample 
pair, calculate all nine possible percent differences (D) between the 
reference and candidate methods, using all nine possible combinations of 
the three determinations (A, B, and C) for each method using equation 6 
of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.020

 where, i is the filter number, and n numbers from 1 to 9 for the nine 
          possible difference combinations for the three determinations 
          for each method (j = A, B, C, candidate; k = A, B, C, 
          reference).

    (2) If none of the percent differences (D) exceeds <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>20 percent, the candidate method passes the test for 
comparability.
    (3) If one or more of the percent differences (D) exceed <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>20 percent, the candidate method fails the test for 
comparability.
    (4) The candidate method must pass both the precision test 
(paragraph (j) of this section) and the comparability test (paragraph 
(k) of this section) to qualify for designation as an equivalent method.

Sec. 53.34  Test procedure for methods for PM10 and Class I methods for 

PM2.5.

    (a) Comparability. Comparability is shown for PM<INF>10</INF> 
methods and for Class I methods for PM<INF>2.5</INF> when the 
relationship between:
    (1) Measurements made by a candidate method, and
    (2) Measurements made by a corresponding reference method on 
simultaneously collected samples (or the same sample, if applicable) at 
each of one or more test sites (as required) is such that the linear 
regression parameters (slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient) 
describing the relationship meet the requirements specified in table C-4 
of this subpart.
    (b) Methods for PM10. Test measurements must be made, or derived 
from particulate samples collected, at not less than two test sites, 
each of which must be located in a geographical area characterized by 
ambient particulate matter that is significantly different in nature and 
composition from that at the other test site(s). Augmentation of 
pollutant concentrations is not permitted, hence appropriate test sites 
must be selected to provide the minimum number of test PM<INF>10</INF> 
concentrations in the ranges specified in table C-4 of this subpart. The 
tests at the two sites may be conducted in different calendar seasons, 
if appropriate, to provide PM<INF>10</INF> concentrations in the 
specified ranges.
    (c) PM10 methods employing the same sampling procedure as the 
reference method but a different analytical method. Candidate methods 
for PM<INF>10</INF> which employ a sampler and sample collection 
procedure that are identical to the sampler and sample collection 
procedure specified in the reference method, but use a different 
analytical procedure, may be tested by analyzing common samples. The 
common samples shall be collected according to the sample collection 
procedure specified by the reference method and shall be analyzed in 
accordance with the analytical procedures of both the candidate method 
and the reference method.
    (d) Methods for PM2.5. Augmentation of pollutant concentrations is 
not permitted, hence appropriate test sites must be selected to provide 
the minimum number of test measurement sets to meet the requirements for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentrations in the ranges specified in table C-4 of 
this subpart. Only one test site is required, and the site need only 
meet the PM<INF>2.5</INF> ambient concentration levels required by table 
C-4 of this subpart and the requirements of Sec. 53.30(b) of this 
subpart. A total of 10 valid measurement sets is required.
    (e) Collocated measurements. (1) Set up three reference method 
samplers collocated with three candidate method samplers or analyzers at 
each of the number of test sites specified in table C-4 of this subpart.
    (2) The ambient air intake points of all the candidate and reference 
method collocated samplers or analyzers shall be positioned at the same 
height above the ground level, and between 2 meters (1 meter for 
samplers or analyzers with flow rates less than 200 L/min) and 4 meters 
apart. The samplers shall be oriented in a manner that will minimize 
spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection.
    (3) At each site, obtain as many sets of simultaneous 
PM<INF>10</INF> or PM<INF>2.5</INF> measurements as necessary (see table 
C-4 of this subpart), each set consisting of three reference method and 
three candidate method measurements, all obtained simultaneously.
    (4) Candidate PM<INF>10</INF> method measurements shall be nominal 
24-hour (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 hour) integrated measurements or shall 
be averaged to obtain the mean concentration for a nominal 24-hour 
period. PM<INF>2.5</INF> measurements may be either nominal 24-or 48-
hour integrated measurements. All collocated measurements in a 
measurement set must cover the same nominal 24-or 48-hour time period.
    (5) For samplers, retrieve the samples promptly after sample 
collection and analyze each sample according to the reference method or 
candidate method, as appropriate, and determine the PM<INF>10</INF> or 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentration in [micro]g/m\3\. If the conditions of 
paragraph (c) of this section apply, collect sample sets only with the 
three reference method samplers. Guidance for quality assurance 
procedures for PM<INF>2.5</INF> methods is found in ``Quality Assurance 
Document 2.12'' (reference (2) in appendix A to this subpart).

[[Page 46]]

    (f) Sequential samplers. For sequential samplers, the sampler shall 
be configured for the maximum number of sequential samples and shall be 
set for automatic collection of all samples sequentially such that the 
test samples are collected equally, to the extent possible, among all 
available sequential channels or utilizing the full available sequential 
capability.
    (g) Calculation of reference method averages and precisions. (1) For 
each of the measurement sets, calculate the average PM<INF>10</INF> or 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentration obtained with the reference method 
samplers, using equation 7 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.021

Where:
R = The concentration measurements from the reference methods;
i = The sampler number; and
j = The measurement set number.

    (2) For each of the measurement sets, calculate the precision of the 
reference method PM<INF>10</INF> or PM<INF>2.5</INF> measurements as the 
standard deviation, P<INF>Rj</INF>, using equation 8 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.022

    (3) For each measurement set, also calculate the precision of the 
reference method PM<INF>10</INF> or PM<INF>2.5</INF> measurements as the 
relative standard deviation, RP<INF>Rj</INF>, in percent, using equation 
9 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.023

    (h) Acceptability of measurement sets. Each measurement set is 
acceptable and valid only if the three reference method measurements and 
the three candidate method measurements are obtained and are valid, 
R<INF>j</INF> falls within the acceptable concentration range specified 
in table C-4 of this subpart, and either P<INF>Rj</INF> or 
RP<INF>Rj</INF> is within the corresponding limit for reference method 
precision specified in table C-4 of this subpart. For each site, table 
C-4 of this subpart specifies the minimum number of measurement sets 
required having R<INF>j</INF> above and below specified concentrations 
for 24- or 48-hour samples. Additional measurement sets shall be 
obtained, as necessary, to provide the minimum number of acceptable 
measurement sets for each category and the minimum total number of 
acceptable measurement sets for each test site. If more than the minimum 
number of measurement sets are collected that meet the acceptability 
criteria, all such measurement sets shall be used to demonstrate 
comparability.
    (i) Candidate method average concentration measurement. For each of 
the acceptable measurement sets, calculate the average PM<INF>10</INF> 
or PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentration measurements obtained with the 
candidate method samplers, using equation 10 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.024

Where:

C = The concentration measurements from the candidate methods;
i = The measurement number in the set; and
j = The measurement set number.

    (j) Test for comparability. (1) For each site, plot all of the 
average PM<INF>10</INF> or PM<INF>2.5</INF> measurements obtained with 
the candidate method (C<INF>j</INF>) against the corresponding average 
PM<INF>10</INF> or PM<INF>2.5</INF> measurements obtained with the 
reference method (R<INF>j</INF>. For each site, calculate and record the 
linear regression slope and intercept, and the correlation coefficient.
    (2) To pass the test for comparability, the slope, intercept, and 
correlation coefficient calculated under paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section must be within the limits specified in table C-4 of this subpart 
for all test sites.

<R05>
Sec. 53.35  Test procedure for Class II and Class III methods for 
PM2.5 and PM10-2.5.

    (a) Overview. Class II and Class III candidate equivalent methods 
shall be tested for comparability of PM<INF>2.5</INF> or 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> measurements to corresponding collocated 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> reference method measurements at 
each of multiple field sites, as required. Comparability is shown for 
the candidate method when simultaneous collocated measurements made by 
candidate and reference methods meet the comparability requirements 
specified in this section Sec. 53.35 and in table C-4 of this subpart 
at each of the required test sites.
    (b) Test sites and seasons. A summary of the test site and seasonal 
testing requirements is presented in table C-5 of this subpart.
    (1) Test sites. Comparability testing is required at each of the 
applicable U.S. test sites required by this paragraph (b). Each test 
site must also meet the general test site requirements specified in 
Sec. 53.30(b).
    (i) PM2.5 Class II and Class III candidate methods. Test sites 
should be chosen to provide representative chemical and meteorological 
characteristics with respect to nitrates, sulfates, organic compounds, 
and various levels of temperature, humidity, wind, and elevation. For 
Class III methods, one test site shall be selected in each of the 
following four general locations (A, B, C, and D). For Class II methods, 
two test sites, one western site (A or B) and one midwestern or eastern 
site (C or D), shall be selected from these locations.
    (A) Test site A shall be in the Los Angeles basin or California 
Central Valley area in a location that is characterized by relatively 
high PM<INF>2.5</INF>, nitrates, and semi-volatile organic pollutants.
    (B) Test site B shall be in a western city such as Denver, Salt Lake 
City, or Albuquerque in an area characterized by cold weather, higher 
elevation, winds, and dust.
    (C) Test site C shall be in a midwestern city characterized by 
substantial temperature variation, high nitrates, and wintertime 
conditions.
    (D) Test site D shall be in a northeastern or mid-Atlantic city that 
is seasonally characterized by high sulfate concentrations and high 
relative humidity.
    (ii) PM10-2.5 Class II and Class III candidate methods. Test sites 
shall be chosen to provide modest to high levels of PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> 
representative of locations in proximity to urban sources of 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> such as high-density traffic on paved roads, 
industrial sources, and construction activities. For Class III methods, 
one test site shall be selected in each of the four following general 
locations (A, B, C, and D), and at least one of the test sites shall 
have characteristic wintertime temperatures of 0 [deg]C or lower. For 
Class II methods, two test sites, one western site (A or B) and one 
midwestern or eastern site (C or D), shall be selected from these 
locations.
    (A) Test site A shall be in the Los Angeles basin or the California 
Central Valley area in a location that is characterized by relatively 
high PM<INF>2.5</INF>, nitrates, and semi-volatile organic pollutants.
    (B) Test site B shall be in a western city characterized by a high 
ratio of PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> to PM<INF>2.5</INF>, with exposure to 
windblown dust, such as Las Vegas or Phoenix.
    (C) Test site C shall be in a midwestern city characterized by 
substantial temperature variation, high nitrates, and wintertime 
conditions.
    (D) Test site D shall be in a large city east of the Mississippi 
River, having characteristically high sulfate concentrations and high 
humidity levels.
    (2) Test seasons. (i) For PM<INF>2.5</INF> and PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> 
Class III candidate methods, test campaigns are required in both summer 
and winter seasons at test site A, in the winter season only at test 
sites B and C, and in the summer season only at test site D. (A total of 
five test campaigns is required.) The summer season shall be defined as 
the typically warmest three or four months of the year at the site; the 
winter season shall be defined as the typically coolest three or four 
months of the year at the site.
    (ii) For Class II PM<INF>2.5</INF> and PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> candidate 
methods, one test campaign is required at test site A or B and a second 
test campaign at test site C or D (total of two test campaigns).

[[Page 48]]

    (3) Test concentrations. The test sites should be selected to 
provide ambient concentrations within the concentration limits specified 
in table C-4 of this subpart, and also to provide a wide range of test 
concentrations. A narrow range of test concentrations may result in a 
low concentration coefficient of variation statistic for the test 
measurements, making the test for correlation coefficient more difficult 
to pass (see paragraph (h) of this section, test for comparison 
correlation).
    (4) Pre-approval of test sites. The EPA recommends that the 
applicant seek EPA approval of each proposed test site prior to 
conducting test measurements at the site. To do so, the applicant should 
submit a request for approval as described in Sec. 53.30(b)(2).
    (c) Collocated measurements. (1) For each test campaign, three 
reference method samplers and three candidate method samplers or 
analyzers shall be installed and operated concurrently at each test site 
within each required season (if applicable), as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section. All reference method samplers shall be of single-
filter design (not multi-filter, sequential sample design). Each 
candidate method shall be setup and operated in accordance with its 
associated manual referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3) and in accordance with 
applicable guidance in ``Quality Assurance Document 2.12'' (reference 
(2) in appendix A to this subpart). All samplers or analyzers shall be 
placed so that they sample or measure air representative of the 
surrounding area (within one kilometer) and are not unduly affected by 
adjacent buildings, air handling equipment, industrial operations, 
traffic, or other local influences. The ambient air inlet points of all 
samplers and analyzers shall be positioned at the same height above the 
ground level and between 2 meters (1 meter for instruments having sample 
inlet flow rates less than 200 L/min) and 4 meters apart.
    (2) A minimum of 23 valid and acceptable measurement sets of 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> 24-hour (nominal) concurrent 
concentration measurements shall be obtained during each test campaign 
at each test site. To be considered acceptable for the test, each 
measurement set shall consist of at least two valid reference method 
measurements and at least two valid candidate method measurements, and 
the PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> measured concentration, as 
determined by the average of the reference method measurements, must 
fall within the acceptable concentration range specified in table C-4 of 
this subpart. Each measurement set shall include all valid measurements 
obtained. For each measurement set containing fewer than three reference 
method measurements or fewer than three candidate method measurements, 
an explanation and appropriate justification shall be provided to 
account for the missing measurement or measurements.
    (3) More than 23 valid measurement sets may be obtained during a 
particular test campaign to provide a more advantageous range of 
concentrations, more representative conditions, additional higher or 
lower measurements, or to otherwise improve the comparison of the 
methods. All valid data sets obtained during each test campaign shall be 
submitted and shall be included in the analysis of the data.
    (4) The integrated-sample reference method measurements shall be of 
at least 22 hours and not more than 25 hours duration. Each reference 
method sample shall be retrieved promptly after sample collection and 
analyzed according to the reference method to determine the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> measured concentration in 
[micro]g/m\3\. Guidance and quality assurance procedures applicable to 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> reference methods are found in 
``Quality Assurance Document 2.12'' (reference (2) in appendix A to this 
subpart).
    (5) Candidate method measurements shall be timed or processed and 
averaged as appropriate to determine an equivalent mean concentration 
representative of the same time period as that of the concurrent 
integrated-sample reference method measurements, such that all 
measurements in a measurement set shall be representative of the same 
time period. In addition, hourly average concentration measurements 
shall be obtained from each of the Class III candidate method analyzers 
for each valid measurement set and submitted as part of the application 
records.

[[Page 49]]

    (6) In the following tests, all measurement sets obtained at a 
particular test site, from both seasonal campaigns if applicable, shall 
be combined and included in the test data analysis for the site. Data 
obtained at different test sites shall be analyzed separately. All 
measurements should be reported as normally obtained, and no measurement 
values should be rounded or truncated prior to data analysis. In 
particular, no negative measurement value, if otherwise apparently 
valid, should be modified, adjusted, replaced, or eliminated merely 
because its value is negative. Calculated mean concentrations or 
calculated intermediate quantities should retain at least one order-of-
magnitude greater resolution than the input values. All measurement data 
and calculations shall be recorded and submitted in accordance with 
Sec. 53.30(g), including hourly test measurements obtained from Class 
III candidate methods.
    (d) Calculation of mean concentrations--(1) Reference method outlier 
test. For each of the measurement sets for each test site, check each 
reference method measurement to see if it might be an anomalous value 
(outlier) as follows, where R<INF>i,j</INF> is the measurement of 
reference method sampler i on test day j. In the event that one of the 
reference method measurements is missing or invalid due to a specific, 
positively-identified physical cause (e.g., sampler malfunction, 
operator error, accidental damage to the filter, etc.; see paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section), then substitute zero for the missing 
measurement, for the purposes of this outlier test only.
    (i) Calculate the quantities 2 x R<INF>1,j</INF>/(R<INF>1,j</INF> + 
R<INF>2,j</INF>) and 2 x R<INF>1,j</INF>/(R<INF>1,j</INF> + 
R<INF>3,j</INF>). If both quantities fall outside of the interval, 
(0.93, 1.07), then R<INF>1,j</INF> is an outlier.
    (ii) Calculate the quantities 2 x R<INF>2,j</INF>/(R<INF>2,j</INF> + 
R<INF>1,j</INF>) and 2 x R<INF>2,j</INF>/(R<INF>2,j</INF> + 
R<INF>3,j</INF>). If both quantities fall outside of the interval, 
(0.93, 1.07), then R<INF>2,j</INF> is an outlier.
    (iii) Calculate the quantities 2 x R<INF>3,j</INF>/(R<INF>3,j</INF> 
+ R<INF>1,j</INF>) and 2 x R<INF>3,j</INF>/(R<INF>3,j</INF> + 
R<INF>2,j</INF>). If both quantities fall outside of the interval, 
(0.93, 1.07), then R<INF>3,j</INF> is an outlier.
    (iv) If this test indicates that one of the reference method 
measurements in the measurement set is an outlier, the outlier 
measurement shall be eliminated from the measurement set, and the other 
two measurements considered valid. If the test indicates that more than 
one reference method measurement in the measurement set is an outlier, 
the entire measurement set (both reference and candidate method 
measurements) shall be excluded from further data analysis for the tests 
of this section.
    (2) For each of the measurement sets for each test site, calculate 
the mean concentration for the reference method measurements, using 
equation 11 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.025

Where:

R<INF>j</INF> = The mean concentration measured by the reference method 
for the measurement set;
R<INF>i,j</INF> = The measurement of reference method sampler i on test 
day j; and
n = The number of valid reference method measurements in the measurement 
set (normally 3).

    (3) Any measurement set for which R<INF>j</INF> does not fall in the 
acceptable concentration range specified in table C-4 of this subpart is 
not valid, and the entire measurement set (both reference and candidate 
method measurements) must be eliminated from further data analysis.
    (4) For each of the valid measurement sets at each test site, 
calculate the mean concentration for the candidate method measurements, 
using equation 12 of this section. (The outlier test in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section shall not be applied to the candidate method 
measurements.)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.026

Where:

C<INF>j</INF> = The mean concentration measured by the candidate method 
for the measurement set;

[[Page 50]]

C<INF>i,j</INF> = The measurement of the candidate method sampler or 
analyzer i on test day j; and
m = The number of valid candidate method measurements in the measurement 
set (normally 3).

    (e) Test for reference method precision. (1) For each of the 
measurement sets for each site, calculate an estimate for the relative 
precision of the reference method measurements, RP<INF>j</INF>, using 
equation 13 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.027

    (2) For each site, calculate an estimate of reference method 
relative precision for the site, RP, using the root mean square 
calculation of equation 14 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.028

Where, J is the total number of valid measurement sets for the site.

    (3) Verify that the estimate for reference method relative precision 
for the site, RP, is not greater than the value specified for reference 
method precision in table C-4 of this subpart. A reference method 
relative precision greater than the value specified in table C-4 of this 
subpart indicates that quality control for the reference method is 
inadequate, and corrective measures must be implemented before 
proceeding with the test.
    (f) Test for candidate method precision. (1) For each of the 
measurement sets, for each site, calculate an estimate for the relative 
precision of the candidate method measurements, CP<INF>j,</INF> using 
equation 15 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.029

    (2) For each site, calculate an estimate of candidate method 
relative precision for the site, CP, using the root mean square 
calculation of equation 16 of this section:

Subpart D_Procedures for Testing Performance Characteristics of Methods 

                           for PM<INF>10</INF>

    Source: 52 FR 24729, July 1, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 53.40  General provisions.

    (a) The test procedures prescribed in this subpart shall be used to 
test the performance of candidate methods for PM<INF>10</INF> against 
the performance specifications given in table D-1. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, a test sampler or samplers representative 
of the sampler described in the candidate method must exhibit 
performance better than, or equal to, the specified value for each 
performance parameter, to satisfy the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) For a candidate method using a PM<INF>10</INF> sampler 
previously approved as part of a designated PM<INF>10</INF> method, only 
the test for precision need be conducted and passed to satisfy the 
requirements of this subpart. For a candidate method using a 
PM<INF>10</INF> sampler inlet previously approved as part of a 
designated PM<INF>10</INF> method, the tests for precision and flow rate 
stability must be conducted and passed to satisfy the requirements of 
this subpart; the tests for sampling effectiveness and 50 percent 
cutpoint need not be conducted if suitable rationale is provided to 
demonstrate that test results submitted for the previously approved 
method are applicable to the candidate method.

[[Page 68]]

    (c) The liquid particle sampling effectiveness and 50 percent 
cutpoint of a test sampler shall be determined in a wind tunnel using 10 
particle sizes and three wind speeds as specified in table D-2. A 
minimum of 3 replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness shall be 
required for each of the 30 test conditions for a minimum of 90 test 
measurements.
    (d) For the liquid particle sampling effectiveness parameter, a 
smooth curve plot shall be constructed of sampling effectiveness 
(percent) versus aerodynamic particle diameter ([micro]m) for each of 
the three wind speeds. These plots shall be used to calculate the 
expected mass concentration for the test sampler, using the procedure in 
Sec. 53.43(a). The candidate method passes the liquid particle sampling 
effectiveness test if the expected mass concentration calculated for the 
test sampler at each wind speed differs by no more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent from that predicted for the ``ideal'' 
sampler.*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * The sampling effectiveness curve for this ``ideal'' sampler is 
described by column 5 of table D-3 and is based on a model that 
approximates the penetration of particles into the human respiratory 
tract. Additional information on this model may be found in a document 
entitled, ``Particle Collection Criteria for 10 Micrometer Samplers,'' 
which is available from the Quality Assurance Division (MD-77), 
Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory, U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) For the 50 percent cutpoint parameter, the test result for each 
wind speed shall be reported as the particle size at which the curve 
specified in Sec. 53.40(d) crosses the 50 percent effectiveness line. 
The candidate method passes the 50 percent cutpoint test if the test 
result at each wind speed falls within 10<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 
[micro]m.
    (f) The solid particle sampling effectiveness of a test sampler 
shall be determined in a wind tunnel using 25 [micro]m particles at 2 
wind speeds as specified in table D-2. A minimum of three replicate 
measurements of sampling effectiveness for the 25 [micro]m solid 
particles shall be required at both wind speeds for a minimum of 6 test 
measurements.
    (g) For the solid particle sampling effectiveness parameter, the 
test result for each wind speed shall be reported as the difference 
between the average of the replicate sampling effectiveness measurements 
obtained for the 25 [micro]m solid particles and the average of the 
replicate measurements obtained for the 25 [micro]m liquid particles. 
The candidate method passes the solid particle sampling effectiveness 
test if the test result for each wind speed is less than, or equal to, 5 
percent.
    (h) The precision and flow rate stability of three identical test 
samplers shall be determined at a suitable test site by simultaneously 
sampling the PM<INF>10</INF> concentration of the atmosphere for 10 
periods of 24 hours.
    (i) For the precision parameter, the test result for each of the 10 
periods of 24 hours shall be calculated using the procedure in Sec. 
53.43(c). The candidate method passes the precision test if all of the 
test results meet the specifications in table D-1.
    (j) For the flow rate stability parameter, the test results for each 
of the three test samplers and for each of the 10 periods of 24 hours 
shall be calculated using the procedure in Sec. 53.43(d). The candidate 
method passes the flow rate stability test if all of the test results 
meet the specifications in table D-1.
    (k) All test data and other documentation obtained from or pertinent 
to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst 
performing the test, and submitted to EPA.

Sec. 53.41  Test conditions.

    (a) Set-up and start-up of all test samplers shall be in strict 
accordance with the operating instructions specified in the manual 
referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3).
    (b) If the internal surface or surfaces of the candidate method's 
sampler inlet on which the particles removed by the inlet are collected 
is a dry surface (i.e., not normally coated with oil or grease), those 
surfaces shall be cleaned prior to conducting wind tunnel tests with 
solid particles.
    (c) Once the test sampler or samplers have been set up and the 
performance tests started, manual adjustment shall be permitted only 
between test points for the sampling effectiveness and 50 percent 
cutpoint tests or between test days for the precision and flow rate 
stability tests. The manual adjustments and any periodic maintenance 
shall be limited to only those procedures prescribed in the manual 
referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3). The submitted records shall show 
clearly when any manual adjustment or periodic maintenance was made and 
shall describe the operations performed.
    (d) If a test sampler malfunctions during any of the sampling 
effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint tests, that test run shall be 
repeated. If a test sampler malfunctions during any of the precision and 
flow rate stability tests, that day's test shall be repeated. A detailed 
explanation of all malfunctions and the remedial actions taken shall be 
submitted to EPA with the application.

Sec. 53.42  Generation of test atmospheres for wind tunnel tests.

    (a) A vibrating orifice aerosol generator shall be used to produce 
monodispersed liquid particles of oleic acid tagged with uranine dye and 
monodispersed solid particles of ammonium fluoroscein with equivalent 
aerodynamic diameters as specified in table D-2. The geometric standard 
deviation for each particle size and type generated shall not exceed 1.1 
(for primary particles) and the proportion of multiplets (doublets and 
triplets) in a test particle atmosphere shall not exceed 10 percent. The 
particle delivery system shall consist of a blower system and a wind 
tunnel having a test section of sufficiently large cross-sectional area 
such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, as installed in the test 
section for testing, blocks no more than 15 percent of that area. To be 
acceptable, the blower system must be capable of achieving uniform wind 
speeds at the speeds specified in table D-2.

aerodynamic diameter. The particle size, as established by the operating 
parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator, shall be within 
the tolerance specified in table D-2. The precision of the particle size 
verification technique shall be 0.5 [micro]m or better, and particle 
size determined by the verification technique shall not differ by more 
than 0.5 [micro]m or 10 percent, whichever is higher, from that 
established by the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol 
generator.
    (c) The population of multiplets in a test particle atmosphere shall 
be determined during the tests and shall not exceed 10 percent. Solid 
particles shall be checked for dryness and evidence of breakage or 
agglomeration during the microscopic examination. If the solid particles 
in a test atmosphere are wet or show evidence of significant breakage or 
agglomeration ([micro]5 percent), the solid particle test atmosphere is 
unacceptable for purposes of these tests.
    (d) The concentration of particles in the wind tunnel is not 
critical. However, the cross-sectional uniformity of the particle 
concentration in the sampling zone of the test section shall be 
established during the tests using isokinetic samplers. An array of not 
less than five evenly spaced isokinetic samplers shall be used to 
determine the particle concentration uniformity in the sampling zone. If 
the particle concentration measured by any single isokinetic sampler in 
the sampling zone differs by more than 10 percent from the mean 
concentration, the particle delivery system is unacceptable in terms of 
uniformity of particle concentration. The sampling zone shall be a 
rectangular area having a horizontal dimension not less than 1.2 times 
the width of the test sampler at its inlet opening and a vertical 
dimension not less than 25 centimeters. The sampling zone is an area in 
the test section of the wind tunnel that is horizontally and vertically 
symmetrical with respect to the test sampler inlet opening.
    (e) The wind speed in the wind tunnel shall be determined during the 
tests using an appropriate technique capable of a precision of 5 percent 
or better (e.g., hot-wire anemometry). The mean wind speed in the test 
section of the wind tunnel during the tests shall be within 10 percent 
of the value specified in table D-2. The wind speed measured at any test 
point in the test section shall not differ by more than 10 percent from 
the mean wind speed in the test section. The turbulence intensity 
(longitudinal component and macroscale) in the test section shall be 
determined during the tests using an appropriate technique (e.g., hot-
wire anemometry).
    (f) The accuracy of all flow measurements used to calculate the test 
atmosphere concentrations and the test results shall be documented to be 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent, referenced to a primary 
standard. Any flow measurement corrections shall be clearly shown. All 
flow measurements shall be given in actual volumetric units.
    (g) Schematic drawings of the particle delivery system (wind tunnel 
and blower system) and other information showing complete procedural 
details of the test atmosphere generation, verification, and delivery 
techniques shall be submitted to EPA. All pertinent calculations shall 
be clearly presented.

Sec. 53.43  Test procedures.

    (a) Sampling effectiveness--(1) Technical definition. The ratio 
(expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a 
given size reaching the sampler filter or filters to the mass 
concentration of particles of the same size approaching the sampler.
    (2) Test procedure. (i) Establish a wind speed specified in table D-
2 and measure the wind speed and turbulence intensity (longitudinal 
component and macroscale) at a minimum of 12 test points in a cross-
sectional area of the test section of the wind tunnel. The mean wind 
speed in the test section must be within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 
percent of the value specified in table D-2 and the variation at any 
test point in the test section may not exceed 10 percent of the mean.
    (ii) Generate particles of a size and type specified in table D-2 
using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator. Check for the presence of 
satellites and adjust the generator as necessary. Calculate the 
aerodynamic particle size

[[Page 71]]

using the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol 
generator and record. The calculated aerodynamic diameter must be within 
the tolerance specified in table D-2.
    (iii) Collect a sample of the particles on a glass slide or other 
suitable substrate at the particle injection point. If a glass slide is 
used, it should be pretreated with an appropriate oleophobic surfactant 
when collecting liquid particles. Use a microscopic technique to size a 
minimum of 25 primary particles in three viewing fields (do not include 
multiplets). Determine the geometric mean aerodynamic diameter and 
geometric standard deviation using the bulk density of the particle type 
(and an appropriate flattening factor for liquid particles if collected 
on a glass slide). The measured geometric mean aerodynamic diameter must 
be within 0.5 [micro]m or 10 percent of the aerodynamic diameter 
calculated from the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice 
aerosol generator. The geometric standard deviation must not exceed 1.1.
    (iv) Determine the population of multiplets (doublets and triplets) 
in the collected sample by counting a minimum of 100 particles in three 
viewing fields. The multiplet population of the particle test atmosphere 
must not exceed 10 percent.
    (v) Introduce the particles into the wind tunnel and allow the 
particle concentration to stabilize.
    (vi) Install an array of five or more evenly spaced isokinetic 
samplers in the sampling zone (see Sec. 53.42(d)) of the wind tunnel. 
Collect particles on appropriate filters (e.g., glass fiber) over a time 
period such that the relative error of the measured particle 
concentration is less than 5 percent. Relative error is defined as 
(px100%)/(X), where p is the precision of the fluorometer on the 
appropriate range, X is the measured concentration, and the units of p 
and X are the same.
    (vii) Determine the quantity of material collected with each 
isokinetic sampler in the array using a calibrated fluorometer. 
Calculate and record the mass concentration for each isokinetic sampler 
as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.015

where
i = replicate number and j = isokinetic sampler number.

    (viii) Calculate and record the mean mass concentration as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.016
    
where

n = total number of isokinetic samplers.

    (ix) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation of the mass 
concentration measurements as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.017


[[Page 72]]



If the value of CV<INF>iso(i)</INF> exceeds 0.10, the particle 
concentration uniformity is unacceptable and steps (vi) through (ix) 
must be repeated. If adjustment of the vibrating orifice aerosol 
generator or changes in the particle delivery system are necessary to 
achieve uniformity, steps (ii) through (ix) must be repeated. Remove the 
array of isokinetic samplers from the wind tunnel. NOTE: A single 
isokinetic sampler, operated at the same nominal flow rate as the test 
sampler, may be used in place of the array of isokinetic samplers for 
the determination of particle mass concentration used in the calculation 
of sampling effectiveness of the test sampler in step (xiii). In this 
case, the array of isokinetic samplers must be used to demonstrate 
particle concentration uniformity prior to the replicate measurements of 
sampling effectiveness.
    (x) If a single isokinetic sampler is used, install the sampler in 
the wind tunnel with the sampler nozzle centered in the sampling zone 
(see Sec. 53.42(d)). Collect particles on an appropriate filter (e.g., 
glass fiber) for a time period such that the relative error of the 
measured concentration (as defined in step (vi)) is less than 5 percent. 
Determine the quantity of material collected with the isokinetic sampler 
using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass 
concentration as C<INF>iso(i)</INF> as in step vii. Remove the 
isokinetic sampler from the wind tunnel.
    (xi) Install the test sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind 
tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone (see 
Sec. 53.42(d)). To meet the maximum blockage limit of Sec. 53.42(a) or 
for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to 
the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor 
the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles 
on an appropriate filter or filters (e.g., glass fiber) for a time 
period such that the relative error of the measured concentration (as 
defined in step (vi)) is less than 5 percent.
    (xii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the test 
sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass 
concentration as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.018

where i=replicate number.

    (xiii) Calculate and record the sampling effectiveness of the test 
sampler as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.019

where i = replicate number.

    Note: If a single isokinetic sampler is used for the determination 
of particle mass concentration, replace C<INF>iso(i)</INF> with 
C<INF>iso(i)</INF>.

    (xiv) Remove the test sampler from the wind tunnel. Repeat steps 
(vi) through (xiii), as appropriate, to obtain a minimum of three 
replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.
    (xv) Calculate and record the average sampling effectiveness of the 
test sampler as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.020

where n=number of replicates.
    (xvi) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation for the 
replicate sampling effectiveness measurements of the test sampler as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.021


[[Page 73]]



If the value of CV<INF>E</INF> exceeds 0.10, the test run (steps (ii) 
through (xvi)) must be repeated.
    (xvii) Repeat steps i through xvi for each wind speed, particle 
size, and particle type specified in table D-2.
    (xviii) For each of the three wind speeds (nominally 2, 8, and 24 
km/hr), correct the liquid particle sampling effectiveness data for the 
presence of multiplets (doublets and triplets) in the test particle 
atmospheres.
    (xix) For each wind speed, plot the corrected liquid particle 
sampling effectiveness of the test sampler (E<INF>corr</INF>) as a 
function of particle size (d<INF>p</INF>) on semi-logarithmic graph 
paper where d<INF>p</INF> is the particle size established by the 
operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. 
Construct a smooth curve through the data.
    (xx) For each wind speed, calculate the expected mass concentration 
for the test sampler under the assumed particle size distribution and 
compare it to the mass concentration predicted for the ideal sampler, as 
follows:
    (A) Extrapolate the upper and lower ends of the corrected liquid 
particle sampling effectiveness curve to 100 percent and 0 percent, 
respectively, using smooth curves. Assume that E<INF>corr</INF> = 100 
percent at a particle size of 1.0 [micro]m and E<INF>corr</INF> = 0 
percent at a particle size of 50 [micro]m.
    (B) Determine the value of E<INF>corr</INF> at each of the particle 
sizes specified in the first column of table D-3. Record each 
E<INF>corr</INF> value as a decimal between 0 and 1 in the second column 
of table D-3.
    (C) Multiply the values of E<INF>corr</INF> in column 2 by the 
interval mass concentration values in column 3 and enter the products in 
column 4 of table D-3.
    (D) Sum the values in column 4 and enter the total as the expected 
mass concentration for the test sampler at the bottom of column 4 of 
table D-3.
    (E) Calculate and record the percent difference in expected mass 
concentration between the test sampler and the ideal sampler as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.022

where:

C<INF>sam(exp)</INF> = expected mass concentration for the test sampler, 
[micro]g/m\3\
C<INF>ideal(exp)</INF> = expected mass concentration for the ideal 
sampler, [micro]g/m\3\ (calculated for the ideal sampler and given at 
the bottom of column 7 of table D-3.)

    (F) The candidate method passes the liquid particle sampling 
effectiveness test if the [Delta] C value for each wind speed meets the 
specification in table D-1.
    (xxi) For each of the two wind speeds (nominally 8 and 24 km/hr), 
calculate the difference between the average sampling effectiveness 
value for the 25 [micro]m solid particles and the average sampling 
effectiveness value for the 25 [micro]m liquid particles (uncorrected 
for multiplets).
    (xxii) The candidate method passes the solid particle sampling 
effectiveness test if each such difference meets the specification in 
table D-1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) 50 Percent cutpoint--(1) Technical definition. The particle size 
for which the sampling effectiveness of the sampler is 50 percent.
    (2) Test procedure. (i) From the corrected liquid particle sampling 
effectiveness curves for each of the three wind speeds, determine the 
particle size at which the curve crosses the 50 percent effectiveness 
line and record as D<INF>50</INF> on the corresponding sampling 
effectiveness plot.
    (ii) The candidate method passes the 50 percent cutpoint test if the 
D<INF>50</INF> value at each wind speed meets the specification in table 
D-1.
    (c) Precision--(1) Technical definition. The variation in the 
measured particle concentration among identical samplers under typical 
sampling conditions.
    (2) Test procedure. (i) Set up three identical test samplers at the 
test site in strict accordance with the instructions in the manual 
referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3). Locate the test sampler inlet openings 
at the same height and between 2 and 4 meters apart. The samplers shall 
be oriented in a manner that will minimize spatial and wind directional 
effects on sample collection. Perform a flow calibration for each test 
sampler in accordance with the instructions given in the instruction 
manual and/or appendix J to part 50 of this chapter. Set the operating 
flow rate to the value prescribed in the sampler instruction manual.

    Note: For candidate equivalent methods, this test may be used to 
satisfy part of the requirements of subpart C of this chapter. In that 
case, three reference method samplers are also used at the test site, 
measurements with the candidate and reference methods are compared as 
specified in Sec. 53.34, and the test site must meet the requirements 
of Sec. 53.30(b).

    (ii) Measure the PM<INF>10</INF> concentration of the atmosphere 
using the three test samplers for 10 periods (test days) of 24 hours 
each. On each of the 10 test days, measure the initial and final flow 
rates of each test sampler. On three of the test days, measure the flow 
rate of each test sampler after 6, 12, and 18 hours of operation. All 
measurements of flow rate and mass collected must be

[[Page 75]]

made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the sampler 
instruction manual and/or appendix J to part 50 of this chapter. All 
measurements of flow rate must be in actual volumetric units. Record the 
PM<INF>10</INF> concentration for each sampler and each test day as 
C<INF>(i)(j)</INF> where i is the sampler number and j is the test day.
    (iii) For each test day, calculate and record the average of the 
three measured PM<INF>10</INF> concentrations as C<INF>(j)</INF> where j 
is the test day. If C<INF>(j)</INF><30 [micro]g/m\3\ for any test day, 
data from that test day are unacceptable and the tests for that day must 
be repeated.
    (iv) Calculate and record the precision for each of the 10 test days 
as:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    (v) The candidate method passes the precision test if all 10 
P<INF>j</INF> or RP<INF>j</INF> values meet the specifications in table 
D-1.
    (d) Flow rate stability--(1) Technical definition. Freedom from 
variation in the operating flow rate of the sampler under typical 
sampling conditions.
    (2) Test procedure. (i) For each of the three test samplers and each 
of the 10 test days of the precision test, record each measured flow 
rate as F<INF>(i)(j)(t)</INF>, where i is the sampler number, j is the 
test day, and t is the time of flow rate measurement (t=0, 6, 12, 18, or 
24 hours).
    (ii) For each sampler and for each test day, calculate and record 
the average flow rate as:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

where n = number of flow rate measurements during the 24-hour test day.

    (iii) For each sampler and for each test day, calculate and record 
the percent difference between the average flow rate and the initial 
flow rate as:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

where F<INF>(i)(j)(0)</INF> is the initial flow rate (t=0).

    (iv) For each sampler and for each of the 3 test days on which flow 
measurements were obtained at 6-hour intervals throughout the 24-hour 
sampling period, calculate and record the percent differences between 
each measured flow rate and the initial flow rate as:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

where t = 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours.

    (v) The candidate method passes the flow rate stability test if all 
of the [Delta] F<INF>(i)(j)</INF> and [Delta] F<INF>(i)(j)(t)</INF> 
values meet the specifications in table D-1.

    (i) The PM<INF>2.5</INF> sampler of the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> sampler 
pair shall be verified to be either currently designated under this part 
53 as a FRM for PM<INF>2.5</INF>, or shown to meet all requirements for 
designation as a FRM for PM<INF>2.5</INF>, in accordance with this part 
53.
    (ii) The PM<INF>10C</INF> sampler of the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> sampler 
pair shall be verified to be of like manufacturer, design, 
configuration, and fabrication to the PM<INF>2.5</INF> sampler of the 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> sampler pair, except for replacement of the particle 
size separator specified in section 7.3.4 of appendix L to part 50 of 
this chapter with the downtube extension as specified in Figure O-1 of 
appendix O to part 50 of this chapter.
    (iii) For samplers that meet the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(i)

[[Page 77]]

    (3) Class II method. A sampler associated with a Class II candidate 
equivalent method for PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> shall be subject to the 
applicable requirements of this subpart E, as described in Sec. 
53.3(a)(5).
    (d) The provisions of Sec. 53.51 pertain to test results and 
documentation required to demonstrate compliance of a candidate method 
sampler with the design specifications set forth in 40 CFR part 50, 
appendix L or O, as applicable. The test procedures prescribed in 
Sec. Sec. 53.52 through 53.59 pertain to performance tests required to 
demonstrate compliance of a candidate method sampler with the 
performance specifications set forth in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or O,

and requirements specified in each procedure and summarized in table E-1 
of this subpart.
    (e) Test procedures prescribed in Sec. 53.59 do not apply to 
candidate reference method samplers. These procedures apply primarily to 
candidate Class I or Class II equivalent method samplers for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> that have a sample air flow path 
configuration upstream of the sample filter that is modified from that 
specified for the FRM sampler, as set forth in 40 CFR part 50, appendix 
L, Figures L-1 to L-29 or 40 CFR part 50 appendix O, Figure O-1, if 
applicable, such as might be necessary to provide for sequential sample 
capability. The additional tests determine the adequacy of aerosol 
transport through any altered components or supplemental devices that 
are used in a candidate sampler upstream of the filter. In addition to 
the other test procedures in this subpart, these test procedures shall 
be used to further test the performance of such an equivalent method 
sampler against the performance specifications given in the procedure 
and summarized in table E-1 of this subpart.
    (f) A 10-day operational field test of measurement precision is 
required under Sec. 53.58 for both FRM and Class I FEM samplers for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>. This test requires collocated operation of three 
candidate method samplers at a field test site. For candidate FEM 
samplers, this test may be combined and carried out concurrently with 
the test for comparability to the FRM specified under Sec. 53.34, which 
requires collocated operation of three FRM samplers and three candidate 
FEM samplers.
    (g) All tests and collection of test data shall be performed in 
accordance with the requirements of reference 1, section 4.10.5 (ISO 
9001) and reference 2, part B, (section 6) and Part C, (section 7) in 
appendix A of this subpart. All test data and other documentation 
obtained specifically from or pertinent to these tests shall be 
identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and 
submitted to EPA in accordance with subpart A of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 53.51  Demonstration of compliance with design specifications and 

manufacturing and test requirements.

    (a) Overview. (1) Paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section specify 
certain documentation that must be submitted and tests that are required 
to demonstrate that samplers associated with a designated FRM or FEM for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> are properly manufactured to 
meet all applicable design and performance specifications and have been 
properly tested according to all applicable test requirements for such 
designation. Documentation is required to show that instruments and 
components of a PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> sampler are 
manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility under a quality system 
that meets ISO-9001 requirements for manufacturing quality control and 
testing.
    (2) In addition, specific tests are required by paragraph (d) of 
this section to verify that critical features of FRM samplers--the 
particle size separator and the surface finish of surfaces specified to 
be anodized--meet the specifications of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or 
appendix O, as applicable. A checklist is required to provide 
certification by an ISO-certified auditor that all performance and other 
required tests have been properly and appropriately conducted, based on 
a reasonable and appropriate sample of the actual operations or their 
documented records. Following designation of the method,

[[Page 78]]

another checklist is required initially to provide an ISO-certified 
auditor's certification that the sampler manufacturing process is being 
implemented under an adequate and appropriate quality system.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the definitions of ISO 9001-
registered facility and ISO-certified auditor are found in Sec. 53.1. 
An exception to the reliance by EPA on ISO-certified auditors is the 
requirement for the submission of the operation or instruction manual 
associated with the candidate method to EPA as part of the application. 
This manual is required under Sec. 53.4(b)(3). The EPA has determined 
that acceptable technical judgment for review of this manual may not be 
assured by ISO-certified auditors, and approval of this manual will 
therefore be performed by EPA.
    (b) ISO registration of manufacturing facility. The applicant must 
submit documentation verifying that the samplers identified and sold as 
part of a designated PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> FRM or FEM 
will be manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility and that the 
manufacturing facility is maintained in compliance with all applicable 
ISO 9001 requirements (reference 1 in appendix A of this subpart). The 
documentation shall indicate the date of the original ISO 9001 
registration for the facility and shall include a copy of the most 
recent certification of continued ISO 9001 facility registration. If the 
manufacturer does not wish to initiate or complete ISO 9001 registration 
for the manufacturing facility, documentation must be included in the 
application to EPA describing an alternative method to demonstrate that 
the facility meets the same general requirements as required for 
registration to ISO-9001. In this case, the applicant must provide 
documentation in the application to demonstrate, by required ISO-
certified auditor's inspections, that a quality system is in place which 
is adequate to document and monitor that the sampler system components 
and final assembled samplers all conform to the design, performance and 
other requirements specified in this part and in 40 CFR part 50, 
appendix L.
    (c) Sampler manufacturing quality control. The manufacturer must 
ensure that all components used in the manufacture of PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> samplers to be sold as part of a FRM or FEM and 
that are specified by design in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or O (as 
applicable), are fabricated or manufactured exactly as specified. If the 
manufacturer's quality records show that its quality control (QC) and 
quality assurance (QA) system of standard process control inspections 
(of a set number and frequency of testing that is less than 100 percent) 
complies with the applicable QA provisions of section 4 of reference 4 
in appendix A of this subpart and prevents nonconformances, 100 percent 
testing shall not be required until that conclusion is disproved by 
customer return or other independent manufacturer or customer test 
records. If problems are uncovered, inspection to verify conformance to 
the drawings, specifications, and tolerances shall be performed. Refer 
also to paragraph (e) of this section--final assembly and inspection 
requirements.
    (d) Specific tests and supporting documentation required to verify 
conformance to critical component specifications-- (1) Verification of 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> (WINS) impactor jet diameter. For samplers utilizing 
the WINS impactor particle size separator specified in paragraphs 
7.3.4.1, 7.3.4.2, and 7.3.4.3 of appendix L to part 50 of this chapter, 
the diameter of the jet of each impactor manufactured for a 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> sampler under the impactor 
design specifications set forth in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, shall be 
verified against the tolerance specified on the drawing, using standard, 
NIST-traceable ZZ go/no go plug gages. This test shall be a final check 
of the jet diameter following all fabrication operations, and a record 
shall be kept of this final check. The manufacturer shall submit 
evidence that this procedure is incorporated into the manufacturing 
procedure, that the test is or will be routinely implemented, and that 
an appropriate procedure is in place for the disposition of units that 
fail this tolerance test.
    (2) VSCC separator. For samplers utilizing the BGI VSCC<SUP>TM</SUP> 
Very Sharp Cut Cyclone particle size separator specified in paragraph 
7.3.4.4 of appendix L to part 50 of this chapter, the VSCC

[[Page 79]]

manufacturer shall identify the critical dimensions and manufacturing 
tolerances for the device, develop appropriate test procedures to verify 
that the critical dimensions and tolerances are maintained during the 
manufacturing process, and carry out those procedures on each VSCC 
manufactured to verify conformance of the manufactured products. The 
manufacturer shall also maintain records of these tests and their 
results and submit evidence that this procedure is incorporated into the 
manufacturing procedure, that the test is or will be routinely 
implemented, and that an appropriate procedure is in place for the 
disposition of units that fail this tolerance test.
    (3) Verification of surface finish. The anodization process used to 
treat surfaces specified to be anodized shall be verified by testing 
treated specimen surfaces for weight and corrosion resistance to ensure 
that the coating obtained conforms to the coating specification. The 
specimen surfaces shall be finished in accordance with military standard 
specification 8625F, Type II, Class I (reference 4 in appendix A of this 
subpart) in the same way the sampler surfaces are finished, and tested, 
prior to sealing, as specified in section 4.5.2 of reference 4 in 
appendix A of this subpart.
    (e) Final assembly and inspection requirements. Each sampler shall 
be tested after manufacture and before delivery to the final user. Each 
manufacturer shall document its post-manufacturing test procedures. As a 
minimum, each test shall consist of the following: Tests of the overall 
integrity of the sampler, including leak tests; calibration or 
verification of the calibration of the flow measurement device, 
barometric pressure sensor, and temperature sensors; and operation of 
the sampler with a filter in place over a period of at least 48 hours. 
The results of each test shall be suitably documented and shall be 
subject to review by an ISO-certified auditor.
    (f) Manufacturer's audit checklists. Manufacturers shall require an 
ISO-certified auditor to sign and date a statement indicating that the 
auditor is aware of the appropriate manufacturing specifications 
contained in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or O (as applicable), and the 
test or verification requirements in this subpart. Manufacturers shall 
also require an ISO-certified auditor to complete the checklists, shown 
in figures E-1 and E-2 of this subpart, which describe the 
manufacturer's ability to meet the requirements of the standard for both 
designation testing and product manufacture.
    (1) Designation testing checklist. The completed statement and 
checklist as shown in figure E-1 of this subpart shall be submitted with 
the application for FRM or FEM determination.
    (2) Product manufacturing checklist. Manufacturers shall require an 
ISO-certified auditor to complete a Product Manufacturing Checklist 
(figure E-2 of this subpart), which evaluates the manufacturer on its 
ability to meet the requirements of the standard in maintaining quality 
control in the production of FRM or FEM devices. The completed checklist 
shall be submitted with the application for FRM or FEM determination.

Sec. 53.52  Leak check test.

    (a) Overview. In section 7.4.6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, the 
sampler is required to include the facility, including components, 
instruments, operator controls, a written procedure, and other 
capabilities as necessary, to allow the operator to carry out a leak 
test of the sampler at a field monitoring site without additional 
equipment. This test procedure is intended to test the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the sampler's leak check facility. Because of the 
variety of potential sampler configurations and leak check procedures 
possible, some adaptation of this procedure may be necessary to 
accommodate the specific sampler under test. The test conditions and 
performance specifications associated with this test are summarized in 
table E-1 of this subpart. The candidate test sampler must meet all test 
parameters and test specifications to successfully pass this test.
    (b) Technical definitions. (1) External leakage includes the total 
flow rate of external ambient air which enters the sampler other than 
through the sampler inlet and which passes through

[[Page 80]]

any one or more of the impactor, filter, or flow rate measurement 
components.
    (2) Internal leakage is the total sample air flow rate that passes 
through the filter holder assembly without passing through the sample 
filter.
    (c) Required test equipment. (1) Flow rate measurement device, range 
70 mL/min to 130 mL/min, 2 percent certified accuracy, NIST-traceable.
    (2) Flow rate measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, 
figure L-30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler 
flow rate at the top of the downtube.
    (3) Impermeable membrane or disk, 47 mm nominal diameter.
    (4) Means, such as a micro-valve, of providing a simulated leak flow 
rate through the sampler of approximately 80 mL/min under the conditions 
specified for the leak check in the sampler's leak check procedure.
    (5) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 
50, appendix L.
    (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit 
documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, 
certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if 
required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy 
of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest 
pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at 
zero and one or more non-zero flow rates within 7 days of use for this 
test.
    (e) Test setup. (1) The test sampler shall be set up for testing as 
described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to 
in Sec. 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up 
in its normal configuration for collecting PM samples, except that the 
sample air inlet shall be removed and the flow rate measurement adaptor 
shall be installed on the sampler's downtube.
    (2) The flow rate control device shall be set up to provide a 
constant, controlled flow rate of 80 mL/min into the sampler downtube 
under the conditions specified for the leak check in the sampler's leak 
check procedure.
    (3) The flow rate measurement device shall be set up to measure the 
controlled flow rate of 80 mL/min into the sampler downtube under the 
conditions specified for the leak check in the sampler's leak check 
procedure.
    (f) Procedure. (1) Install the impermeable membrane in a filter 
cassette and install the cassette into the sampler. Carry out the 
internal leak check procedure as described in the sampler's operation/
instruction manual and verify that the leak check acceptance criterion 
specified in table E-1 of this subpart is met.
    (2) Replace the impermeable membrane with a Teflon filter and 
install the cassette in the sampler. Remove the inlet from the sampler 
and install the flow measurement adaptor on the sampler's downtube. 
Close the valve of the adaptor to seal the flow system. Conduct the 
external leak check procedure as described in the sampler's operation/
instruction manual and verify that the leak check acceptance criteria 
specified in table E-1 of this subpart are met.
    (3) Arrange the flow control device, flow rate measurement device, 
and other apparatus as necessary to provide a simulated leak flow rate 
of 80 mL/min into the test sampler through the downtube during the 
specified external leak check procedure. Carry out the external leak 
check procedure as described in the sampler's operation/instruction 
manual but with the simulated leak of 80 mL/min.
    (g) Test results. The requirements for successful passage of this 
test are:
    (1) That the leak check procedure indicates no significant external 
or internal leaks in the test sampler when no simulated leaks are 
introduced.
    (2) That the leak check procedure properly identifies the occurrence 
of the simulated external leak of 80 mL/min.

Sec. 53.53  Test for flow rate accuracy, regulation, measurement accuracy, 

and cut-off.

    (a) Overview. This test procedure is designed to evaluate a 
candidate sampler's flow rate accuracy with respect to the design flow 
rate, flow rate regulation, flow rate measurement accuracy, coefficient 
of variability measurement accuracy, and the flow rate

[[Page 81]]

cut-off function. The tests for the first four parameters shall be 
conducted over a 6-hour time period during which reference flow 
measurements are made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. The flow 
rate cut-off test, conducted separately, is intended to verify that the 
sampler carries out the required automatic sample flow rate cut-off 
function properly in the event of a low-flow condition. The test 
conditions and performance specifications associated with this test are 
summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. The candidate test sampler must 
meet all test parameters and test specifications to successfully pass 
this test.
    (b) Technical definitions. (1) Sample flow rate means the 
quantitative volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the 
sampler to enter the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, 
measured in actual volume units at the temperature and pressure of the 
air as it enters the inlet.
    (2) The flow rate cut-off function requires the sampler to 
automatically stop sample flow and terminate the current sample 
collection if the sample flow rate deviates by more than the variation 
limits specified in table E-1 of this subpart (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 
percent from the nominal sample flow rate) for more than 60 seconds 
during a sample collection period. The sampler is also required to 
properly notify the operator with a flag warning indication of the out-
of-specification flow rate condition and if the flow rate cut-off 
results in an elapsed sample collection time of less than 23 hours.
    (c) Required test equipment. (1) Flow rate meter, suitable for 
measuring and recording the actual volumetric sample flow rate at the 
sampler downtube, with a minimum range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent 
certified, NIST-traceable accuracy. Optional capability for continuous 
(analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to 
exceed 30 seconds is recommended. While a flow meter which provides a 
direct indication of volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an 
alternative certified flow measurement device may be used as long as 
appropriate volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on 
measurements of actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.
    (2) Ambient air temperature sensor, with a resolution of 0.1 [deg]C 
and certified to be accurate to within 0.5 [deg]C (if needed). If the 
certified flow meter does not provide direct volumetric flow rate 
readings, ambient air temperature measurements must be made using 
continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at 
intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
    (3) Barometer, range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2 
mm Hg (if needed). If the certified flow meter does not provide direct 
volumetric flow rate readings, ambient pressure measurements must be 
made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording 
at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
    (4) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-
30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sample flow rate 
at the sampler downtube.
    (5) Valve or other means to restrict or reduce the sample flow rate 
to a value at least 10 percent below the design flow rate (16.67 L/min). 
If appropriate, the valve of the flow measurement adaptor may be used 
for this purpose.
    (6) Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in 
the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or 
flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or 
other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the 
filter.
    (7) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 
50, appendix L (if required).
    (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit 
documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, 
certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if 
required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy 
of flow-rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest 
pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at 
zero and at least one flow rate within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent 
of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an 
instrument's measurements are to be recorded with

[[Page 82]]

an analog recording device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-
recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.
    (e) Test setup. (1) Setup of the sampler shall be as required in 
this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the sampler's operation 
or instruction manual referred to in Sec. 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall 
be installed upright and set up in its normal configuration for 
collecting PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating 
an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration 
of these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and 
flow rate measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's 
operation or instruction manual within 7 days prior to this test.
    (2) The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow 
measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as 
described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be 
conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried 
out.
    (3) The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to 
the outlet of the flow rate meter.
    (4) For the flow rate cut-off test, the valve or means for reducing 
sampler flow rate shall be installed between the flow measurement 
adaptor and the downtube or in another location within the sampler such 
that the sampler flow rate can be manually restricted during the test.
    (f) Procedure. (1) Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e) 
of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample 
collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or 
instruction manual. Set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour 
sample collection period at a convenient time.
    (2) During the 6-hour operational flow rate portion of the test, 
measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter at 
intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and pressure 
corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, ambient 
temperature and pressure shall be measured at the same frequency as that 
of the certified flow rate measurements. Note and record the actual 
start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.
    (3) Following completion of the 6-hour flow rate test period, 
install the flow rate reduction device and change the sampler flow rate 
recording frequency to intervals of not more than 30 seconds. Reset the 
sampler to start a new sample collection period. Manually restrict the 
sampler flow rate such that the sampler flow rate is decreased slowly 
over several minutes to a flow rate slightly less than the flow rate 
cut-off value (15.0 L/min). Maintain this flow rate for at least 2.0 
minutes or until the sampler stops the sample flow automatically. 
Manually terminate the sample period, if the sampler has not terminated 
it automatically.
    (g) Test results. At the completion of the test, validate the test 
conditions and determine the test results as follows:
    (1) Mean sample flow rate. (i) From the certified measurements 
(Q<INF>ref</INF>) of the test sampler flow rate obtained by use of the 
flow rate meter, tabulate each flow rate measurement in units of L/min. 
If ambient temperature and pressure corrections are necessary to 
calculate volumetric flow rate, each measured flow rate shall be 
corrected using its corresponding temperature and pressure measurement 
values. Calculate the mean flow rate for the sample period 
(Q<INF>ref,ave</INF>) as follows:
                               Equation 1

value and the design value of 16.67 L/min, as follows:
                               Equation 2
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.064


[[Page 83]]


    (B) To successfully pass the mean flow rate test, the percent 
difference calculated in Equation 2 of this paragraph (g)(1)(ii) must be 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent.
    (2) Sample flow rate regulation. (i) From the certified measurements 
of the test sampler flow rate, calculate the sample coefficient of 
variation (CV) of the discrete measurements as follows:
                               Equation 3
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.065

    (ii) To successfully pass the flow rate regulation test, the 
calculated coefficient of variation for the certified flow rates must 
not exceed 2 percent.

the 6-hour test period (Q<INF>ind,ave</INF>), determine the accuracy of 
the reported mean flow rate as:
                               Equation 4
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.066

    (ii) To successfully pass the flow rate measurement accuracy test, 
the percent difference calculated in Equation 4 of this paragraph (g)(3) 
shall not exceed 2 percent.
    (4) Flow rate coefficient of variation measurement accuracy. (i) 
Using the flow rate coefficient of variation indicated by the candidate 
test sampler at the completion of the 6-hour test (%CV<INF>ind</INF>), 
determine the accuracy of this reported coefficient of variation as:
                               Equation 5
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.067

    (ii) To successfully pass the flow rate CV measurement accuracy 
test, the absolute difference in values calculated in Equation 5 of this 
paragraph (g)(4) must not exceed 0.3 (CV%).
    (5) Flow rate cut-off. (i) Inspect the measurements of the sample 
flow rate during the flow rate cut-off test and determine the time at 
which the sample flow rate decreased to a value less than the cut-off 
value specified in table E-1 of this subpart. To pass this test, the 
sampler must have automatically stopped the sample flow at least 30 
seconds but not more than 90 seconds after the time at which the sampler 
flow rate was determined to have decreased to a value less than the cut-
off value.
    (ii) At the completion of the flow rate cut-off test, download the 
archived data from the test sampler and verify that the sampler's 
required Flow-out-of-spec and Incorrect sample period flag indicators 
are properly set.

Sec. 53.55  Test for effect of variations in power line voltage and ambient 

temperature.

    (a) Overview. (1) This test procedure is a combined procedure to

30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate 
at the sampler downtube.

sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in Sec. 
53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in the 
temperature-controlled chamber in its normal configuration for 
collecting PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating

following conditions of chamber temperature and electrical power line 
voltage (respectively):

temperature and power line voltage for the test run. Upon achieving each 
temperature setpoint in the chamber, the candidate sampler and flow 
meter shall be thermally equilibrated for a period of at least 2 hours

at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and 
pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, 
ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at

[[Page 88]]

the same frequency as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note 
and record the actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test 
period.

Sec. 53.56  Test for effect of variations in ambient pressure.

    (a) Overview. (1) This test procedure is designed to test various 
sampler performance parameters under variations in ambient (barometric) 
pressure. Tests shall be conducted in a pressure-controlled environment 
over two 6-hour time periods during which reference pressure and flow 
rate measurements shall be made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. 
Specific parameters to be evaluated at operating pressures of 600 and 
800 mm Hg are as follows:
    (i) Sample flow rate.
    (ii) Flow rate regulation.
    (iii) Flow rate measurement accuracy.
    (iv) Coefficient of variability measurement accuracy.
    (v) Ambient pressure measurement accuracy.
    (vi) Proper operation of the sampler when exposed to ambient 
pressure extremes.
    (2) The performance parameters tested under this procedure, the 
corresponding minimum performance specifications, and the applicable 
test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. Each 
performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test 
procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification 
given. The candidate sampler must meet all specifications for the 
associated PM<INF>2.5</INF> or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> method (as 
applicable) to pass this test procedure.
    (b) Technical definition. Sample flow rate means the quantitative 
volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter 
the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, measured in actual 
volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the 
inlet.
    (c) Required test equipment. (1) Hypobaric chamber or other 
pressure-controlled environment or environments, capable of obtaining 
and maintaining pressures at 600 mm Hg and 800 mm Hg required for the 
test with an accuracy of 5 mm Hg. Henceforth, where the test procedures 
specify a test or environmental chamber, an alternative pressure-
controlled environmental area or areas may be substituted, provided the 
test pressure requirements are met. Means for simulating ambient 
pressure using a closed-loop sample air system may also be approved for 
this test; such a proposed method for simulating the test pressure 
conditions may be described and submitted to EPA at the address given in 
Sec. 53.4(a) prior to conducting the test for a specific individual 
determination of acceptability.
    (2) Flow rate meter, suitable for measuring and recording the actual 
volumetric sampler flow rate at the sampler downtube, with a minimum 
range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent certified, NIST-traceable accuracy. 
Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording capability or 
digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes is recommended. 
While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of volumetric flow 
rate is preferred for this test, an alternative certified flow 
measurement device may be used as long as appropriate volumetric

[[Page 90]]

flow rate corrections are made based on measurements of actual ambient 
temperature and pressure conditions.
    (3) Ambient air temperature recorder (if needed for volumetric 
corrections to flow rate measurements) with a range -30 [deg]C to =50 
[deg]C, certified accurate to within 0.5 [deg]C. If the certified flow 
meter does not provide direct volumetric flow rate readings, ambient 
temperature measurements must be made using continuous (analog) 
recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 
minutes.
    (4) Barometer, range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2 
mm Hg. Ambient air pressure measurements must be made using continuous 
(analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to 
exceed 5 minutes.
    (5) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-
30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate 
at the sampler downtube.
    (6) Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in 
the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or 
flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or 
other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the 
filter.
    (7) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 
50, appendix L (if required).
    (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit 
documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, 
certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if 
required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy 
of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest 
pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at 
zero and at least one flow rate within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent 
of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an 
instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording 
device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be 
calibrated or verified.
    (e) Test setup. (1) Setup of the sampler shall be performed as 
required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the 
sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in Sec. 
53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in the 
pressure-controlled chamber in its normal configuration for collecting 
PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating an 
additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration of 
these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and 
flow measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's 
operating manual within 7 days prior to this test.
    (2) The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow 
measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as 
described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be 
conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried 
out.
    (3) The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to 
the outlet of the flow rate meter.
    (4) The barometer shall be installed in the test chamber such that 
it will accurately measure the air pressure to which the candidate 
sampler is subjected.
    (f) Procedure. (1) Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e) 
of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample 
collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or 
instruction manual.
    (2) The test shall consist of two test runs, one at each of the 
following conditions of chamber pressure:
    (i) 600 mm Hg.
    (ii) 800 mm Hg.
    (3) For each of the two test runs, set the selected chamber pressure 
for the test run. Upon achieving each pressure setpoint in the chamber, 
the candidate sampler shall be pressure-equilibrated for a period of at 
least 30 minutes prior to the test run. Following the conditioning time, 
set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour sample collection period 
at a convenient time.
    (4) During each 6-hour test period:
    (i) Measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter 
at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and 
pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, 
ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at

[[Page 91]]

the same frequency as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note 
and record the actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test 
period.
    (ii) Determine and record the ambient (chamber) pressure indicated 
by the sampler and the corresponding ambient (chamber) pressure measured 
by the barometer specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section at 
intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
    (5) At the end of each test period, terminate the sample period (if 
not automatically terminated by the sampler) and download all archived 
instrument data for the test run from the test sampler.
    (g) Test results. For each of the two test runs, examine the chamber 
pressure measurements. Verify that the pressure met the requirements 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section at all times during the test. 
If not, the test run is not valid and must be repeated. Determine the 
test results as follows:
    (1) Mean sample flow rate. (i) From the certified measurements 
(Q<INF>ref</INF>) of the test sampler flow rate, tabulate each flow rate 
measurement in units of L/min. If ambient temperature and pressure

temperature and pressure measurement values. Calculate the mean flow 
rate for the sample period (Q<INF>ref,ave</INF>) as follows:
                               Equation 17

Sec. 53.57  Test for filter temperature control during sampling and post-

sampling periods.

    (a) Overview. This test is intended to measure the candidate 
sampler's ability to prevent excessive overheating of the PM sample 
collection filter (or filters) under conditions of elevated solar 
insolation. The test evaluates radiative effects on filter temperature 
during a 4-hour period of active sampling as well as during a subsequent 
4-hour non-sampling time period prior to filter retrieval. Tests shall 
be conducted in an environmental chamber which provides the proper 
radiant wavelengths and energies to adequately simulate the sun's 
radiant effects under clear conditions at sea level. For additional 
guidance on conducting solar radiative tests under controlled 
conditions, consult military standard specification 810-E (reference 6 
in appendix A of this subpart). The performance parameters tested under 
this procedure, the corresponding minimum performance specifications, 
and the applicable test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this 
subpart. Each performance parameter tested, as described or determined 
in the test procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance 
specification to successfully pass this test.
    (b) Technical definition. Filter temperature control during sampling 
is the ability of a sampler to maintain the temperature of the 
particulate matter sample filter within the specified deviation (5 
[deg]C) from ambient temperature during any active sampling period. 
Post-sampling temperature control is the ability of a sampler to 
maintain the temperature of the particulate matter sample filter within 
the specified deviation from ambient temperature during the period from 
the end of active sample collection by the sampler until the filter is 
retrieved from the sampler for laboratory analysis.
    (c) Required test equipment. (1) Environmental chamber providing the 
means, such as a bank of solar-spectrum lamps, for generating or 
simulating thermal radiation in approximate spectral content and 
intensity equivalent to solar insulation of 1000 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>50 W/m\2\ inside the environmental chamber. To properly 
simulate the sun's radiative effects on the sampler, the solar bank must 
provide the spectral energy distribution and permitted tolerances 
specified in table E-2 of this subpart. The solar radiation source area 
shall be such that the width of the candidate sampler shall not exceed 
one-half the dimensions of the solar bank. The solar bank shall be 
located a minimum of 76 cm (30 inches) from any surface of the candidate 
sampler. To meet requirements of the solar radiation tests, the 
chamber's internal volume shall be a minimum of 10 times that of the 
volume of the candidate sampler. Air velocity in the region of the 
sampler must be maintained continuously during the radiative tests at 
2.0 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 m/sec.
    (2) Ambient air temperature recorder, range -30 [deg]C to =50 
[deg]C, with a resolution of 0.1 [deg]C and certified accurate to within 
0.5 [deg]C. Ambient air temperature measurements must be made using 
continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at 
intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.

[[Page 93]]

    (3) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-
30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate 
at the sampler downtube.
    (4) Miniature temperature sensor(s), capable of being installed in 
the sampler without introducing air leakage and capable of measuring the 
sample air temperature within 1 cm of the center of the filter, 
downstream of the filter; with a resolution of 0.1 [deg]C, certified 
accurate to within 0.5 [deg]C, NIST-traceable, with continuous (analog) 
recording capability or digital recording at intervals of not more than 
5 minutes.
    (5) Solar radiometer, to measure the intensity of the simulated 
solar radiation in the test environment, range of 0 to approximately 
1500 W/m\2\. Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording or 
digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes is recommended.
    (6) Sample filter or filters, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR 
part 50, appendix L.
    (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit 
documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, 
certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if 
required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy 
of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest 
pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at 
zero and at least one flow rate within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent 
of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an 
instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording 
device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be 
calibrated or verified.
    (e) Test setup. (1) Setup of the sampler shall be performed as 
required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the 
sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in Sec. 
53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in the 
solar radiation environmental chamber in its normal configuration for 
collecting PM samples (with the inlet installed). The sampler's ambient 
and filter temperature measurement systems shall be calibrated per the 
sampler's operating manual within 7 days prior to this test. A sample 
filter shall be installed for the duration of this test. For sequential 
samplers, a sample filter shall also be installed in each available 
sequential channel or station intended for collection of a sequential 
sample (or at least five additional filters for magazine-type sequential 
samplers) as directed by the sampler's operation or instruction manual.
    (2) The miniature temperature sensor shall be temporarily installed 
in the test sampler such that it accurately measures the air temperature 
1 cm from the center of the filter on the downstream side of the filter. 
The sensor shall be installed such that no external or internal air 
leakage is created by the sensor installation. The sensor's dimensions 
and installation shall be selected to minimize temperature measurement 
uncertainties due to thermal conduction along the sensor mounting 
structure or sensor conductors. For sequential samplers, similar 
temperature sensors shall also be temporarily installed in the test 
sampler to monitor the temperature 1 cm from the center of each filter 
stored in the sampler for sequential sample operation.
    (3) The solar radiant energy source shall be installed in the test 
chamber such that the entire test sampler is irradiated in a manner 
similar to the way it would be irradiated by solar radiation if it were 
located outdoors in an open area on a sunny day, with the radiation 
arriving at an angle of between 30[deg] and 45[deg] from vertical. The 
intensity of the radiation received by all sampler surfaces that receive 
direct radiation shall average 1000 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>50 W/m\2\, 
measured in a plane perpendicular to the incident radiation. The 
incident radiation shall be oriented with respect to the sampler such 
that the area of the sampler's ambient temperature sensor (or 
temperature shield) receives full, direct radiation as it would or could 
during normal outdoor installation. Also, the temperature sensor must 
not be shielded or shaded from the radiation by a sampler part in a way 
that would not occur at other normal insulation angles or directions.
    (4) The solar radiometer shall be installed in a location where it 
measures thermal radiation that is generally

[[Page 94]]

representative of the average thermal radiation intensity that the upper 
portion of the sampler and sampler inlet receive. The solar radiometer 
shall be oriented so that it measures the radiation in a plane 
perpendicular to its angle of incidence.
    (5) The ambient air temperature recorder shall be installed in the 
test chamber such that it will accurately measure the temperature of the 
air in the chamber without being unduly affected by the chamber's air 
temperature control system or by the radiant energy from the solar 
radiation source that may be present inside the test chamber.
    (f) Procedure. (1) Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e) 
of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample 
collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or 
instruction manual.
    (2) Remove the inlet of the candidate test sampler and install the 
flow measurement adaptor on the sampler's downtube. Conduct a leak check 
as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual. The leak 
test must be properly passed before other tests are carried out.
    (3) Remove the flow measurement adaptor from the downtube and re-
install the sampling inlet.
    (4) Activate the solar radiation source and verify that the 
resulting energy distribution prescribed in table E-2 of this subpart is 
achieved.
    (5) Program the test sampler to conduct a single sampling run of 4 
continuous hours. During the 4-hour sampling run, measure and record the 
radiant flux, ambient temperature, and filter temperature (all filter 
temperatures for sequential samplers) at intervals not to exceed 5 
minutes.
    (6) At the completion of the 4-hour sampling phase, terminate the 
sample period, if not terminated automatically by the sampler. Continue 
to measure and record the radiant flux, ambient temperature, and filter 
temperature or temperatures for 4 additional hours at intervals not to 
exceed 5 minutes. At the completion of the 4-hour post-sampling period, 
discontinue the measurements and turn off the solar source.
    (7) Download all archived sampler data from the test run.
    (g) Test results. Chamber radiant flux control. Examine the 
continuous record of the chamber radiant flux and verify that the flux 
met the requirements specified in table E-2 of this subpart at all times 
during the test. If not, the entire test is not valid and must be 
repeated.
    (1) Filter temperature measurement accuracy. (i) For each 4-hour 
test period, calculate the absolute value of the difference between the 
mean filter temperature indicated by the sampler (active filter) and the 
mean filter temperature measured by the reference temperature sensor 
installed within 1 cm downstream of the (active) filter as:
                               Equation 23
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.085

where:

T<INF>ind,filter</INF> = mean filter temperature indicated by the test 
sampler, [deg]C; and
T<INF>ref,filter</INF> = mean filter temperature measured by the 
reference temperature sensor, [deg]C.

    (ii) To successfully pass the indicated filter temperature accuracy 
test, the calculated difference between the measured means 
(T<INF>diff,filter</INF>) must not exceed 2 [deg]C for each 4-hour test 
period.
    (2) Ambient temperature measurement accuracy. (i) For each 4-hour 
test period, calculate the absolute value of the difference between the 
mean ambient air temperature indicated by the test sampler and the mean 
ambient air temperature measured by the reference ambient air 
temperature recorder as:
                               Equation 24
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.086

where:

T<INF>ind,ambient</INF> = mean ambient air temperature indicated by the 
test sampler, [deg]C; and
T<INF>ref,ambient</INF> = mean ambient air temperature measured by the 
reference ambient air temperature recorder, [deg]C.

    (ii) To successfully pass the indicated ambient temperature accuracy 
test, the calculated difference between the measured means 
(T<INF>diff,ambient</INF>) must not exceed 2 [deg]C for each 4-hour test 
period.

[[Page 95]]

    (3) Filter temperature control accuracy. (i) For each temperature 
measurement interval over each 4-hour test period, calculate the 
difference between the filter temperature indicated by the reference 
temperature sensor and the ambient temperature indicated by the test 
sampler as:
                               Equation 25
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.087

    (ii) Tabulate and inspect the calculated differences as a function 
of time. To successfully pass the indicated filter temperature control 
test, the calculated difference between the measured values must not 
exceed 5 [deg]C for any consecutive intervals covering more than a 30-
minute time period.
    (iii) For sequential samplers, repeat the test calculations for each 
of the stored sequential sample filters. All stored filters must also 
meet the 5 [deg]C temperature control test.

Sec. 53.58  Operational field precision and blank test.

    (a) Overview. This test is intended to determine the operational 
precision of the candidate sampler during a minimum of 10 days of field 
operation, using three collocated test samplers. Measurements of PM are 
made at a test site with all of the samplers and then compared to 
determine replicate precision. Candidate sequential samplers are also 
subject to a test for possible deposition of particulate matter on 
inactive filters during a period of storage in the sampler. This 
procedure is applicable to both reference and equivalent methods. In the 
case of equivalent methods, this test may be combined and conducted 
concurrently with the comparability test for equivalent methods 
(described in subpart C of this part), using three reference method 
samplers collocated with three candidate equivalent method samplers and 
meeting the applicable site and other requirements of subpart C of this 
part.
    (b) Technical definition. (1) Field precision is defined as the 
standard deviation or relative standard deviation of a set of PM 
measurements obtained concurrently with three or more collocated 
samplers in actual ambient air field operation.
    (2) Storage deposition is defined as the mass of material 
inadvertently deposited on a sample filter that is stored in a 
sequential sampler either prior to or subsequent to the active sample 
collection period.
    (c) Test site. Any outdoor test site having PM<INF>2.5</INF> (or 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF>, as applicable) concentrations that are reasonably 
uniform over the test area and that meet the minimum level requirement 
of paragraph (g)(2) of this section is acceptable for this test.
    (d) Required facilities and equipment. (1) An appropriate test site 
and suitable electrical power to accommodate three test samplers are 
required.
    (2) Teflon sample filters, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 
50, appendix L, conditioned and preweighed as required by section 8 of 
40 CFR part 50, appendix L, as needed for the test samples.
    (e) Test setup. (1) Three identical test samplers shall be installed 
at the test site in their normal configuration for collecting PM samples 
in accordance with the instructions in the associated manual referred to 
in Sec. 53.4(b)(3) and also in accordance with applicable supplemental 
guidance provided in reference 3 in appendix A of this subpart. The test 
samplers' inlet openings shall be located at the same height above 
ground and between 2 (1 for samplers with flow rates less than 200 L/
min.) and 4 meters apart horizontally. The samplers shall be arranged or 
oriented in a manner that will minimize the spatial and wind directional 
effects on sample collection of one sampler on any other sampler.
    (2) Each test sampler shall be successfully leak checked, 
calibrated, and set up for normal operation in accordance with the 
instruction manual and with any applicable supplemental guidance 
provided in reference 3 in appendix A of this subpart.
    (f) Test procedure. (1) Install a conditioned, preweighed filter in 
each test sampler and otherwise prepare each sampler for normal sample 
collection. Set identical sample collection start and stop times for 
each sampler. For

[[Page 96]]

sequential samplers, install a conditioned, preweighed specified filter 
in each available channel or station intended for automatic sequential 
sample filter collection (or at least five additional filters for 
magazine-type sequential samplers), as directed by the sampler's 
operation or instruction manual. Since the inactive sequential channels 
are used for the storage deposition part of the test, they may not be 
used to collect the active PM test samples.
    (2) Collect either a nominal 24-hour or 48-hour atmospheric PM 
sample simultaneously with each of the three test samplers.
    (3) Following sample collection, retrieve the collected sample from 
each sampler. For sequential samplers, retrieve the additional stored 
(blank, unsampled) filters after at least 5 days (120 hours) storage in 
the sampler if the active samples are 24-hour samples, or after at least 
10 days (240 hours) if the active samples are 48-hour samples.
    (4) Determine the measured PM mass concentration for each sample in 
accordance with the applicable procedures prescribed for the candidate 
method in appendix L or appendix O, as applicable, of part 50 of this 
chapter, and in accordance with the associated manual referred to in 
Sec. 53.4(b)(3) and supplemental guidance in reference 2 in appendix A 
of this subpart. For sequential samplers, also similarly determine the 
storage deposition as the net weight gain of each blank, unsampled 
filter after the 5-day (or 10-day) period of storage in the sampler.
    (5) Repeat this procedure to obtain a total of 10 sets of any 
combination of (nominal) 24-hour or 48-hour PM measurements over 10 test 
periods. For sequential samplers, repeat the 5-day (or 10-day) storage 
test of additional blank filters once for a total of two sets of blank 
filters.
    (g) Calculations. (1) Record the PM concentration for each test 
sampler for each test period as C<INF>i,j,</INF> where i is the sampler 
number (i = 1,2,3) and j is the test period (j = 1,2, * * * 10).
    (2)(i) For each test period, calculate and record the average of the 
three measured PM concentrations as C<INF>ave,j</INF> where j is the 
test period using equation 26 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.038

    (ii) If C<INF>ave,j</INF> < 3 [micro]g/m\3\ for any test period, 
data from that test period are unacceptable, and an additional sample 
collection set must be obtained to replace the unacceptable data.
    (3)(i) Calculate and record the precision for each of the 10 test 
periods, as the standard deviation, using equation 27 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.039

    (ii) For each of the 10 test periods, also calculate and record the 
precision as the relative standard deviation, in percent, using equation 
28 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.040

    (h) Test results. (1) The candidate method passes the precision test 
if either P<INF>j</INF> or RP<INF>j</INF> is less than or equal to the 
corresponding specification in table E-1 of this subpart for all 10 test 
periods.
    (2) The candidate sequential sampler passes the blank filter storage 
deposition test if the average net storage deposition weight gain of 
each set of blank filters (total of the net weight gain of each blank 
filter divided by the number of filters in the set) from each test 
sampler (six sets in all) is less than 50 [micro]g.

Sec. 53.59  Aerosol transport test for Class I equivalent method samplers.

    (a) Overview. This test is intended to verify adequate aerosol 
transport through any modified or air flow splitting components that may 
be used in a Class I candidate equivalent method sampler such as may be 
necessary to achieve sequential sampling capability. This test is 
applicable to all Class I candidate samplers in which the aerosol flow 
path (the flow path through which sample air passes upstream of sample 
collection filter) differs significantly from that specified for 
reference method samplers as specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or 
appendix O, as applicable. The test requirements and performance 
specifications for this test are summarized in table E-1 of this 
subpart.
    (b) Technical definitions. (1) Aerosol transport is the percentage 
of a laboratory challenge aerosol which penetrates to the active sample 
filter of the candidate equivalent method sampler.
    (2) The active sample filter is the exclusive filter through which 
sample air is flowing during performance of this test.
    (3) A no-flow filter is a sample filter through which no sample air 
is intended to flow during performance of this test.
    (4) A channel is any of two or more flow paths that the aerosol may 
take, only one of which may be active at a time.
    (5) An added component is any physical part of the sampler which is 
different in some way from that specified for a reference method sampler 
in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or appendix O, as applicable, such as a 
device or means to allow or cause the aerosol to be routed to one of 
several channels.
    (c) Required facilities and test equipment. (1) Aerosol generation 
system, as specified in Sec. 53.62(c)(2).
    (2) Aerosol delivery system, as specified in Sec. 53.64(c)(2).
    (3) Particle size verification equipment, as specified in Sec. 
53.62(c)(3).
    (4) Fluorometer, as specified in Sec. 53.62(c)(7).
    (5) Candidate test sampler, with the inlet and impactor or impactors 
removed, and with all internal surfaces of added components electroless 
nickel coated as specified in Sec. 53.64(d)(2).
    (6) Filters that are appropriate for use with fluorometric methods 
(e.g., glass fiber).
    (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit 
documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, 
certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if 
required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy 
of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest 
pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at 
zero and at least one flow rate within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent 
of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an 
instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording 
device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be 
calibrated or verified.
    (e) Test setup. (1) The candidate test sampler shall have its inlet 
and impactor or impactors removed. The lower end of the down tube shall 
be reconnected to the filter holder, using an extension of the downtube, 
if necessary. If the candidate sampler has a separate impactor for each 
channel, then for this test, the filter holder assemblies must be 
connected to the physical location on the sampler where the impactors 
would normally connect.
    (2) The test particle delivery system shall be connected to the 
sampler downtube so that the test aerosol is introduced at the top of 
the downtube.
    (f) Test procedure. (1) All surfaces of the added or modified 
component or components which come in contact with the aerosol flow 
shall be thoroughly washed with 0.01 N NaOH and then dried.

[[Page 98]]

    (2) Generate aerosol. (i) Generate aerosol composed of oleic acid 
with a uranine fluorometric tag of 3 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.25 [micro]m 
aerodynamic diameter using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator 
according to conventions specified in Sec. 53.61(g).
    (ii) Check for the presence of satellites and adjust the generator 
to minimize their production.
    (iii) Calculate the aerodynamic particle size using the operating 
parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. The calculated 
aerodynamic diameter must be 3 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.25 [micro]m 
aerodynamic diameter.
    (3) Verify the particle size according to procedures specified in 
Sec. 53.62(d)(4)(i).
    (4) Collect particles on filters for a time period such that the 
relative error of the resulting measured fluorometric concentration for 
the active filter is less than 5 percent.
    (5) Determine the quantity of material collected on the active 
filter using a calibrated fluorometer. Record the mass of fluorometric 
material for the active filter as M<INF>active (i)</INF> where i = the 
active channel number.
    (6) Determine the quantity of material collected on each no-flow 
filter using a calibrated fluorometer. Record the mass of fluorometric 
material on each no-flow filter as M<INF>no-flow.</INF>
    (7) Using 0.01 N NaOH, wash the surfaces of the added component or 
components which contact the aerosol flow. Determine the quantity of 
material collected using a calibrated fluorometer. Record the mass of 
fluorometric material collected in the wash as M<INF>wash</INF>.
    (8) Calculate the aerosol transport as:
                               Equation 29
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.091

where:

i = the active channel number.

    (9) Repeat paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section for each 
channel, making each channel in turn the exclusive active channel.
    (g) Test results. The candidate Class I sampler passes the aerosol 
transport test if T<INF>(i)</INF> is at least 97 percent for each 
channel.

Subpart F_Procedures for Testing Performance Characteristics of Class II 

                 Equivalent Methods for PM<INF>2.5</INF>

    Source: 62 FR 38814, July 18, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 53.60  General provisions.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the specific requirements that a 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> sampler associated with a candidate Class II equivalent 
method must meet to be designated as an equivalent method for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>. This subpart also sets forth the explicit test 
procedures that must be

[[Page 103]]

carried out and the test results, evidence, documentation, and other 
materials that must be provided to EPA to demonstrate that a sampler 
meets all specified requirements for designation as an equivalent 
method.
    (b) A candidate method described in an application for a FRM or FEM 
determination submitted under Sec. 53.4 shall be determined by the EPA 
to be a Class II candidate equivalent method on the basis of the 
definition of a Class II FEM in Sec. 53.1.
    (c) Any sampler associated with a Class II candidate equivalent 
method (Class II sampler) must meet all applicable requirements for FRM 
samplers or Class I FEM samplers specified in subpart E of this part, as 
appropriate. Except as provided in Sec. 53.3(a)(3), a Class II 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> sampler must meet the additional requirements as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this 
section, all Class II samplers are subject to the additional tests and 
performance requirements specified in Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel 
test), Sec. 53.65 (loading test), and Sec. 53.66 (volatility test). 
Alternative tests and performance requirements, as described in 
paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, are optionally 
available for certain Class II samplers which meet the requirements for 
reference method or Class I equivalent method samplers given in 40 CFR 
part 50, appendix L, and in subpart E of this part, except for specific 
deviations of the inlet, fractionator, or filter.
    (1) Inlet deviation. A sampler which has been determined to be a 
Class II sampler solely because the design or construction of its inlet 
deviates from the design or construction of the inlet specified in 40 
CFR part 50, appendix L, for reference method samplers shall not be 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), 
provided that it meets all requirements of Sec. 53.63 (wind tunnel 
inlet aspiration test), Sec. 53.65 (loading test), and Sec. 53.66 
(volatility test).
    (2) Fractionator deviation. A sampler which has been determined to 
be a Class II sampler solely because the design or construction of its 
particle size fractionator deviates from the design or construction of 
the particle size fractionator specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L 
for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the requirements 
of Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), provided that it meets all 
requirements of Sec. 53.64 (static fractionator test), Sec. 53.65 
(loading test), and Sec. 53.66 (volatility test).
    (3) Filter size deviation. A sampler which has been determined to be 
a Class II sampler solely because its effective filtration area deviates 
from that of the reference method filter specified in 40 CFR part 50, 
appendix L, for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel test) nor Sec. 53.65 
(loading test), provided it meets all requirements of Sec. 53.66 
(volatility test).
    (e) The test specifications and acceptance criteria for each test 
are summarized in table F-1 of this subpart. The candidate sampler must 
demonstrate performance that meets the acceptance criteria for each 
applicable test to be designated as an equivalent method.
    (f) Overview of various test procedures for Class II samplers--(1) 
Full wind tunnel test. This test procedure is designed to ensure that 
the candidate sampler's effectiveness (aspiration of an ambient aerosol 
and penetration of the sub 2.5-micron fraction to its sample filter) 
will be comparable to that of a reference method sampler. The candidate 
sampler is challenged at wind speeds of 2 and 24 km/hr with monodisperse 
aerosols of the size specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The 
experimental test results are then integrated with three idealized 
ambient distributions (typical, fine, and coarse) to yield the expected 
mass concentration measurement for each. The acceptance criteria are 
based on the results of this numerical analysis and the particle 
diameter for which the sampler effectiveness is 50 percent.
    (2) Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test. The wind tunnel inlet 
aspiration test directly compares the inlet of the candidate sampler to 
the inlet of a reference method sampler with the single-sized, liquid, 
monodisperse challenge aerosol specified in table F-2 of this subpart at 
wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr. The acceptance criteria, presented 
in table F-1 of this subpart, is

[[Page 104]]

based on the relative aspiration between the candidate inlet and the 
reference method inlet.
    (3) Static fractionator test. The static fractionator test 
determines the effectiveness of the candidate sampler's 2.5-micron 
fractionator under static conditions for aerosols of the size specified 
in table F-2 of this subpart. The numerical analysis procedures and 
acceptance criteria are identical to those in the full wind tunnel test.
    (4) Loading test. The loading test is conducted to ensure that the 
performance of a candidate sampler is not significantly affected by the 
amount of particulate deposited on its interior surfaces between 
periodic cleanings. The candidate sampler is artificially loaded by 
sampling a test environment containing aerosolized, standard test dust. 
The duration of the loading phase is dependent on both the time between 
cleaning as specified by the candidate method and the aerosol mass 
concentration in the test environment. After loading, the candidate's 
performance must then be evaluated by Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel 
evaluation), Sec. 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or Sec. 
53.64 (static fractionator test). If the results of the appropriate test 
meet the criteria presented in table F-1 of this subpart, then the 
candidate sampler passes the loading test under the condition that it be 
cleaned at least as often as the cleaning frequency proposed by the 
candidate method and that has been demonstrated to be acceptable by this 
test.
    (5) Volatility test. The volatility test challenges the candidate 
sampler with a polydisperse, semi-volatile liquid aerosol. This aerosol 
is simultaneously sampled by the candidate method sampler and a 
reference method sampler for a specified time period. Clean air is then 
passed through the samplers during a blow-off time period. Residual mass 
is then calculated as the weight of the filter after the blow-off phase 
is subtracted from the initial weight of the filter. Acceptance criteria 
are based on a comparison of the residual mass measured by the candidate 
sampler (corrected for flow rate variations from that of the reference 
method) to the residual mass measured by the reference method sampler 
for several specified clean air sampling time periods.
    (g) Test data. All test data and other documentation obtained from 
or pertinent to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the 
analyst performing the test, and submitted to EPA as part of the 
equivalent method application. Schematic drawings of each particle 
delivery system and other information showing complete procedural 
details of the test atmosphere generation, verification, and delivery 
techniques for each test performed shall be submitted to EPA. All 
pertinent calculations shall be clearly presented. In addition, 
manufacturers are required to submit as part of the application, a 
Designation Testing Checklist (Figure F-1 of this subpart) which has 
been completed and signed by an ISO-certified auditor.

<R05>
Sec. 53.61  Test conditions.

    (a) Sampler surface preparation. Internal surfaces of the candidate 
sampler shall be cleaned and dried prior to performing any Class II 
sampler test in this subpart. The internal collection surfaces of the 
sampler shall then be prepared in strict accordance with the operating 
instructions specified in the sampler's operating manual referred to in 
section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.
    (b) Sampler setup. Set up and start up of all test samplers shall be 
in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the 
manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, 
unless otherwise specified within this subpart.
    (c) Sampler adjustments. Once the test sampler or samplers have been 
set up and the performance tests started, manual adjustment shall be 
permitted only between test points for all applicable tests. Manual 
adjustments and any periodic maintenance shall be limited to only those 
procedures prescribed in the manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 
CFR part 50, appendix L. The submitted records shall clearly indicate 
when any manual adjustment or periodic maintenance was made and shall 
describe the operations performed.

[[Page 105]]

    (d) Sampler malfunctions. If a test sampler malfunctions during any 
of the applicable tests, that test run shall be repeated. A detailed 
explanation of all malfunctions and the remedial actions taken shall be 
submitted as part of the equivalent method application.
    (e) Particle concentration measurements. All measurements of 
particle concentration must be made such that the relative error in 
measurement is less than 5.0 percent. Relative error is defined as (s x 
100 percent)/(X), where s is the sample standard deviation of the 
particle concentration detector, X is the measured concentration, and 
the units of s and X are identical.
    (f) Operation of test measurement equipment. All test measurement 
equipment shall be set up, calibrated, and maintained by qualified 
personnel according to the manufacturer's instructions. All appropriate 
calibration information and manuals for this equipment shall be kept on 
file.
    (g) Vibrating orifice aerosol generator conventions. This section 
prescribes conventions regarding the use of the vibrating orifice 
aerosol generator (VOAG) for the size-selective performance tests 
outlined in Sec. Sec. 53.62, 53.63, 53.64, and 53.65.
    (1) Particle aerodynamic diameter. The VOAG produces near-
monodisperse droplets through the controlled breakup of a liquid jet. 
When the liquid solution consists of a non-volatile solute dissolved in 
a volatile solvent, the droplets dry to form particles of near-
monodisperse size.
    (i) The physical diameter of a generated spherical particle can be 
calculated from the operating parameters of the VOAG as:
                               Equation 1
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.094

where:

D<INF>p</INF> = particle physical diameter, [micro]m;
Q = liquid volumetric flow rate, [micro]m\3\/sec;
C<INF>vol</INF> = volume concentration (particle volume produced per 
drop volume), dimensionless; and
f = frequency of applied vibrational signal, 1/sec.

    (ii) A given particle's aerodynamic behavior is a function of its 
physical particle size, particle shape, and density. Aerodynamic 
diameter is defined as the diameter of a unit density ([rho]<INF>o</INF> 
= 1g/cm\3\) sphere having the same settling velocity as the particle 
under consideration. For converting a spherical particle of known 
density to aerodynamic diameter, the governing relationship is:
                               Equation 2
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.095

where:

D<INF>ae</INF> = particle aerodynamic diameter, [micro]m;
[rho]<INF>p</INF> = particle density, g/cm\3\;
[rho]<INF>o</INF> = aerodynamic particle density = 1 g/cm\3\;
C<INF>Dp</INF> = Cunningham's slip correction factor for physical 
particle diameter, dimensionless; and
C<INF>Dae</INF> = Cunningham's slip correction factor for aerodynamic 
particle diameter, dimensionless.

    (iii) At room temperature and standard pressure, the Cunningham's 
slip correction factor is solely a function of particle diameter:
                               Equation 3
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.096


or
                               Equation 4
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.097

    (iv) Since the slip correction factor is itself a function of 
particle diameter, the aerodynamic diameter in equation 2 of paragraph 
(g)(1)(ii) of this section cannot be solved directly but must be 
determined by iteration.
    (2) Solid particle generation. (i) Solid particle tests performed in 
this subpart shall be conducted using particles composed of ammonium 
fluorescein. For use in the VOAG, liquid solutions of known volumetric 
concentration can be prepared by diluting fluorescein

[[Page 106]]

powder (C<INF>2</INF>0H<INF>12</INF>O<INF>5</INF>, FW = 332.31, CAS 
2321-07-5) with aqueous ammonia. Guidelines for preparation of 
fluorescein solutions of the desired volume concentration 
(C<INF>vol</INF>) are presented by Vanderpool and Rubow (1988) 
(Reference 2 in appendix A of this subpart). For purposes of converting 
particle physical diameter to aerodynamic diameter, an ammonium 
fluorescein density of 1.35 g/cm\3\ shall be used.
    (ii) Mass deposits of ammonium fluorescein shall be extracted and 
analyzed using solutions of 0.01 N ammonium hydroxide.
    (3) Liquid particle generation. (i) Tests prescribed in Sec. 53.63 
for inlet aspiration require the use of liquid particle tests composed 
of oleic acid tagged with uranine to enable subsequent fluorometric 
quantitation of collected aerosol mass deposits. Oleic acid 
(C<INF>18</INF>H<INF>34</INF>O<INF>2</INF>, FW = 282.47, CAS 112-80-1) 
has a density of 0.8935 g/cm\3\. Because the viscosity of oleic acid is 
relatively high, significant errors can occur when dispensing oleic acid 
using volumetric pipettes. For this reason, it is recommended that oleic 
acid solutions be prepared by quantifying dispensed oleic acid 
gravimetrically. The volume of oleic acid dispensed can then be 
calculated simply by dividing the dispensed mass by the oleic acid 
density.
    (ii) Oleic acid solutions tagged with uranine shall be prepared as 
follows. A known mass of oleic acid shall first be diluted using 
absolute ethanol. The desired mass of the uranine tag should then be 
diluted in a separate container using absolute ethanol. Uranine 
(C<INF>20</INF>H<INF>10</INF>O<INF>5</INF>Na<INF>2</INF>, FW = 376.3, 
CAS 518-47-8) is the disodium salt of fluorescein and has a density of 
1.53 g/cm\3\. In preparing uranine tagged oleic acid particles, the 
uranine content shall not exceed 20 percent on a mass basis. Once both 
oleic acid and uranine solutions are properly prepared, they can then be 
combined and diluted to final volume using absolute ethanol.
    (iii) Calculation of the physical diameter of the particles produced 
by the VOAG requires knowledge of the liquid solution's volume 
concentration (C<INF>vol</INF>). Because uranine is essentially 
insoluble in oleic acid, the total particle volume is the sum of the 
oleic acid volume and the uranine volume. The volume concentration of 
the liquid solution shall be calculated as:
                               Equation 5
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.098

where:

V<INF>u</INF> = uranine volume, ml;
V<INF>oleic</INF> = oleic acid volume, ml;
V<INF>sol</INF> = total solution volume, ml;
M<INF>u</INF> = uranine mass, g;
[rho]<INF>u</INF> = uranine density, g/cm\3\;
M<INF>oleic</INF> = oleic acid mass, g; and
[rho]<INF>oleic</INF> = oleic acid density, g/cm\3\.

    (iv) For purposes of converting the particles' physical diameter to 
aerodynamic diameter, the density of the generated particles shall be 
calculated as:
                               Equation 6
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.099

    (v) Mass deposits of oleic acid shall be extracted and analyzed 
using solutions of 0.01 N sodium hydroxide.

Sec. 53.62  Test procedure: Full wind tunnel test.

    (a) Overview. The full wind tunnel test evaluates the effectiveness 
of the candidate sampler at 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr for aerosols of the 
size specified in table F-2 of this subpart (under the heading, ``Full 
Wind Tunnel Test''). For each wind speed, a smooth curve is fit to the 
effectiveness data and corrected for the presence of multiplets in the 
wind tunnel calibration aerosol. The cutpoint diameter (D<INF>p50</INF>) 
at each wind speed is then determined from the corrected effectiveness 
curves. The two resultant penetration curves are then each numerically 
integrated with three idealized ambient particle size distributions to 
provide six estimates of measured mass concentration. Critical 
parameters for these idealized distributions are presented in table F-3 
of this subpart.

[[Page 107]]

    (b) Technical definitions. Effectiveness is the ratio (expressed as 
a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a specific size 
reaching the sampler filter or filters to the mass concentration of 
particles of the same size approaching the sampler.
    (c) Facilities and equipment required--(1) Wind tunnel. The particle 
delivery system shall consist of a blower system and a wind tunnel 
having a test section of sufficiently large cross-sectional area such 
that the test sampler, or portion thereof, as installed in the test 
section for testing, blocks no more than 15 percent of the test section 
area. The wind tunnel blower system must be capable of maintaining 
uniform wind speeds at the 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr in the test section.
    (2) Aerosol generation system. A vibrating orifice aerosol generator 
shall be used to produce monodisperse solid particles of ammonium 
fluorescein with equivalent aerodynamic diameters as specified in table 
F-2 of this subpart. The geometric standard deviation for each particle 
size generated shall not exceed 1.1 (for primary particles) and the 
proportion of multiplets (doublets and triplets) in all test particle 
atmosphere shall not exceed 10 percent of the particle population. The 
aerodynamic particle diameter, as established by the operating 
parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator, shall be within 
the tolerance specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
    (3) Particle size verification equipment. The size of the test 
particles shall be verified during this test by use of a suitable 
instrument (e.g., scanning electron microscope, optical particle sizer, 
time-of-flight apparatus). The instrument must be capable of measuring 
solid and liquid test particles with a size resolution of 0.1 [micro]m 
or less. The accuracy of the particle size verification technique shall 
be 0.15 [micro]m or better.
    (4) Wind speed measurement. The wind speed in the wind tunnel shall 
be determined during the tests using an appropriate technique capable of 
a precision of 2 percent and an accuracy of 5 percent or better (e.g., 
hot-wire anemometry). For the wind speeds specified in table F-2 of this 
subpart, the wind speed shall be measured at a minimum of 12 test points 
in a cross-sectional area of the test section of the wind tunnel. The 
mean wind speed in the test section must be within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent of the value specified in table F-2 of this 
subpart, and the variation at any test point in the test section may not 
exceed 10 percent of the measured mean.
    (5) Aerosol rake. The cross-sectional uniformity of the particle 
concentration in the sampling zone of the test section shall be 
established during the tests using an array of isokinetic samplers, 
referred to as a rake. Not less than five evenly spaced isokinetic 
samplers shall be used to determine the particle concentration spatial 
uniformity in the sampling zone. The sampling zone shall be a 
rectangular area having a horizontal dimension not less than 1.2 times 
the width of the test sampler at its inlet opening and a vertical 
dimension not less than 25 centimeters.
    (6) Total aerosol isokinetic sampler. After cross-sectional 
uniformity has been confirmed, a single isokinetic sampler may be used 
in place of the array of isokinetic samplers for the determination of 
particle mass concentration used in the calculation of sampling 
effectiveness of the test sampler in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. 
In this case, the array of isokinetic samplers must be used to 
demonstrate particle concentration uniformity prior to the replicate 
measurements of sampling effectiveness.
    (7) Fluorometer. A fluorometer used for quantifying extracted 
aerosol mass deposits shall be set up, maintained, and calibrated 
according to the manufacturer's instructions. A series of calibration 
standards shall be prepared to encompass the minimum and maximum 
concentrations measured during size-selective tests. Prior to each 
calibration and measurement, the fluorometer shall be zeroed using an 
aliquot of the same solvent used for extracting aerosol mass deposits.
    (8) Sampler flow rate measurements. All flow rate measurements used 
to calculate the test atmosphere concentrations and the test results 
must be accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent, referenced 
to a NIST-traceable primary standard. Any necessary flow rate 
measurement

[[Page 108]]

corrections shall be clearly documented. All flow rate measurements 
shall be performed and reported in actual volumetric units.
    (d) Test procedures--(1) Establish and verify wind speed. (i) 
Establish a wind speed specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
    (ii) Measure the wind speed at a minimum of 12 test points in a 
cross-sectional area of the test section of the wind tunnel using a 
device as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (iii) Verify that the mean wind speed in the test section of the 
wind tunnel during the tests is within 10 percent of the value specified 
in table F-2 of this subpart. The wind speed measured at any test point 
in the test section shall not differ by more than 10 percent from the 
mean wind speed in the test section.
    (2) Generate aerosol. (i) Generate particles of a size specified in 
table F-2 of this subpart using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator.
    (ii) Check for the presence of satellites and adjust the generator 
as necessary.
    (iii) Calculate the physical particle size using the operating 
parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator and record.
    (iv) Determine the particle's aerodynamic diameter from the 
calculated physical diameter and the known density of the generated 
particle. The calculated aerodynamic diameter must be within the 
tolerance specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
    (3) Introduce particles into the wind tunnel. Introduce the 
generated particles into the wind tunnel and allow the particle 
concentration to stabilize.
    (4) Verify the quality of the test aerosol. (i) Extract a 
representative sample of the aerosol from the sampling test zone and 
measure the size distribution of the collected particles using an 
appropriate sizing technique. If the measurement technique does not 
provide a direct measure of aerodynamic diameter, the geometric mean 
aerodynamic diameter of the challenge aerosol must be calculated using 
the known density of the particle and the measured mean physical 
diameter. The determined geometric mean aerodynamic diameter of the test 
aerosol must be within 0.15 [micro]m of the aerodynamic diameter 
calculated from the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice 
aerosol generator. The geometric standard deviation of the primary 
particles must not exceed 1.1.
    (ii) Determine the population of multiplets in the collected sample. 
The multiplet population of the particle test atmosphere must not exceed 
10 percent of the total particle population.
    (5) Aerosol uniformity and concentration measurement. (i) Install an 
array of five or more evenly spaced isokinetic samplers in the sampling 
zone (paragraph (c)(5) of this section). Collect particles on 
appropriate filters over a time period such that the relative error of 
the measured particle concentration is less than 5.0 percent.
    (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with each 
isokinetic sampler in the array using a calibrated fluorometer. 
Calculate and record the mass concentration for each isokinetic sampler 
as:
                               Equation 7
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.100

where:

i = replicate number;
j = isokinetic sampler number;
M<INF>iso</INF> = mass of material collected with the isokinetic 
sampler;
Q = isokinetic sampler volumetric flow rate; and
t = sampling time.

    (iii) Calculate and record the mean mass concentration as:
                               Equation 8
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.101

where:

i = replicate number;
j = isokinetic sampler number; and
n = total number of isokinetic samplers.

    (iv) Precision calculation. (A) Calculate the coefficient of 
variation of

[[Page 109]]

                               Equation 9
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.102

where:

i = replicate number;
j = isokinetic sampler number; and
n = total number of isokinetic samplers.

    (B) If the value of CV<INF>iso(i)</INF> for any replicate exceeds 10 
percent, the particle concentration uniformity is unacceptable and step 
5 must be repeated. If adjustment of the vibrating orifice aerosol 
generator or changes in the particle delivery system are necessary to 
achieve uniformity, steps 1 through 5 must be repeated. When an 
acceptable aerosol spatial uniformity is achieved, remove the array of 
isokinetic samplers from the wind tunnel.
    (6) Alternative measure of wind tunnel total concentration. If a 
single isokinetic sampler is used to determine the mean aerosol 
concentration in the wind tunnel, install the sampler in the wind tunnel 
with the sampler nozzle centered in the sampling zone (paragraph (c)(6) 
of this section).
    (i) Collect particles on an appropriate filter over a time period 
such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 
5.0 percent.
    (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the 
isokinetic sampler using a calibrated fluorometer.
    (iii) Calculate and record the mass concentration as 
C<INF>iso(i)</INF> as in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Remove the isokinetic sampler from the wind tunnel.
    (7) Measure the aerosol with the candidate sampler. (i) Install the 
test sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler 
inlet opening centered in the sampling zone. To meet the maximum 
blockage limit of paragraph (c)(1) of this section or for convenience, 
part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel 
provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any 
connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period 
such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 
5.0 percent.
    (ii) Remove the test sampler from the wind tunnel.
    (iii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the test 
sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass 
concentration for each replicate as:
                               Equation 10
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.103

where:

i = replicate number;
M<INF>cand</INF> = mass of material collected with the candidate 
sampler;
Q = candidate sampler volumetric flow rate; and
t = sampling time.

    (iv)(A) Calculate and record the sampling effectiveness of the 
candidate sampler as:
                               Equation 11
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.104

where:

i = replicate number.

    (B) If a single isokinetic sampler is used for the determination of 
particle mass concentration, replace C<INF>iso(i)</INF> with 
C<INF>iso</INF>.
    (8) Replicate measurements and calculation of mean sampling 
effectiveness. (i) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(5) through (d)(7) of 
this section, as appropriate, to obtain a minimum of three valid 
replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.
    (ii) Calculate and record the average sampling effectiveness of the 
test sampler for the particle size as:
                               Equation 12
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.105

where:

i = replicate number; and

[[Page 110]]

n = number of replicates.

    (iii) Sampling effectiveness precision. (A) Calculate and record the 
coefficient of variation for the replicate sampling effectiveness 
measurements of the test sampler as:
                               Equation 13
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.106

where:

i = replicate number, and
n = number of replicates.

    (B) If the value of CV<INF>E</INF> exceeds 10 percent, the test run 
(steps in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(8) of this section) must be 
repeated until an acceptable value is obtained.
    (9) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(8) of this section 
until the sampling effectiveness has been measured for all particle 
sizes specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
    (10) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(9) of this 
section until tests have been successfully conducted for both wind 
speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr.
    (e) Calculations--(1) Graphical treatment of effectiveness data. For 
each wind speed given in table F-2 of this subpart, plot the particle 
average sampling effectiveness of the candidate sampler as a function of 
aerodynamic particle diameter (D<INF>ae</INF>) on semi-logarithmic graph 
paper where the aerodynamic particle diameter is the particle size 
established by the parameters of the VOAG in conjunction with the known 
particle density. Construct a best-fit, smooth curve through the data by 
extrapolating the sampling effectiveness curve through 100 percent at an 
aerodynamic particle size of 0.5 [micro]m and 0 percent at an 
aerodynamic particle size of 10 [micro]m. Correction for the presence of 
multiplets shall be performed using the techniques presented by Marple, 
et al (1987). This multiplet-corrected effectiveness curve shall be used 
for all remaining calculations in this paragraph (e).
    (2) Cutpoint determination. For each wind speed determine the 
sampler Dp<INF>50</INF> cutpoint defined as the aerodynamic particle 
size corresponding to 50 percent effectiveness from the multiplet 
corrected smooth curve.
    (3) Expected mass concentration calculation. For each wind speed, 
calculate the estimated mass concentration measurement for the test 
sampler under each particle size distribution (Tables F-4, F-5, and F-6 
of this subpart) and compare it to the mass concentration predicted for 
the reference sampler as follows:
    (i) Determine the value of corrected effectiveness using the best-
fit, multiplet-corrected curve at each of the particle sizes specified 
in the first column of table F-4 of this subpart. Record each corrected 
effectiveness value as a decimal between 0 and 1 in column 2 of table F-
4 of this subpart.
    (ii) Calculate the interval estimated mass concentration measurement 
by multiplying the values of corrected effectiveness in column 2 by the 
interval mass concentration values in column 3 and enter the products in 
column 4 of table F-4 of this subpart.
    (iii) Calculate the estimated mass concentration measurement by 
summing the values in column 4 and entering the total as the estimated 
mass concentration measurement for the test sampler at the bottom of 
column 4 of table F-4 of this subpart.
    (iv) Calculate the estimated mass concentration ratio between the 
candidate method and the reference method as:
                               Equation 14
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.107

where:

C<INF>cand(est)</INF> = estimated mass concentration measurement for the 
test sampler, [micro]g/m\3\; and
C<INF>ref(est)</INF> = estimated mass concentration measurement for the 
reference sampler, [micro]g/m\3\ (calculated for the reference sampler 
and specified at the bottom of column 7 of table F-4 of this subpart).

    (v) Repeat steps in paragraphs (e) (1) through (e)(3) of this 
section for tables F-5 and F-6 of this subpart.
    (f) Evaluation of test results. The candidate method passes the wind 
tunnel

effectiveness test if the R<INF>c</INF> value for each wind speed meets 
the specification in table F-1 of this subpart for each of the three 
particle size distributions.

Sec. 53.63  Test procedure: Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test.

    (a) Overview. This test applies to a candidate sampler which differs 
from the reference method sampler only with respect to the design of the 
inlet. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the aspiration of a 
Class II candidate sampler is such that it representatively extracts an 
ambient aerosol at elevated wind speeds. This wind tunnel test uses a 
single-sized, liquid aerosol in conjunction with wind speeds of 2 km/hr 
and 24 km/hr. The test atmosphere concentration is alternately measured 
with the candidate sampler and a reference method device, both of which 
are operated without the 2.5-micron fractionation device installed. The 
test conditions are summarized in table F-2 of this subpart (under the 
heading of ``wind tunnel inlet aspiration test''). The candidate sampler 
must meet or exceed the acceptance criteria given in table F-1 of this 
subpart.
    (b) Technical definition. Relative aspiration is the ratio 
(expressed as a percentage) of the aerosol mass concentration measured 
by the candidate sampler to that measured by a reference method sampler.
    (c) Facilities and equipment required. The facilities and equipment 
are identical to those required for the full wind tunnel test (Sec. 
53.62(c)).
    (d) Setup. The candidate and reference method samplers shall be 
operated with the PM<INF>2.5</INF> fractionation device removed from the 
flow path throughout this entire test procedure. Modifications to 
accommodate this requirement shall be limited to removal of the 
fractionator and insertion of the filter holder directly into the 
downtube of the inlet.
    (e) Test procedure--(1) Establish the wind tunnel test atmosphere. 
Follow the procedures in Sec. 53.62(d)(1) through (d)(4) to establish a 
test atmosphere for one of the two wind speeds specified in table F-2 of 
this subpart.
    (2) Measure the aerosol concentration with the reference sampler. 
(i) Install the reference sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind 
tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone. To 
meet the maximum blockage limit of Sec. 53.62(c)(1) or for convenience, 
part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel 
provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any 
connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period 
such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 
5.0 percent.
    (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the reference 
method sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the 
mass concentration as:
                               Equation 15
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.108

where:

i = replicate number;
M<INF>ref</INF> = mass of material collected with the reference method 
sampler;
Q = reference method sampler volumetric flow rate; and
t = sampling time.

    (iii) Remove the reference method sampler from the tunnel.
    (3) Measure the aerosol concentration with the candidate sampler. 
(i) Install the candidate sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind 
tunnel with the sampler inlet centered in the sampling zone. To meet the 
maximum blockage limit of Sec. 53.62(c)(1) or for convenience, part of 
the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided 
that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any 
connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period 
such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 
5.0 percent.
    (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the candidate 
sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass 
concentration as:

[[Page 112]]

                               Equation 16
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.109

where:

i = replicate number;
M<INF>cand</INF> = mass of material collected with the candidate 
sampler;
Q = candidate sampler volumetric flow rate; and
t = sampling time.

    (iii) Remove the candidate sampler from the wind tunnel.
    (4) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d) (2) and (d)(3) of this section. 
Alternately measure the tunnel concentration with the reference sampler 
and the candidate sampler until four reference sampler and three 
candidate sampler measurements of the wind tunnel concentration are 
obtained.
    (5) Calculations. (i) Calculate and record aspiration ratio for each 
candidate sampler run as:
                               Equation 17
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.110

where:

i = replicate number.

    (ii) Calculate and record the mean aspiration ratio as:
                               Equation 18
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.111

where:

i = replicate number; and
n = total number of measurements of aspiration ratio.

    (iii) Precision of the aspiration ratio. (A) Calculate and record 
the precision of the aspiration ratio measurements as the coefficient of 
variation as:
                               Equation 19
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.112

where:

i = replicate number; and
n = total number of measurements of aspiration ratio.

    (B) If the value of CV<INF>A</INF> exceeds 10 percent, the entire 
test procedure must be repeated.
    (f) Evaluation of test results. The candidate method passes the 
inlet aspiration test if all values of A meet the acceptance criteria 
specified in table F-1 of this subpart.

Sec. 53.64  Test procedure: Static fractionator test.

    (a) Overview. This test applies only to those candidate methods in 
which the sole deviation from the reference method is in the design of 
the 2.5-micron fractionation device. The purpose of this test is to 
ensure that the fractionation characteristics of the candidate 
fractionator are acceptably similar to that of the reference method 
sampler. It is recognized that various methodologies exist for 
quantifying fractionator effectiveness. The following commonly-employed 
techniques are provided for purposes of guidance. Other methodologies 
for determining sampler effectiveness may be used contingent upon prior 
approval by the Agency.
    (1) Wash-off method. Effectiveness is determined by measuring the 
aerosol mass deposited on the candidate sampler's after filter versus 
the aerosol mass deposited in the fractionator. The material deposited 
in the fractionator is recovered by washing its internal surfaces. For 
these wash-off tests, a fluorometer must be used to quantitate the 
aerosol concentration. Note that if this technique is chosen, the 
candidate must be reloaded with coarse aerosol prior to each test point 
when reevaluating the curve as specified in the loading test.
    (2) Static chamber method. Effectiveness is determined by measuring 
the aerosol mass concentration sampled by

[[Page 113]]

the candidate sampler's after filter versus that which exists in a 
static chamber. A calibrated fluorometer shall be used to quantify the 
collected aerosol deposits. The aerosol concentration is calculated as 
the measured aerosol mass divided by the sampled air volume.
    (3) Divided flow method. Effectiveness is determined by comparing 
the aerosol concentration upstream of the candidate sampler's 
fractionator versus that concentration which exists downstream of the 
candidate fractionator. These tests may utilize either fluorometry or a 
real-time aerosol measuring device to determine the aerosol 
concentration.
    (b) Technical definition. Effectiveness under static conditions is 
the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of 
particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass 
concentration of particles of the same size existing in the test 
atmosphere.
    (c) Facilities and equipment required--(1) Aerosol generation. 
Methods for generating aerosols shall be identical to those prescribed 
in Sec. 53.62(c)(2).
    (2) Particle delivery system. Acceptable apparatus for delivering 
the generated aerosols to the candidate fractionator is dependent on the 
effectiveness measurement methodology and shall be defined as follows:
    (i) Wash-off test apparatus. The aerosol may be delivered to the 
candidate fractionator through direct piping (with or without an in-line 
mixing chamber). Validation particle size and quality shall be conducted 
at a point directly upstream of the fractionator.
    (ii) Static chamber test apparatus. The aerosol shall be introduced 
into a chamber and sufficiently mixed such that the aerosol 
concentration within the chamber is spatially uniform. The chamber must 
be of sufficient size to house at least four total filter samplers in 
addition to the inlet of the candidate method size fractionator. 
Validation of particle size and quality shall be conducted on 
representative aerosol samples extracted from the chamber.
    (iii) Divided flow test apparatus. The apparatus shall allow the 
aerosol concentration to be measured upstream and downstream of the 
fractionator. The aerosol shall be delivered to a manifold with two 
symmetrical branching legs. One of the legs, referred to as the bypass 
leg, shall allow the challenge aerosol to pass unfractionated to the 
detector. The other leg shall accommodate the fractionation device.
    (3) Particle concentration measurement--(i) Fluorometry. Refer to 
Sec. 53.62(c)(7).
    (ii) Number concentration measurement. A number counting particle 
sizer may be used in conjunction with the divided flow test apparatus in 
lieu of fluorometric measurement. This device must have a minimum range 
of 1 to 10 [micro]m, a resolution of 0.1 [micro]m, and an accuracy of 
0.15 [micro]m such that primary particles may be distinguished from 
multiplets for all test aerosols. The measurement of number 
concentration shall be accomplished by integrating the primary particle 
peak.
    (d) Setup--(1) Remove the inlet and downtube from the candidate 
fractionator. All tests procedures shall be conducted with the inlet and 
downtube removed from the candidate sampler.
    (2) Surface treatment of the fractionator. Rinsing aluminum surfaces 
with alkaline solutions has been found to adversely affect subsequent 
fluorometric quantitation of aerosol mass deposits. If wash-off tests 
are to be used for quantifying aerosol penetration, internal surfaces of 
the fractionator must first be plated with electroless nickel. 
Specifications for this plating are specified in Society of Automotive 
Engineers Aerospace Material Specification (SAE AMS) 2404C, Electroless 
Nickel Plating (Reference 3 in appendix A of subpart F).
    (e) Test procedure: Wash-off method--(1) Clean the candidate 
sampler. Note: The procedures in this step may be omitted if this test 
is being used to evaluate the fractionator after being loaded as 
specified in Sec. 53.65.
    (i) Clean and dry the internal surfaces of the candidate sampler.
    (ii) Prepare the internal fractionator surfaces in strict accordance 
with the operating instructions specified in the sampler's operating 
manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.

Sec. 53.65  Test procedure: Loading test.

    (a) Overview. (1) The loading tests are designed to quantify any 
appreciable changes in a candidate method sampler's performance as a 
function of coarse aerosol collection. The candidate sampler is exposed 
to a mass of coarse aerosol equivalent to sampling a mass concentration 
of 150 [micro]g/m\3\ over the time period that the manufacturer has 
specified between periodic cleaning. After loading, the candidate 
sampler is then evaluated by performing the test in Sec. 53.62 (full 
wind tunnel test), Sec. 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or 
Sec. 53.64 (static fractionator test). If the acceptance criteria are 
met for this evaluation test, then the candidate sampler is approved for 
multi-day sampling with the periodic maintenance schedule as specified 
by the candidate method. For example, if the candidate sampler passes 
the reevaluation tests following loading with an aerosol mass equivalent 
to sampling a 150 [micro]g/m\3\ aerosol continuously for 7 days, then 
the sampler is approved for 7 day field operation before cleaning is 
required.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Technical definition. Effectiveness after loading is the ratio 
(expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a 
given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass concentration of 
particles of the same size approaching the sampler.
    (c) Facilities and equipment required--(1) Particle delivery system. 
The particle delivery system shall consist of a static chamber or a low 
velocity wind tunnel having a sufficiently large cross-sectional area 
such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, may be installed in the 
test section. At a minimum, the system must have a sufficiently large 
cross section to house the candidate sampler inlet as well as a 
collocated isokinetic nozzle for measuring total aerosol concentration. 
The mean velocity in the test section of the static chamber or wind 
tunnel shall not exceed 2 km/hr.
    (2) Aerosol generation equipment. For purposes of these tests, the 
test aerosol shall be produced from commercially available, bulk Arizona 
road dust. To provide direct interlaboratory comparability of sampler 
loading characteristics, the bulk dust is specified as 0-10 [micro]m ATD 
available from Powder Technology Incorporated (Burnsville, MN). A 
fluidized bed aerosol generator,

[[Page 119]]

Wright dust feeder, or sonic nozzle shall be used to efficiently 
deagglomerate the bulk test dust and transform it into an aerosol cloud. 
Other dust generators may be used contingent upon prior approval by the 
Agency.
    (3) Isokinetic sampler. Mean aerosol concentration within the static 
chamber or wind tunnel shall be established using a single isokinetic 
sampler containing a preweighed high-efficiency total filter.
    (4) Analytic balance. An analytical balance shall be used to 
determine the weight of the total filter in the isokinetic sampler. The 
precision and accuracy of this device shall be such that the relative 
measurement error is less than 5.0 percent for the difference between 
the initial and final weight of the total filter. The identical analytic 
balance shall be used to perform both initial and final weighing of the 
total filter.
    (d) Test procedure. (1) Calculate and record the target time 
weighted concentration of Arizona road dust which is equivalent to 
exposing the sampler to an environment of 150 [micro]g/m\3\ over the 
time between cleaning specified by the candidate sampler's operations 
manual as:
                               Equation 40
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.133

where:

t = the number of hours specified by the candidate method prior to 
periodic cleaning.

    (2) Clean the candidate sampler. (i) Clean and dry the internal 
surfaces of the candidate sampler.
    (ii) Prepare the internal surfaces in strict accordance with the 
operating manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, 
appendix L.
    (3) Determine the preweight of the filter that shall be used in the 
isokinetic sampler. Record this value as InitWt.
    (4) Install the candidate sampler's inlet and the isokinetic sampler 
within the test chamber or wind tunnel.
    (5) Generate a dust cloud. (i) Generate a dust cloud composed of 
Arizona test dust.
    (ii) Introduce the dust cloud into the chamber.
    (iii) Allow sufficient time for the particle concentration to become 
steady within the chamber.
    (6) Sample aerosol with a total filter and the candidate sampler. 
(i) Sample the aerosol for a time sufficient to produce an equivalent 
TWC equal to that of the target TWC <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>15 percent.
    (ii) Record the sampling time as t.
    (7) Determine the time weighted concentration. (i) Determine the 
postweight of the isokinetic sampler's total filter.
    (ii) Record this value as FinalWt.
    (iii) Calculate and record the TWC as:
                               Equation 41
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.134

where:

Q = the flow rate of the candidate method.

    (iv) If the value of TWC deviates from the target TWC <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>15 percent, then the loaded mass is unacceptable and the 
entire test procedure must be repeated.
    (8) Determine the candidate sampler's effectiveness after loading. 
The candidate sampler's effectiveness as a function of particle 
aerodynamic diameter must then be evaluated by performing the test in 
Sec. 53.62 (full wind tunnel test). A sampler which fits the category 
of inlet deviation in Sec. 53.60(e)(1) may opt to perform the test in 
Sec. 53.63 (inlet aspiration test) in lieu of the full wind tunnel 
test. A sampler which fits the category of fractionator deviation in 
Sec. 53.60(e)(2) may opt to perform the test in Sec. 53.64 (static 
fractionator test) in lieu of the full wind tunnel test.
    (e) Test results. If the candidate sampler meets the acceptance 
criteria for the evaluation test performed in paragraph (d)(8) of this 
section, then the candidate sampler passes this test with the 
stipulation that the sampling train be cleaned as directed by and as 
frequently as that specified by the candidate sampler's operations 
manual.


<R05>
Sec. 53.66  Test procedure: Volatility test.

    (a) Overview. This test is designed to ensure that the candidate 
method's losses due to volatility when sampling

[[Page 120]]

semi-volatile ambient aerosol will be comparable to that of a federal 
reference method sampler. This is accomplished by challenging the 
candidate sampler with a polydisperse, semi-volatile liquid aerosol in 
three distinct phases. During phase A of this test, the aerosol is 
elevated to a steady-state, test-specified mass concentration and the 
sample filters are conditioned and preweighed. In phase B, the challenge 
aerosol is simultaneously sampled by the candidate method sampler and a 
reference method sampler onto the preweighed filters for a specified 
time period. In phase C (the blow-off phase), aerosol and aerosol-vapor 
free air is sampled by the samplers for an additional time period to 
partially volatilize the aerosol on the filters. The candidate sampler 
passes the volatility test if the acceptance criteria presented in table 
F-1 of this subpart are met or exceeded.
    (b) Technical definitions. (1) Residual mass (RM) is defined as the 
weight of the filter after the blow-off phase subtracted from the 
initial weight of the filter.
    (2) Corrected residual mass (CRM) is defined as the residual mass of 
the filter from the candidate sampler multiplied by the ratio of the 
reference method flow rate to the candidate method flow rate.
    (c) Facilities and equipment required--(1) Environmental chamber. 
Because the nature of a volatile aerosol is greatly dependent upon 
environmental conditions, all phases of this test shall be conducted at 
a temperature of 22.0 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]C and a relative 
humidity of 40 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent. For this reason, it is 
strongly advised that all weighing and experimental apparatus be housed 
in an environmental chamber capable of this level of control.
    (2) Aerosol generator. The aerosol generator shall be a pressure 
nebulizer operated at 20 to 30 psig (140 to 207 kPa) to produce a 
polydisperse, semi-voltile aerosol with a mass median diameter larger 
than 1 [micro]m and smaller than 2.5 [micro]m. The nebulized liquid 
shall be A.C.S. reagent grade glycerol (C<INF>3</INF>H<INF>8</INF>O, FW 
= 92.09, CAS 56-81-5) of 99.5 percent minimum purity. For the purpose of 
this test the accepted mass median diameter is predicated on the stable 
aerosol inside the internal chamber and not on the aerosol emerging from 
the nebulizer nozzle. Aerosol monitoring and its stability are described 
in (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) Aerosol monitoring equipment. The evaporation and condensation 
dynamics of a volatile aerosol is greatly dependent upon the vapor 
pressure of the volatile component in the carrier gas. The size of an 
aerosol becomes fixed only when an equilibrium is established between 
the aerosol and the surrounding vapor; therefore, aerosol size 
measurement shall be used as a surrogate measure of this equilibrium. A 
suitable instrument with a range of 0.3 to 10 [micro]m, an accuracy of 
0.5 [micro]m, and a resolution of 0.2 [micro]m (e.g., an optical 
particle sizer, or a time-of-flight instrument) shall be used for this 
purpose. The parameter monitored for stability shall be the mass median 
instrument measured diameter (i.e. optical diameter if an optical 
particle counter is used). A stable aerosol shall be defined as an 
aerosol with a mass median diameter that has changed less than 0.25 
[micro]m over a 4 hour time period.
    (4) Internal chamber. The time required to achieve a stable aerosol 
depends upon the time during which the aerosol is resident with the 
surrounding air. This is a function of the internal volume of the 
aerosol transport system and may be facilitated by recirculating the 
challenge aerosol. A chamber with a volume of 0.5 m\3\ and a 
recirculating loop (airflow of approximately 500 cfm) is recommended for 
this purpose. In addition, a baffle is recommended to dissipate the jet 
of air that the recirculating loop can create. Furthermore, a HEPA 
filtered hole in the wall of the chamber is suggested to allow makeup 
air to enter the chamber or excess air to exit the chamber to maintain a 
system flow balance. The concentration inside the chamber shall be 
maintained at 1 mg/m\3\ <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20 percent to obtain 
consistent and significant filter loading.
    (5) Aerosol sampling manifold. A manifold shall be used to extract 
the aerosol from the area in which it is equilibrated and transport it 
to the candidate method sampler, the reference

[[Page 121]]

method sampler, and the aerosol monitor. The losses in each leg of the 
manifold shall be equivalent such that the three devices will be exposed 
to an identical aerosol.
    (6) Chamber air temperature recorders. Minimum range 15-25 [deg]C, 
certified accuracy to within 0.2 [deg]C, resolution of 0.1 [deg]C. 
Measurement shall be made at the intake to the sampling manifold and 
adjacent to the weighing location.
    (7) Chamber air relative humidity recorders. Minimum range 30 - 50 
percent, certified accuracy to within 1 percent, resolution of 0.5 
percent. Measurement shall be made at the intake to the sampling 
manifold and adjacent to the weighing location.
    (8) Clean air generation system. A source of aerosol and aerosol-
vapor free air is required for phase C of this test. This clean air 
shall be produced by filtering air through an absolute (HEPA) filter.
    (9) Balance. Minimum range 0 - 200 mg, certified accuracy to within 
10 [micro]g, resolution of 1 [micro]g.
    (d) Additional filter handling conditions--(1) Filter handling. 
Careful handling of the filter during sampling, conditioning, and 
weighing is necessary to avoid errors due to damaged filters or loss of 
collected particles from the filters. All filters must be weighed 
immediately after phase A dynamic conditioning and phase C.
    (2) Dynamic conditioning of filters. Total dynamic conditioning is 
required prior to the initial weight determined in phase A. Dynamic 
conditioning refers to pulling clean air from the clean air generation 
system through the filters. Total dynamic conditioning can be 
established by sequential filter weighing every 30 minutes following 
repetitive dynamic conditioning. The filters are considered sufficiently 
conditioned if the sequential weights are repeatable to <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>3 [micro]g.
    (3) Static charge. The following procedure is suggested for 
minimizing charge effects. Place six or more Polonium static control 
devices (PSCD) inside the microbalance weighing chamber, (MWC). Two of 
them must be placed horizontally on the floor of the MWC and the 
remainder placed vertically on the back wall of the MWC. Taping two 
PSCD's together or using double-sided tape will help to keep them from 
falling. Place the filter that is to be weighed on the horizontal PSCDs 
facing aerosol coated surface up. Close the MWC and wait 1 minute. Open 
the MWC and place the filter on the balance dish. Wait 1 minute. If the 
charges have been neutralized the weight will stabilize within 30-60 
seconds. Repeat the procedure of neutralizing charges and weighing as 
prescribed above several times (typically 2-4 times) until consecutive 
weights will differ by no more than 3 micrograms. Record the last 
measured weight and use this value for all subsequent calculations.
    (e) Test procedure--(1) Phase A - Preliminary steps. (i) Generate a 
polydisperse glycerol test aerosol.
    (ii) Introduce the aerosol into the transport system.
    (iii) Monitor the aerosol size and concentration until stability and 
level have been achieved.
    (iv) Condition the candidate method sampler and reference method 
sampler filters until total dynamic conditioning is achieved as 
specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (v) Record the dynamically conditioned weight as InitWt<INF>c</INF> 
and InitWt<INF>r</INF> where c is the candidate method sampler and r is 
the reference method sampler.
    (2) Phase B - Aerosol loading. (i) Install the dynamically 
conditioned filters into the appropriate samplers.
    (ii) Attach the samplers to the manifold.
    (iii) Operate the candidate and the reference samplers such that 
they simultaneously sample the test aerosol for 2 hours for a candidate 
sampler operating at 16.7 L/min or higher, or proportionately longer for 
a candidate sampler operating at a lower flow rate.
    (3) Phase C - Blow-off. (i) Alter the intake of the samplers to 
sample air from the clean air generation system.
    (ii) Sample clean air for one of the required blow-off time 
durations (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours).
    (iii) Remove the filters from the samplers.
    (iv) Weigh the filters immediately and record this weight, 
FinalWt<INF>c</INF> and FinalWt<INF>r</INF>, where c is the candidate

[[Page 122]]

method sampler and r is the reference method sampler.
    (v) Calculate the residual mass for the reference method sampler:
                              Equation 41a
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.135

where:

i = repetition number; and
j = blow-off time period.

    (vi) Calculate the corrected residual mass for the candidate method 
sampler as:
                              Equation 41b
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.136

where:

i = repetition number;
j = blow-off time period;
Q<INF>c</INF> = candidate method sampler flow rate, and
Q<INF>r</INF> = reference method sampler flow rate.

    (4) Repeat steps in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section 
until three repetitions have been completed for each of the required 
blow-off time durations (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours).
    (f) Calculations and analysis. (1) Perform a linear regression with 
the candidate method CRM as the dependent variable and the reference 
method RM as the independent variable.
    (2) Determine the following regression parameters: slope, intercept, 
and correlation coefficient (r).
    (g) Test results. The candidate method passes the volatility test if 
the regression parameters meet the acceptance criteria specified in 
table F-1 of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 55.1  Statutory authority and scope.

    Section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), requires the 
Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') to establish requirements to 
control air pollution from outer continental shelf (``OCS'') sources in 
order to attain and maintain Federal and State ambient air quality 
standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the 
Act. This part establishes the air pollution control requirements for 
OCS sources and the procedures for implementation and enforcement of the 
requirements, consistent with these stated objectives of section 
328(a)(1) of the Act. In implementing, enforcing and revising this rule 
and in delegating authority hereunder, the Administrator will ensure 
that there is a rational relationship to the attainment and maintenance 
of Federal and State ambient air quality standards and the requirements 
of part C of title I, and that the rule is not used for the purpose of 
preventing exploration and development of the OCS.


<R05>
Sec. 55.2  Definitions.

    Administrator means the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency.
    Corresponding Onshore Area (COA) means, with respect to any existing 
or proposed OCS source located within 25 miles of a State's seaward 
boundary, the onshore area that is geographically closest to the source 
or another onshore area that the Administrator designates as the COA, 
pursuant to Sec. 55.5 of this part.
    Delegated agency means any agency that has been delegated authority 
to implement and enforce requirements of this part by the Administrator, 
pursuant to Sec. 55.11 of this part. It can refer to a State agency, a 
local agency, or an Indian tribe, depending on the delegation status of 
the program.
    Existing source or existing OCS source shall have the meaning given 
in the applicable requirements incorporated into Sec. Sec. 55.13 and 
55.14 of this part, except that for two years following the date of 
promulgation of this part the definition given in Sec. 55.3 of this 
part shall apply for the purpose of determining the required date of 
compliance with this part.
    Exploratory source or exploratory OCS source means any OCS source 
that is a temporary operation conducted for the sole purpose of 
gathering information. This includes an operation conducted during the 
exploratory phase to determine the characteristics of the reservoir and 
formation and may involve the extraction of oil and gas.
    Modification shall have the meaning given in the applicable 
requirements incorporated into Sec. Sec. 55.13 and 55.14 of this part, 
except that for two years following the date of promulgation of this 
part the definition given in section 111(a) of the Act shall apply for 
the purpose of determining the required date of compliance with this 
part, as set forth in Sec. 55.3 of this part.
    Nearest Onshore Area (NOA) means, with respect to any existing or 
proposed OCS source, the onshore area that is geographically closest to 
that source.
    New source or new OCS source shall have the meaning given in the 
applicable requirements of Sec. Sec. 55.13 and 55.14 of this part, 
except that for two years following the date of promulgation of this 
part, the definition given in Sec. 55.3 of this part shall apply for 
the purpose of determining the required date of compliance with this 
part.
    OCS source means any equipment, activity, or facility which:
    (1) Emits or has the potential to emit any air pollutant;

[[Page 129]]

    (2) Is regulated or authorized under the Outer Continental Shelf 
Lands Act (``OCSLA'') (43 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 et seq.); and
    (3) Is located on the OCS or in or on waters above the OCS.
    This definition shall include vessels only when they are:
    (1) Permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed and erected 
thereon and used for the purpose of exploring, developing or producing 
resources therefrom, within the meaning of section 4(a)(1) of OCSLA (43 
U.S.C. Sec. 1331 et seq.); or
    (2) Physically attached to an OCS facility, in which case only the 
stationary sources aspects of the vessels will be regulated.
    Onshore area means a coastal area designated as an attainment, 
nonattainment, or unclassifiable area by EPA in accordance with section 
107 of the Act. If the boundaries of an area designated pursuant to 
section 107 of the Act do not coincide with the boundaries of a single 
onshore air pollution control agency, then onshore area shall mean a 
coastal area defined by the jurisdictional boundaries of an air 
pollution control agency.
    Outer continental shelf shall have the meaning provided by section 2 
of the OCSLA (43 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 et seq.).
    Potential emissions means the maximum emissions of a pollutant from 
an OCS source operating at its design capacity. Any physical or 
operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit a pollutant, 
including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of 
operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or 
processed, shall be treated as a limit on the design capacity of the 
source if the limitation is federally enforceable. Pursuant to section 
328 of the Act, emissions from vessels servicing or associated with an 
OCS source shall be considered direct emissions from such a source while 
at the source, and while enroute to or from the source when within 25 
miles of the source, and shall be included in the ``potential to emit'' 
for an OCS source. This definition does not alter or affect the use of 
this term for any other purposes under Sec. Sec. 55.13 or 55.14 of this 
part, except that vessel emissions must be included in the ``potential 
to emit'' as used in Sec. Sec. 55.13 and 55.14 of this part.
    Residual emissions means the difference in emissions from an OCS 
source if it applies the control requirements(s) imposed pursuant to 
Sec. 55.13 or Sec. 55,14 of this part and emissions from that source 
if it applies a substitute control requirement pursuant to an exemption 
granted under Sec. 55.7 of this part.
    State means the State air pollution control agency that would be the 
permitting authority, a local air pollution permitting agency, or 
certain Indian tribes which can be the permitting authority for areas 
within their jurisdiction. State may also be used in the geographic 
sense to refer to a State, the NOA, or the COA.

<R05>
Sec. 55.5  Corresponding onshore area designation.

    (a) Proposed exploratory sources. The NOA shall be the COA for 
exploratory sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward 
boundaries. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (f) of this section are not 
applicable to these sources.
    (b) Requests for designation. (1) The chief executive officer of the 
air pollution control agency of an area that believes it has more 
stringent air pollution control requirements than the NOA for a proposed 
OCS source, may submit a request to be designated as the COA to the 
Administrator and at the same time shall send copies of the request to 
the chief executive officer of the NOA and to the proposed source. The 
request must be received by the Administrator within 60 days of the 
receipt of the NOI. If no requests are received by the Administrator 
within 60 days of the receipt of the NOI, the NOA will become the 
designated COA without further action.
    (2) No later than 90 days after the receipt of the NOI, a 
demonstration must be received by the Administrator showing that:
    (i) The area has more stringent requirements with respect to the 
control and abatement of air pollution than the NOA;
    (ii) The emissions from the source are or would be transported to 
the requesting area; and
    (iii) The transported emissions would affect the requesting area's 
efforts to attain or maintain a Federal or State ambient air quality 
standard or to comply with the requirements of part C of title I of the 
Act, taking into account the effect of air pollution control 
requirements that would be imposed if the NOA were designated as the 
COA.
    (c) Determination by the Administrator. (1) If no demonstrations are 
received by

[[Page 131]]

the Administrator within 90 days of the receipt of the NOI, the NOA will 
become the designated COA without further action.
    (2) If one or more demonstrations are received, the Administrator 
will issue a preliminary designation of the COA within 150 days of the 
receipt of the NOI, which shall be followed by a 30 day public comment 
period, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) The Administrator will designate the COA for a specific source 
within 240 days of the receipt of the NOI.
    (4) When the Administrator designates a more stringent area as the 
COA with respect to a specific OCS source, the delegated agency in the 
COA will exercise all delegated authority. If there is no delegated 
agency in the COA, then EPA will issue the permit and implement and 
enforce the requirements of this part. The Administrator may retain 
authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of this part 
if the NOA and the COA are in different States.
    (5) The Administrator shall designate the COA for each source only 
once in the source's lifetime.
    (d) Offset requirements. Offsets shall be obtained based on the 
applicable requirements of the COA, as set forth in Sec. Sec. 55.13 and 
55.14 of this part.
    (e) Authority to designate the COA. The authority to designate the 
COA for any OCS source shall not be delegated to a State or local 
agency, but shall be retained by the Administrator.
    (f) Administrative procedures and public participation. The 
Administrator will use the following public notice and comment 
procedures for processing a request for COA designation under this 
section:
    (1) Within 150 days from receipt of an NOI, if one or more 
demonstrations are received, the Administrator shall make a preliminary 
determination of the COA and shall:
    (i) Make available, in at least one location in the NOA and in the 
area requesting COA designation, a copy of all materials submitted by 
the requester, a copy of the Administrator's preliminary determination, 
and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered by the 
Administrator in making the preliminary determination; and
    (ii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the NOA and the area requesting COA designation, 
of a 30-day opportunity for written public comment on the available 
information and the Administrator's preliminary COA designation.
    (2) A copy of the notice required pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) 
of this section shall be sent to the requester, the affected source, 
each person from whom a written request of such notice has been 
received, and the following officials and agencies having jurisdiction 
over the COA and NOA: State and local air pollution control agencies, 
the chief executive of the city and county, the Federal Land Manager of 
potentially affected Class I areas, and any Indian governing body whose 
lands may be affected by emissions from the OCS source.
    (3) Public comments received in writing within 30 days after the 
date the public notice is made available will be considered by the 
Administrator in making the final decision on the request. All comments 
will be made available for public inspection.
    (4) The Administrator will make a final COA designation within 60 
days after the close of the public comment period. The Administrator 
will notify, in writing, the requester and each person who has requested 
notice of the final action and will set forth the reasons for the 
determination. Such notification will be made available for public 
inspection.

Sec. 55.7  Exemptions.

    (a) Authority and criteria. The Administrator or the delegated 
agency may exempt a source from a control technology requirement of this 
part if the Administrator or the delegated agency finds that compliance 
with the control technology requirement is technically infeasible or 
will cause an unreasonable threat to health and safety.
    (b) Request for an exemption--(1) Permit application required. An 
applicant shall submit a request for an exemption from a control 
technology requirement at the same time as the applicant submits a 
preconstruction or operating permit application to the Administrator or 
delegated agency.
    (2) No permit application required. If no permit or permit 
modification is required, a request for an exemption must be received by 
the Administrator or delegated agency within 60 days from the date the 
control technology requirement is promulgated by EPA.
    (3) Compliance plan. An existing source that submits a compliance 
plan in accordance with Sec. 55.6(b) of this part shall submit all 
requests for exemptions at the same time as the compliance plan. For the 
purpose of applying Sec. 55.7 of this part, a request submitted with a 
compliance plan shall be treated in the same manner as a request that 
does not require a permit application.
    (4) Content of request. (i) The request shall include information 
that demonstrates that compliance with a control technology requirement 
of this part would be technically infeasible or would cause an 
unreasonable threat to health and safety.
    (ii) The request shall include a proposed substitute requirement(s) 
as close in stringency to the original requirement as possible.
    (iii) The request shall include an estimate of emission reductions 
that would be achieved by compliance with the original requirement, an 
estimate of emission reductions that would be achieved by compliance 
with the proposed substitute requirement(s) and an estimate of residual 
emissions.
    (iv) The request shall identify emission reductions of a sufficient 
quantity to offset the estimated residual emissions. Sources located 
beyond 25 miles from States' seaward boundaries shall consult with the 
Administrator to identify suitable emission reductions.
    (c) Consultation requirement. If the authority to grant or deny 
exemptions has been delegated, the delegated agency shall consult with 
the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of Interior and 
the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether the exemption will be granted 
or denied.
    (1) The delegated agency shall transmit to the Administrator 
(through the Regional Office), the Minerals Management Service, and the 
U.S. Coast Guard, a copy of the permit application, or the request if no 
permit is required, within 5 days of its receipt.
    (2) Consensus. If the delegated agency, the Minerals Management 
Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard reach a consensus decision on the 
request within 90 days from the date the delegated agency received the 
request, the delegated agency may issue a preliminary determination in 
accordance with the applicable requirements of paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (3) No consensus. If the delegated agency, the Minerals Management 
Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard do

[[Page 136]]

not reach a consensus decision within 90 days from the date the 
delegated agency received the request, the request shall automatically 
be referred to the Administrator who will process the referral in 
accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The delegated agency 
shall transmit to the Administrator, within 91 days of its receipt, the 
request and all materials submitted with the request, such as the permit 
application or the compliance plan, and any other information considered 
or developed during the consultation process.
    (4) If a request is referred to the Administrator and the delegated 
agency issues a preliminary determination on a permit application before 
the Administrator issues a final decision on the exemption, the 
delegated agency shall include a notice of the opportunity to comment on 
the Administrator's preliminary determination in accordance with the 
procedures of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (5) The Administrator's final decision on a request that has been 
referred pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall be incorporated 
into the final permit issued by the delegated agency. If no permit is 
required, the Administrator's final decision on the request shall be 
implemented and enforced by the delegated agency.
    (d) Preliminary determination. The Administrator or delegated agency 
shall issue a preliminary determination in accordance with paragraph (f) 
of this section. A preliminary determination shall propose to grant or 
deny the request for exemption. A preliminary determination to grant the 
request shall include proposed substitute control requirements and 
offsets necessary to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (e) Grant of exemption. (1) The source shall comply with a 
substitute requirement(s), equal to or as close in stringency to the 
original requirement as possible, as determined by the Administrator or 
delegated agency.
    (2) An OCS source located within 25 miles of States' seaward 
boundaries shall offset residual emissions resulting from the grant of 
an exemption request in accordance with the requirements of the Act and 
the regulations thereunder. The source shall obtain offsets in 
accordance with the applicable requirements as follows:
    (i) If offsets are required in the COA, a new source shall offset 
residual emissions in the same manner as all other new source emissions 
in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 55.5(d) of this part.
    (ii) If offsets are not required in the COA, a new source shall 
comply with an offset ratio of 1:1.
    (iii) An existing OCS source shall comply with an offset at a ratio 
of 1:1.
    (3) An OCS source located beyond 25 miles from States' seaward 
boundaries shall obtain emission reductions at a ratio determined by the 
Administrator to be adequate to protect State and Federal ambient air 
quality standards and to comply with part C of title I of the Act.
    (f) Administrative procedures and public participation--(1) Request 
submitted with a permit application. If a request is submitted with a 
permit application, the request shall be considered part of the permit 
application and shall be processed accordingly for the purpose of 
administrative procedures and public notice and comment requirements. 
The Administrator shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 124 
and the requirements set forth at Sec. 55.6 of this part. If the 
Administrator has delegated authority to a State, the delegated agency 
shall use its own procedures as deemed adequate by the Administrator in 
accordance with Sec. 55.11 of this part. These procedures must provide 
for public notice and comment on the preliminary determination.
    (2) Request submitted without a permit or with a compliance plan. If 
a permit is not required, the Administrator or the delegated agency 
shall issue a preliminary determination within 90 days from the date the 
request was received, and shall use the procedures set forth at 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section for processing a request.

Administrator:
    (i) Issue a preliminary determination to grant or deny the request. 
A preliminary determination by the Administrator to deny a request shall 
be considered a final decision and will be accompanied by the reasons 
for the decision. As such, it is not subject to any further public 
notice, comment, or hearings. Written notice of the denial shall be 
given to the requester.
    (ii) Make available, in at least one location in the COA and NOA, a 
copy of all materials submitted by the requester, a copy of the 
preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other materials, if 
any, considered in making the preliminary determination.
    (iii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper 
of general circulation in the COA and NOA, of a 30-day opportunity for 
written public comment on the information submitted by the owner or 
operator and on the preliminary determination.
    (iv) Send a copy of the notice required pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(4)(iii) of this section to the requester, the affected source, each 
person from whom a written request of such notice has been received, and 
the following officials and agencies having jurisdiction over the COA 
and NOA: State and local air pollution control agencies, the chief 
executive of the city and county, the Federal Land Manager of 
potentially affected Class I areas, and any Indian governing body whose 
lands may be affected by emissions from the OCS source.
    (v) Consider written public comments received within 30 days after 
the date the public notice is made available when making the final 
decision on the request. All comments will be made available for public 
inspection. At the time that any final decision is issued, the 
Administrator or delegated agency will issue a response to comments.
    (vi) Make a final decision on the request within 30 days after the 
close of the public comment period. The Administrator or the delegated 
agency will notify, in writing, the applicant and each person who has 
submitted written comments, or from whom a written request of such 
notice has been received, of the final decision and will set forth the 
reasons. Such notification will be made available for public inspection.
    (5) Within 30 days after the final decision has been made on a 
request, the requester, or any person who filed comments on the 
preliminary determination, may petition the Administrator to review any 
aspect of the decision. Any person who failed to file comments on the 
preliminary decision may petition for administrative review only on the 
changes from the preliminary to the final determination.

<R05>
Sec. 55.9  Enforcement.

    (a) OCS sources shall comply with all requirements of this part and 
all permits issued pursuant to this part. Failure to do so shall be 
considered a violation of section 111(e) of the Act.
    (b) All enforcement provisions of the Act, including, but not 
limited to, the provisions of sections 113, 114, 120, 303 and 304 of the 
Act, shall apply to OCS sources.
    (c) If a facility is ordered to cease operation of any piece of 
equipment due to enforcement action taken by EPA or a delegated agency 
pursuant to this part, the shutdown will be coordinated by the enforcing 
agency with the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Coast Guard to 
assure that the shutdown will proceed in a safe manner. No shutdown 
action will occur until after consultation with these agencies, but in 
no case will initiation of the shutdown be delayed by more than 24 
hours.


<R05>
Sec. 55.10  Fees.

    (a) OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward 
boundaries. (1) The EPA will calculate and collect operating permit fees 
from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 71.
    (2) EPA will collect all other fees from OCS sources calculated in 
accordance with the fee requirements imposed in the COA if the fees are 
based on regulatory objectives, such as discouraging emissions. If the 
fee requirements are based on cost recovery objectives, however, EPA 
will adjust the fees to reflect the costs to EPA to issue permits and 
administer the permit program.
    (3) Upon delegation, the delegated agency will collect fees from OCS 
sources calculated in accordance with the fee requirements imposed in 
the COA. Upon delegation of authority to implement and enforce any 
portion of this part, EPA will cease to collect fees imposed in 
conjunction with that portion.
    (b) The OCS sources located beyond 25 miles of States' seaward 
boundaries. The EPA will calculate and collect operating permit fees 
from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 71.

<R05>
Sec. 55.11  Delegation.

    (a) The Governor or the Governor's designee of any State adjacent to 
an OCS source subject to the requirements of this part may submit a 
request, purusant to section 328(a)(3) of the Act, to the Administrator 
for the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of this OCS 
program: Within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary; and/or Beyond 
25 miles of the State's seaward boundary. Authority to implement and 
enforce Sec. Sec. 55.5, 55.11, and 55.12 of this part will not be 
delegated.
    (b) The Administrator will delegate implementation and enforcement 
authority to a State if the State has an adjacent OCS source and the 
Administrator determines that the State's regulations are adequate, 
including a demonstration by the State that the State has:
    (1) Adopted the appropriate portions of this part into State law;
    (2) Adequate authority under State law to implement and enforce the 
requirements of this part. A letter from the State Attorney General 
shall be required stating that the requesting agency has such authority;
    (3) Adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of 
this part; and
    (4) Adequate administrative procedures to implement and enforce the 
requirements of this part, including public notice and comment 
procedures.
    (c) The Administrator will notify in writing the Governor or the 
Governor's designee of the Administrator's final action on a request for 
delegation within 6 months of the receipt of the request.
    (d) If the Administrator finds that the State regulations are 
adequate, the Administrator will authorize the State to implement and 
enforce the OCS requirements under State law. If the Administrator finds 
that only part of the State regulations are adequate, he will authorize 
the State to implement and enforce only that portion of this part.
    (e) Upon delegation, a State may use any authority it possesses 
under State

[[Page 139]]

law to enforce any permit condition or any other requirement of this 
part for which the agency has delegated authority under this part. A 
State may use any authority it possesses under State law to require 
monitoring and reporting and to conduct inspections.
    (f) Nothing in this part shall prohibit the Administrator from 
enforcing any requirement of this part.
    (g) The Administrator will withdraw a delegation of any authority to 
implement and enforce any or all of this part if the Administrator 
determines that: (1) The requirements of this part are not being 
adequately implemented or enforced by the delegated agency, or (2) The 
delegated agency no longer has adequate regulations as required by Sec. 
55.11(b) of this part.
    (h) Sharing of information. Any information obtained or used in the 
administration of a delegated program shall be made available to EPA 
upon request without restriction. If the information has been submitted 
to the delegated agency under a claim of confidentiality, the delegated 
agency must notify the source of this obligation and submit that claim 
to EPA. Any information obtained from a delegated agency accompanied by 
a claim of confidentiality will be treated in accordance with the 
requirements of 40 CFR part 2.
    (i) Grant of exemptions. A decision by a delegated agency to grant 
or deny an exemption request may be appealed to the Administrator in 
accordance with Sec. 55.7 of this part.
    (j) Delegated authority. The delegated agency in the COA for sources 
located within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary or the delegated 
agency in the NOA for sources located beyond 25 miles of the State's 
seaward boundary will exercise all delegated authority. If there is no 
delegated agency in the COA for sources located within 25 miles of the 
State's seaward boundary, or in the NOA for sources located beyond 25 
miles of the State's seaward boundary, the EPA will issue the permit and 
implement and enforce the requirements of this part. For sources located 
within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, the Administrator may 
retain the authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of 
this part if the NOA and COA are in different States.

Sec. 55.12  Consistency updates.

    (a) The Administrator will update this part as necessary to maintain 
consistency with the regulations of onshore areas in order to attain and 
maintain Federal and State ambient standards and comply with part C of 
title I of the Act.
    (b) Where an OCS activity is occurring within 25 miles of a State 
seaward boundary, consistency reviews will occur at least annually. In 
addition, in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, 
consistency reviews will occur upon receipt of an NOI and when a State 
or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered for incorporation 
by reference in this part 55.
    (1) Upon initiation of a consistency review, the Administrator will 
evaluate the requirements of part 55 to determine whether they are 
consistent with the current onshore requirements.
    (2) If the Administrator finds that part 55 is inconsistent with the 
requirements in effect in the onshore area, EPA will conduct a notice 
and comment rulemaking to update part 55 accordingly.
    (c) Consistency reviews triggered by receipt of an NOI. Upon receipt 
of an NOI, the Administrator will initiate a consistency review of 
regulations in the onshore area.
    (1) If the NOI is submitted by a source for which the COA has 
previously been assigned, EPA will publish a proposed consistency update 
in the Federal Register no later than 60 days after the receipt of the 
NOI, if an update is deemed necessary by the Administrator:
    (2) If the NOI is submitted by a source requiring a COA designation, 
EPA will publish a proposed consistency update in the Federal Register, 
if an update is deemed necessary by the Administrator:
    (i) No later than 75 days after receipt of the NOI if no adjacent 
areas submit a request for COA designation and the NOA becomes the COA 
by default, or
    (ii) No later than 105 days after receipt of the NOI if an adjacent 
area

[[Page 140]]

submits a request to be designated as COA but fails to submit the 
required demonstration within 90 days of receipt of the NOI, or
    (iii) No later than 15 days after the date of the final COA 
determination if one or more demonstrations are received.
    (d) Consistency reviews triggered by State and local air pollution 
control agencies submitting rules directly to EPA for inclusion into 
part 55. (1) EPA will propose in the Federal Register to approve 
applicable rules submitted by State or local regulatory agencies for 
incorporation by reference into Sec. 55.14 of this part by the end of 
the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the submittal is 
received by EPA.
    (2) State and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 must be 
rationally related to the attainment and maintenance of Federal or State 
ambient air quality standards or to the requirements of part C of title 
I of the Act. The submittal must be legible and unmarked, with the 
adoption date and the name of the agency on each page, and must be 
accompanied by proof of adoption.
    (e) No rule or regulation that EPA finds to be arbitrary or 
capricious will be incorporated into this part.
    (f) A source may not submit a complete permit application until any 
update the Administrator deems necessary to make part 55 consistent with 
the COA's rules has been proposed.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 57.101  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Applicability of the regulations. The regulations in subparts A 
through H govern:
    (1) The eligibility of smelters for a Primary Nonferrous Smelter 
Order (NSO) under section 119 of the Clean Air Act;
    (2) The procedures through which an NSO can be approved or issued by 
EPA; and
    (3) The minimum contents of each NSO required for EPA issuance or 
approval under section 119. Subpart I et seq., will contain NSOs in 
effect for individual smelters.
    (b) State authority to adopt more stringent requirements. Nothing in 
this part shall preclude a State from imposing more stringent 
requirements, as provided by section 116 of the Clean Air Act.


<R05>
Sec. 57.102  Eligibility.

    (a) A primary copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, or other nonferrous 
smelter is eligible for an NSO if it meets the following conditions:
    (1) The smelter was in existence and operating on August 7, 1977;
    (2) The smelter is subject to an approved or promulgated sulfur 
dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) State Implementation Plan (SIP) emission 
limitation which is adequate to ensure that National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS) for SO<INF>2</INF> are achieved without the use of any 
unauthorized dispersion techniques; and
    (3) The Administrator determines, based on a showing by the smelter 
owner, that no means of emission limitation applicable to the smelter 
which would enable it to comply with its SIP stack emission limitation 
for SO<INF>2</INF> has been adequately demonstrated to be reasonably 
available (taking into account the cost of compliance, nonair quality 
health and environmental impact, and energy considerations) in 
accordance with Sec. 57.201(d)(1).
    (b) For the purposes of these regulations:
    (1) The following means of emission limitation shall be considered 
adequately demonstrated for nonferrous smelters. (Taking into account 
nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy 
considerations, but not the cost of compliance).
    (i) Retrofit control technologies. (A) Sulfuric acid plant in 
conjunction with an adequately demonstrated replacement technology or 
process modification;
    (B) Magnesium oxide (concentration) scrubbing;
    (C) Lime/limestone scrubbing; and
    (D) Ammonia scrubbing.
    (ii) Replacement or process modifications. (A) Flash smelting;
    (B) Oxygen enrichment;
    (C) Supplemental sulfur burning in conjunction with acid plant;
    (D) Electric Furnace;
    (E) Noranda process;
    (F) Fluid bed roaster;
    (G) Continuous smelting (Mitsubishi) process; and
    (H) Strong stream/weak stream gas blending.
    (2) Each adequately demonstrated means of emission limitation which 
would enable a smelter to comply with its SIP emission limitation for 
SO<INF>2</INF> shall be considered applicable to the smelter unless the 
smelter operator demonstrates that the use of a particular system at 
that smelter is technically unreasonable, for reasons specific to that 
site.
    (3) An applicable means of emission limitation which would enable a 
smelter to comply with its SIP emission limitation for SO<INF>2</INF> 
shall be considered adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available 
to the smelter (taking into account the cost of compliance) if the

[[Page 155]]

information submitted under Sec. Sec. 57.107(a) and 57.203(b) (plus any 
necessary supplemental information) shows, according to the criteria, 
procedures, and tests contained in appendix A to this part and in 
accordance with Sec. 57.201(d)(1), that both of the following two tests 
are met.
    (i) The rate of return test. The present value of the smelter's 
future net cash flow (during and after investment in constant control 
technology) is more than book value of the smelter's net investment in 
constant dollars.
    (ii) The profit protection test. The constant control technology 
expenditure reduces the present value of the smelter's forecast pretax 
profits by less than 50%.
    (c) When applying for an NSO, a smelter must establish, for purposes 
of applying the financial eligibility tests, which adequately 
demonstrated constant control technology applicable to that smelter is 
the most economically feasible for use at that smelter.

hereafter amended.
    (g) Ambient air quality refers only to concentrations of sulfur 
dioxide in the ambient air, unless otherwise specified.
    (h) An approved measure refers to one contained in an NSO which is 
in effect.
    (i) Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation means the 
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency.
    (j) Constant controls, control technology, and continuous emission 
reduction technology mean systems which limit the quantity, rate, or 
concentration, excluding the use of dilution, and emissions of air 
pollutants on a continuous basis.
    (k) Effective date of an NSO means the effective date listed in the 
Federal Register publication of EPA's issuance or approval of an NSO.
    (l) EPA and the Agency means the Administrator of the U.S.

atmosphere other than from a stack.
    (n) Issuance of an NSO means the final transmittal of the NSO 
pursuant to Sec. 57.107(a) by an issuing agency (other than EPA) to EPA 
for approval, or the publication of an NSO issued by EPA in the Federal 
Register.
    (o) Issuing agency, unless otherwise specifically indicated, means 
the State or local air pollution control agency to which a smelter's 
owner has applied for an NSO, or which has issued the NSO, or EPA, when 
the NSO application has been made to EPA. Any showings or demonstrations 
required to be made under this part to the issuing agency, when not EPA, 
are subject to independent determinations by EPA.
    (p) Malfunction means any unanticipated and unavoidable failure of 
air pollution control equipment or process equipment or of a process to 
operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused entirely 
or in part by poor design, poor maintenance, careless operation, or any

the same meaning given them by the Act.

[50 FR 6448, Feb. 15, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 5328, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 57.104  Amendment of the NSO.

    An NSO shall be amended whenever necessary for compliance with the 
requirements and purposes of this part.
    (a)(1) Issuance of amendment. A State or local issuing agency may 
issue an amendment of any NSO it has issued. Any amendment issued by a 
State or local issuing agency shall be subject to approval by EPA to the 
same extent as was the original NSO. Any smelter owner may apply to the 
agency which originally issued its NSO for an amendment of the NSO at 
any time. Such an application shall be accompanied by whatever 
documentation is required by that agency (or EPA) to support the 
requested amendment.
    (2)(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, amendments to SIP compliance schedule interim compliance dates 
in State-issued NSO's need not be submitted for EPA approval if the 
amendment does not delay the interim date by more than three months from 
the date as approved by the Administrator and if the final compliance 
date is unchanged. Delays longer than 3 months shall be handled 
according to the provisions of Sec. 57.104(a)(1).
    (ii) Changes made in accordance with this subparagraph may be 
effective immediately but must be submitted to EPA within seven days. 
EPA will give public notice of receipt of such changes by publication of 
a Notice in the Federal Register.
    (3) In any case in which the issuing agency fails to issue an 
amendment necessary for compliance with the requirements and purposes of 
this part, EPA may, after first giving the issuing Agency notice, issue 
such amendment.
    (b) Revision of SCS Manual. Operation in accordance with the revised 
provisions of an SCS operational manual (see Sec. 57.402(e)) shall not 
be considered a violation of an NSO while the application for approval 
of those revisions as NSO amendments is pending before the issuing 
agency (or EPA) for approval: Provided, that:
    (1) No violations of NAAQS occur in the smelter's Designated 
Liability Area during that time; and
    (2) The smelter operator has not been informed by the issuing agency 
or EPA that its application is not adequately

[[Page 157]]

documented, unless such deficiency has been remedied promptly.
    (c) Notice and opportunity for hearing. Notice and opportunity for 
public hearing shall be provided before issuance of all major 
amendments.


<R05>
Sec. 57.105  Submittal of required plans, proposals, and reports.

    (a) The failure of a smelter owner to submit any plan, report, 
document or proposal as required by its NSO or by this part shall 
constitute a violation of its NSO.
    (b) If the Administrator determines that a nonferrous smelter is in 
violation of a requirement contained in an NSO approved under these 
regulations, the Administrator shall, as provided by section 119(f) of 
the Act:
    (1) Enforce such requirement under section 113 (a), (b), or (c) of 
the Act;
    (2) Revoke the order after notice and opportunity for hearing;
    (3) Give notice of noncompliance and commence action under section 
120 of the act; or
    (4) Take any appropriate combinations of these actions.
    (c) Under section 304 of the Act, any person may commence a civil 
action against an owner or operator of a smelter which is alleged to be 
in violation or any order approved under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 57.106  Expiration date.

    Each NSO shall state its expiration date. No NSO issued under this 
regulation shall expire later than January 1, 1988.


<R05>
Sec. 57.107  The State or local agency's transmittal to EPA.

    (a) Content and bases of the State or local agency's NSO. Issuance 
of an NSO by a State or local agency shall be completed by the issuing 
agency's transmittal to the appropriate EPA Regional Office of:
    (1) The text of the NSO;
    (2) The application submitted by the smelter owner, except for 
appendix A to this part, all correspondence between the issuing agency 
and the applicant relating to the NSO, and any material submitted in 
support of the application;
    (3) A concise statement of the State or local agency's findings and 
their bases; and
    (4) All documentation or analyses prepared by or for the issuing 
agency in support of the NSO.
    (b) The State or local agency's enforcement plan. The transmittal 
under paragraph (a) of this section shall be accompanied by a 
description of the issuing agency's plans for monitoring compliance with 
and enforcement of the NSO. The transmittal shall also include a 
description of the resources which will be used to implement those 
plans. If the enforcement plans appear inadequate, EPA may require that 
the NSO be modified such that the NSO will be adequately enforced.


<R05>
Sec. 57.108  Comparable existing SIP provisions.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an NSO may contain 
provisions to which the affected smelter is subject under the applicable 
EPA-approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide in lieu 
of the corresponding provisions which would otherwise be required under 
this part if the Administrator determines that those SIP provisions are 
substantially equivalent to the corresponding NSO provisions which would 
otherwise be required, and if the Administrator determines that the 
smelter is in substantial compliance with those SIP provisions. For the 
purposes of this section, provisions to which the affected smelter is 
subject under the applicable EPA-approved State Implementation Plan are 
those which became effective before the smelter owner applied for the 
NSO.


<R05>
Sec. 57.109  Maintenance of pay.

    The Administrator will not approve or issue an NSO for any smelter 
unless he has approved or promulgated SIP provisions which are 
applicable to the smelter and which satisfy the requirements of section 
110(a)(6) of the Clean Air Act.


<R05>
Sec. 57.110  Reimbursement of State or local agency.

    As a condition of issuing an NSO, any issuing agency may require the 
smelter operator to pay a fee to the State or

[[Page 158]]

local agency sufficient to defray the issuing agency's expenses in 
issuing and enforcing the NSO.


<R05>
Sec. 57.111  Severability of provisions.

    The provisions promulgated in this part and the various applications 
thereof are distinct and severable. If any provision of this part or the 
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such 
invalidity shall not affect other provisions, or the application of such 
provisions to other persons or circumstances, which can be given effect 
without the invalid provision of application.


<R04>
              Subpart B_The Application and the NSO Process


<R05>
Sec. 57.201  Where to apply.

    Any eligible smelter may apply for an NSO to the appropriate EPA 
Regional Office or to the appropriate State or local air pollution 
control agency.
    (a) When application is made to EPA, all parts of the application 
required to be submitted under this subpart shall be sent directly to 
the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341), U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., 
Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Confidential Information Unit. In 
addition, the smelter owner shall send a copy of the application, except 
that part required to be submitted under Sec. 57.203(b) (eligibility), 
directly to the appropriate EPA Regional Office.
    (b) When application is made to the appropriate State or local 
agency, the smelter owner shall submit one complete copy of all parts of 
the application required to be submitted under this subpart to that 
agency, in addition to the application requirements contained in 
paragraph (a) of this section. If the smelter owner is requesting an 
advance eligibility determination pursuant to Sec. 57.203(b), such 
request must be made in writing and shall accompany the copy of the 
application being sent to the Director of the Stationary Source 
Compliance Division of the Environmental Protection Agency.
    (c) If the smelter owner is requesting a waiver of the interim 
constant control requirement of Sec. 57.301, such request must be sent 
directly to the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division, at the 
time of application, in accordance with Sec. 57.802.
    (d) The NSO Process. (1) A smelter desiring an NSO shall apply for 
an NSO by submitting an application under subpart B including the 
financial information required in appendix A and including the 
information necessary to make the determinations required by this 
subparagraph and Sec. 57.201(d)(2). The issuing agency shall analyze 
the financial information according to the financial eligibility test 
prescribed by subpart A and described in appendix A. The issuing Agency 
shall then determine whether the smelter is able to comply with its SIP 
on or before the date required in the SIP by installing adequately 
demonstrated technology which is reasonably available. See also Sec. 
57.102(a)(3). If the test demonstrates that adequately demonstrated 
technology is not reasonably available to the smelter to allow it to 
comply with the SIP by the required compliance date, the smelter is 
eligible for an NSO.
    (2)(i) If the smelter is determined to be eligible for an NSO under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the issuing Agency shall apply the 
appendix A financial eligibility tests again before issuing an NSO in 
order to determine if the smelter can comply with its SIP requirements 
on or before January 1, 1988 by installing adequately demonstrated 
technology which is reasonably available.
    (ii) If application of the tests shows that the smelter could comply 
by or before January 1, 1988, the issuing agency shall notify the 
smelter of this determination, and shall not issue an NSO to the smelter 
unless the NSO contains a SIP compliance schedule meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 57.705. Such a compliance schedule must provide 
for compliance with the smelter's SO<INF>2</INF> SIP as expeditiously as 
practicable and in no case later than January 1, 1988. A smelter must 
submit to the issuing agency information necessary to determine a 
compliance schedule meeting the requirements of Sec. 57.705. This 
information shall be submitted by a smelter within thirty days after the 
smelter is notified by the issuing agency that a SIP compliance schedule 
is

[[Page 159]]

required. The Administrator may consider an NSO application to be 
withdrawn for SIP enforcement purposes if a smelter fails to submit such 
information within the time required under this paragraph.
    (iii) If no adequately demonstrated technology is found to be 
reasonably available to enable a smelter to comply by January 1, 1988, 
it would be excused from the compliance schedule requirement in Sec. 
57.201(d)(2)(ii), but it would be subject to reevaluation of its ability 
to comply by that date at any time during the term of the NSO. (See 
Sec. 57.201(d)(3)).
    (3) At any time during the term of an NSO which does not contain a 
SIP compliance schedule, EPA or the issuing agency may reevaluate the 
availability of technology to the smelter. If EPA or the issuing agency 
determines that adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably 
available to permit the smelter to comply with its SIP by or before 
January 1, 1988, the NSO shall be amended within 3 months time after 
such determination. The amendment shall require compliance with all SIP 
requirements by or before January 1, 1988, and shall include a 
compliance schedule meeting the requirements of Sec. 57.705. The 
determination that adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably 
available shall be made by reapplying the same appendix A financial 
eligibility tests required by subpart B, updated by economic data 
reflecting current operating conditions and currently demonstrated 
control technology. Any such determination and amendment shall be 
governed by the provisions of this part and section 119 of the Clean Air 
Act.
    (4) Notice and opportunity for public hearing in accordance with 
section 119 of the Clean Air Act must be provided before issuance of any 
NSO.
    (e) A smelter that does not have any constant SO<INF>2</INF> 
controls or whose existing constant SO<INF>2</INF> controls when in full 
operation and optimally maintained are not sufficient to treat all 
strong SO<INF>2</INF> streams may apply for a waiver of the requirements 
of subpart C to install interim constant controls by submitting an 
application under subpart H. A waiver may be granted only with respect 
to the requirement to eliminate bypass of constant controls through the 
installation of new constant control equipment, not with respect to the 
requirements for optimum maintenance and operation of existing 
equipment. EPA shall then determine the smelter's ability to afford 
installation of the required additional interim constant SO<INF>2</INF> 
control equipment at the smelter based on financial eligibility 
information analyzed according to the financial test prescribed in 
appendix A. A waiver of the requirement for additional interim constant 
controls will be granted if EPA determines in accordance with the 
procedures of subpart H that imposition of this requirement would 
necessitate closure of the smelter for at least one year.


<R05>
Sec. 57.202  How to apply.

    (a) Letter of intent. To initiate an application for an NSO, the 
owner or operator of a smelter shall send a letter of intent to an 
appropriate air pollution control agency. The letter of intent shall 
contain a statement of the owner's intent to apply for an NSO, and an 
agreement to provide any information required under this part. The 
letter of intent shall be signed by a corporate official authorized to 
make such commitments. Upon receipt of any letter of intent by the 
issuing agency, the SIP emission limitation for sulfur dioxide, as to 
that applicant, shall be deemed suspended for 60 days. The 60 day 
suspension may be extended for good cause at the discretion of the 
Administrator.
    (b) Complete application. (1) Within the period referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the smelter owner shall submit its 
completed application pursuant to Sec. 57.201. Receipt of all parts of 
a substantially complete application postmarked within the original or 
extended application period shall be deemed to continue the suspension 
of the SIP emission limitation for SO<INF>2</INF> until the issuing 
agency issues or declines to issue an NSO. This suspension shall in all 
cases terminate, however, 90 days after receipt of the substantially 
completed application, unless extended for good cause at the discretion 
of the Administrator. If, in the Administrator's judgment, good faith 
effort

[[Page 160]]

has been made to submit a complete application, additional time may be 
granted to allow for correction of minor deficiencies.
    (2) If an issuing agency transmits an NSO to EPA for approval before 
the expiration of the suspension of the Federal SIP emission limitation, 
the suspension shall continue until EPA approves or disapproves the NSO.


<R05>

may modify these proposals in any way it deems necessary in order to 
comply with the requirements of this part.
    (e) A smelter may submit as part of its application, information 
necessary to determine any SIP compliance schedule which might be 
required under Sec. 57.201(d)(2).
    (f) Additional information. The smelter owner shall designate in its 
application a corporate officer responsible and authorized to supply 
supplemental technical and economic information and explanations as 
required by the issuing agency during the formulation of the NSO.

<R05>
Sec. 57.204  EPA action on second period NSOs which have already been issued.

    (a) EPA may approve a second period NSO issued by a State before the 
date of publication of these regulations in the Federal Register, 
without requiring a complete reapplication under this subpart and new 
State proceedings, provided:
    (1) The second period NSO was issued by the State consistent with 
the procedural requirements of section 119 of the Clean Air Act;
    (2) EPA can make a determination that the smelter is eligible for a 
second period NSO and whether the smelter can comply with its 
SO<INF>2</INF> SIP limits on or before January 1, 1988 under the 
financial eligibility tests in these regulations on the basis of 
available information and such supplementary information as the Agency 
may request the smelter to submit; and
    (3) The provisions of the NSO are consistent with the requirements 
of these regulations.
    (b) Should EPA require a smelter to submit information before taking 
final action on an NSO referred to in paragraph (a), of this section, it 
shall specify a reasonable period for submission of such information in 
light of the nature of the information being required. The duration of 
such period shall not exceed the period allowed for submission of a 
complete application under Sec. 57.202 (a) and (b).
    (c) The Agency shall consider the SIP emission limitation for 
SO<INF>2</INF> to be suspended with respect to a smelter which received 
an NSO described in subpart A until EPA takes final action on such NSO. 
Such suspension shall terminate if the smelter does not submit 
supplementary information within the time specified under paragraph (b).


<R05>
Sec. 57.205  Submission of supplementary information upon relaxation of an 

SO[bdi2] SIP emission limitation.

    (a) In the event an SO<INF>2</INF> SIP limit is relaxed subsequent 
to EPA approval or issuance of a second period NSO, the smelter issued 
the NSO shall submit to the issuing agency and EPA such supplementary 
information that EPA considers appropriate for purposes of determining 
whether the means of compliance with the new SIP limit are adequately 
demonstrated to be reasonably available under the financial eligibility 
tests specified in Sec. 57.102(b)(3). The smelter shall submit such 
information within sixty days of notification by EPA. This time limit 
may be extended by EPA for good cause.
    (b) Upon receipt of any supplementary information required under

[[Page 162]]

paragraph (a), the issuing agency shall promptly reevaluate the 
availability of the means of compliance with the new SIP limit under the 
NSO eligibility tests specified in Sec. 57.102(b)(3). If the issuing 
agency determines that the demonstrated control technology necessary to 
attain the new SO<INF>2</INF> SIP limit is adequately demonstrated to be 
reasonably available under the eligibility tests, so as to permit the 
smelter to comply with the new SIP limit on or before January 1, 1988, 
the NSO shall be amended within the time contemplated by Sec. 57.202(a) 
after receipt of the supplementary information. Such amendment shall 
require compliance with the new SO<INF>2</INF> SIP limit as 
expeditiously as practicable in accordance with Sec. 57.201(d)(3). The 
issuing agency, if not EPA, shall promptly submit its determination and 
any necessary NSO amendments to EPA.
    (c) EPA shall take action to approve or disapprove the issuing 
agency's determination and NSO amendment, if any, within a reasonable 
time after receipt of such determination and amendment.
    (d) If EPA disapproves the issuing agency's determination or NSO 
amendment, or if a smelter fails to submit any supplementary information 
as required under paragraph (a), EPA and/or the issuing agency shall 
take appropriate remedial action. EPA shall take appropriate remedial 
action if the issuing agency does not make any determination and 
amendment required by this section within the time contemplated by Sec. 
57.202(a).


<R04>
          Subpart C_Constant Controls and Related Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 57.301  General requirements.

    Each NSO shall require an interim level of sulfur dioxide constant 
controls to be operated at the smelter, unless a waiver of this 
requirement has been granted to the owner under subpart H of this part. 
Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 57.304, the interim constant 
controls shall be properly operated and maintained at all times. The NSO 
shall require the following gas streams to be treated by interim 
constant controls:
    (a) In copper smelters, off-gases from fluidized bed roasters, flash 
furnaces, NORANDA reactors, electric furnaces and copper converters;
    (b) In lead smelters, off-gases from the front end of the sintering 
machine and any other sinter gases which are recirculated;
    (c) In zinc smelters, off-gases from mult-hearth roasters, flash 
roasters and fluidized bed roasters; and
    (d) In all primary nonferrous smelters, all other strong 
SO<INF>2</INF> streams.
    (e) In all primary nonferrous smelters, any other process streams 
which were regularly or intermittently treated by constant controls at 
the smelter as of August 7, 1977.


<R05>
Sec. 57.302  Performance level of interim constant controls.

    (a) Maximum feasible efficiency. Each NSO shall require: that the 
smelter operate its interim constant control systems at their maximum 
feasible efficiency, including the making of any improvements necessary 
to correct the effects of any serious deficiencies; that the process and 
control equipment be maintained in the way best designed to ensure such 
operation; and that process operations be scheduled and coordinated to 
facilitate treatment of process gas streams to the maximum possible 
extent. Maximum feasible efficiency shall be expressed in the NSO in the 
form of a limitation on the concentration of SO<INF>2</INF> in the tail 
gas of each individual control system in combination with an appropriate 
averaging period, as provided below in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section.
    (b) The limitation level for SO<INF>2</INF> concentration in the 
control system tail gas. The level at which the concentration limitation 
is set shall take into account fluctuations in the strength and volume 
of process off-gases to the extent that those fluctuations affect the 
SO<INF>2</INF> content of the tail gas and cannot be avoided by improved 
scheduling and coordination of process operations. The limitation shall 
exclude the effect of any increase in emissions caused by process or 
control equipment malfunction. The limitation shall take into account 
unavoidable catalyst deterioration in sulfuric acid plants, but may 
prescribe the frequency of catalyst

[[Page 163]]

screening or replacement. The NSO shall also prohibit the smelter owner 
from using dilution air to meet the limitation.
    (c) Averaging period. (1) The averaging period shall be derived in 
combination with the concentration limitation and shall take into 
account the same factors described in paragraph (b). The averaging 
period established under this paragraph should generally not exceed the 
following:
    (i) For sulfuric acid plants on copper smelters, 12-hour running 
average;
    (ii) For sulfuric acid plants on lead smelters, 6-hour running 
average;
    (iii) For sulfuric acid plants on zinc smelters, 2-hour running 
average;
    (iv) For dimethylaniline (DMA) scrubbing units on copper smelters, 
2-hour running average.
    (2) A different averaging period may be established if the applicant 
demonstrates that such a period is necessary in order to account for the 
factors described in paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, that the 
period is enforceable and satisfies the criteria of paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (d) Improved performance. (1) The performance level representing 
maximum feasible efficiency for any existing control system (e.g., a 
sulfuric acid plant or a DMA scrubber) shall require the correction of 
the effects of any serious deficiencies in the system. For the purpose 
of this paragraph, at least the following problems shall constitute 
serious deficiencies in acid plants:
    (i) Heat exchangers and associated equipment inadequate to sustain 
efficient, autothermal operation at the average gas strengths and 
volumes received by the acid plant during routine process equipment 
operation;
    (ii) Failure to completely fill all available catalyst bed stages 
with sufficient catalyst;
    (iii) Inability of the gas pre-treatment system to prevent unduly 
frequent plugging or fouling (deterioration) of catalyst or other 
components of the acid plant; or
    (iv) Blower capacity inadequate to permit the treatment of the full 
volume of gas which the plant could otherwise accommodate, or in-leakage 
of air into the flues leading to the plant, to the extent that this 
inadequacy results in bypassing of gas around the plant.
    (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Sec. 57.304(c) 
(malfunction demonstration), no excess emissions (as defined in Sec. 
57.304(a)) shall be considered to have resulted from a malfunction in 
the constant control system if the smelter owner has not upgraded 
serious deficiencies in the constant control system in compliance with 
the requirements of Sec. 57.302(d)(1), unless the smelter owner 
demonstrates under Sec. 57.304(c) that compliance with those 
requirements would not have affected the magnitude of the emission.
    (e) Multiple control devices. (1) At any smelter where off-gas 
streams are treated by various existing control systems (e.g., multiple 
acid plants or a DMA scrubber and an acid plant), the NSO shall require 
the use of those systems in the combination that will result in the 
maximum feasible net SO<INF>2</INF> removal.
    (2) To the extent that compliance with this requirement is 
demonstrated by the smelter operator to result in excess emissions 
during unavoidable start up and shut down of the control systems, those 
excess emissions shall not constitute violations of the NSO.


<R05>
Sec. 57.303  Total plantwide emission limitation.

    (a) Calculation of the emission limitation. Each NSO shall contain a 
requirement limiting the total allowable emissions from the smelter to 
the level which would have been associated with production at the 
smelter's maximum production capacity (as defined in Sec. 57.103(r)) as 
of August 7, 1977. This limitation shall be expressed in units of mass 
per time and shall be calculated as the sum of uncontrolled process and 
fugitive emissions, and emissions from any control systems (operating at 
the efficiency prescribed under Sec. 57.302). These emission rates may 
be derived from either direct measurements or appropriately documented 
mass balance calculations.
    (b) Compliance with the emission limitation. Each NSO shall require 
the use of specific, enforceable testing methods and measurement periods 
for determining compliance with the limitation

[[Page 164]]

established under paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 57.304  Bypass, excess emissions and malfunctions.

    (a) Definition of excess emissions. For the purposes of this 
subpart, any emissions greater than those permitted by the NSO 
provisions established under Sec. 57.302 (performance level of interim 
constant controls) or Sec. 57.303 (plantwide emission limitation) of 
this subpart shall constitute excess emissions. Emission of any gas 
stream identified under Sec. 57.301 (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this 
subpart that is not treated by a sulfur dioxide constant control system 
shall also constitute an excess emission under this subpart.
    (b) The excess emission report. Each NSO shall require the smelter 
to report all excess emissions to the issuing agency, as provided in 
Sec. 57.305(b). The report shall include the following:
    (1) Identity of the stack or other emission points where the excess 
emissions occurred;
    (2) Magnitude of the excess emissions expressed in the units of each 
applicable emission limitation, as well as the operating data, 
documents, and calculations used in determining the magnitude of the 
excess emissions;
    (3) Time and duration of the excess emissions;
    (4) Identity of the equipment causing the excess emissions;
    (5) Nature and cause of such excess emissions;
    (6) Steps taken to limit the excess emissions, and when those steps 
were commenced;
    (7) If the excess emissions were the result of a malfunction, the 
steps taken to remedy the malfunction and to prevent the recurrence of 
such malfunction; and
    (8) At the smelter owner's election, the demonstration specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Malfunction demonstration. Except as provided in Sec. 
57.302(e)(2) or in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, any excess 
emission shall be a violation of the NSO unless the owner demonstrates 
in the excess emissions report required under paragraph (b) of this 
section that the excess emission resulted from a malfunction (or an 
unavoidable start up and shut down resulting from a malfunction) and 
that:
    (1) The air pollution control systems, process equipment, or 
processes were at all times maintained and operated, to the maximum 
extent practicable, in a manner consistent with good practice for 
minimizing emissions;
    (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as practicable, including the 
use of off-shift labor and overtime;
    (3) The amount and duration of the excess emissions were minimized 
to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
    (4) The excess emissions were not part of a recurring pattern 
indicative of serious deficiencies in, or inadequate operation, design, 
or maintenance of, the process or control equipment.
    (d) Scheduled maintenance exception. Excess emissions occurring 
during scheduled maintenance shall not constitute violations of the NSO 
to the extent that:
    (1) The expected additional annual sulfur dioxide removal by any 
control system (including associated process changes) for which 
construction had not commenced (as defined in 40 CFR 60.2 (g) and (i)) 
as of August 7, 1977 and which the smelter owner agrees to install and 
operate under subpart F, would have offset such excess emissions if the 
system had been in operation throughout the year in which the 
maintenance was performed;
    (2) The system is installed and operated as provided in the NSO 
provisions established under subpart F; and
    (3) The system performs at substantially the expected efficiency and 
reliability subsequent to its initial break-in period.
    (e) An NSO may provide that excess emissions which occur during acid 
plant start-up as the result of the cooling of acid plant catalyst due 
to the unavailability of process gas to an acid plant during a prolonged 
SCS curtailment or scheduled maintenance are not excess emissions. If 
the NSO does so provide, it shall also require the use of techniques or 
practices designed to minimize these excess emissions, such as the 
sealing of the acid plant during prolonged curtailments, the use of 
auxiliary heat or SO<INF>2</INF> injected during the curtailment, or the 
preheating of the

[[Page 165]]

acid plant before start-up of the process equipment it serves.
    (f) Requirements for a smelter with constant controls that applies 
for a waiver.
    (1) If a smelter that has some interim constant controls applies for 
a waiver in accordance with subpart H, the following requirements shall 
apply pending action on the waiver application and following final 
action granting or approving a waiver:
    (i) The NSO shall require the smelter to implement maintenance and 
operation measures designed to reduce to the maximum extent feasible the 
potential for bypass of existing interim constant controls.
    (ii) Upon application for a waiver under subpart H, the smelter 
shall submit to the issuing agency for its approval and to EPA proposed 
maintenance and operation measures for compliance with the requirements 
of paragraph (i).
    (iii) The remainder of this subpart shall apply except that: (A) The 
emission limitations required under this subpart shall be based only on 
existing constant control equipment as upgraded through the improved 
maintenance and operation required by this paragraph, and (B) bypass of 
existing controls shall not constitute excess emissions, provided the 
maintenance and operation requirements and emission limitations 
prescribed by the NSO are satisfied.
    (2) After any denial of a waiver by the issuing Agency, or any 
disapproval by EPA of a waiver granted by the issuing agency, the NSO 
shall be amended consistent with the requirements of this subpart and 
Sec. 57.702.


<R05>
Sec. 57.305  Compliance monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Monitoring. (1) Each NSO shall require compliance with the 
control system performance requirements established pursuant to this 
subpart to be determined through the use of continuous monitors for 
measuring SO<INF>2</INF> concentration.
    (i) Such monitors must be installed, operated and maintained in 
accordance with the performance specifications and other requirements 
contained in appendix D to 40 CFR part 52 or part 60. The monitors must 
take and record at least one measurement of SO<INF>2</INF> concentration 
from the effluent of each control system in each 15-minute period. 
Failure of the monitors to record at least 95% of the 15-minute periods 
in any 30-day period shall constitute a violation of the NSO.
    (ii) The sampling point shall be located at least 8 stack diameters 
(diameter measured at sampling point) downstream and 2 diameters 
upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, 
constriction, or flame, unless another location is approved by the 
Administrator.
    (iii) The sampling point for monitoring emissions shall be in the 
duct at the centroid of the cross section if the cross sectional area is 
less than 4.645m\2\ (50 ft\2\) or at a point no closer to the wall than 
0.914m (3 ft) if the cross sectional area is 4.645m\2\ (50 ft\2\) or 
more. The monitor sample point shall be in an area of small spatial 
concentration gradient and shall be representative of the concentration 
in the duct.
    (iv) The measurement system(s) installed and used pursuant to this 
paragraph shall be subject to the manufacturer's recommended zero 
adjustment and calibration procedures at least once per 24-hour 
operating period unless the manufacturer specifies or recommends 
calibration at shorter intervals, in which case such specifications or 
recommendations shall be followed. Records of these procedures shall be 
made which clearly show instrument readings before and after zero 
adjustment and calibration.
    (2) Each NSO shall require the monitoring of any ducts or flues used 
to bypass gases, required under this subpart to be treated by constant 
controls, around the smelter's sulfur dioxide constant control system(s) 
for ultimate discharge to the atmosphere. Such monitoring shall be 
adequate to disclose the time of the bypass, its duration, and the 
approximate volume and SO<INF>2</INF> concentration of gas bypassed.
    (b) Reporting. (1) Each NSO shall require that the smelter maintain 
a record of all measurements required under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Results shall be summarized monthly and shall be submitted to 
the issuing agency within 15 days after the end of each

[[Page 166]]

month. The smelter owner shall retain a record of such measurements for 
one year after the NSO period terminates.
    (2) Each NSO shall require that the smelter maintain a record of all 
measurements and calculations required under Sec. 57.303(b). Results 
shall be summarized on a monthly basis and shall be submitted to the 
issuing agency at 6-month intervals. The smelter owner shall retain a 
record of such measurements and calculations for at least one year after 
the NSO terminates.
    (3) The report required under Sec. 57.304(b) shall accompany the 
report required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Quality assurance and continuous data--(1) Quality assurance. 
Each NSO shall require that the smelter submit a plan for quality 
assurance to the issuing agency for approval and that all monitoring 
performed by continuous monitors shall be verified for quality assurance 
by the smelter. Such plans must follow current EPA guidelines for 
quality assurance, in order to be approvable.
    (2) Continuous data. Manual source testing methods equivalent to 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used to determine compliance if the 
continuous monitoring system malfunctions.


<R04>
           Subpart D_Supplementary Control System Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 57.401  General requirements.

    Except as provided in subpart E, each NSO shall require the smelter 
owner to prevent all violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's designated 
liability area (DLA) through the operation of an approved supplementary 
control system (SCS).


<R05>
Sec. 57.402  Elements of the supplementary control system.

    Each supplementary control system shall contain the following 
elements:
    (a) Air quality monitoring network. An approvable SCS shall include 
the use of appropriate ambient air quality monitors to continuously 
measure the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air in the smelter's 
DLA.
    (1) The monitors shall be located at all points of expected 
SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations necessary to anticipate and prevent 
possible violations of NAAQS anywhere in the smelter's DLA. The 
determination of the locations where such concentrations may occur shall 
take into account all recorded or probable meteorological and operating 
conditions (including bypassing of control equipment), as well as the 
presence of other sources of SO<INF>2</INF> significantly affecting 
SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations in the DLA.
    (2) The number and location of sites shall be based on dispersion 
modeling, measured ambient air quality data, meteorological information, 
and the results of the continuing review required by paragraph (f) of 
this section. The system shall include the use of at least 7 fixed 
monitors unless the issuing agency determines, on the basis of a 
demonstration by the smelter owner, that the use of fewer monitors would 
not limit coverage of points of high SO<INF>2</INF> concentration or 
otherwise reduce the capability of the smelter owner to prevent any 
violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA.
    (3) All monitors shall be continuously operated and maintained and 
shall meet the performance specifications contained in 40 CFR part 53. 
The monitors shall be capable of routine real time measurement of 
maximum expected SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations for the averaging times 
of SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
    (b) Meteorological network. The SCS must have a meteorological 
assessment capability adequate to predict and identify local conditions 
requiring emission curtailment to prevent possible violations of the 
NAAQS. The meteorological assessment capability shall provide all 
forecast and current information necessary for successful use of the SCS 
operational manual required by paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) Designated liability area. The system shall be required to 
prevent all violations of the NAAQS within the smelter's DLA. The DLA of 
any smelter is the area within which the smelter's emissions may cause 
or significantly contribute to violations of the NAAQS for 
SO<INF>2</INF> when the smelter is operating at its maximum production 
capacity under any recorded or probable meterological conditions. The 
boundaries of that area shall be specified in the NSO.

[[Page 167]]

    (1) Unless an acceptable demonstration is made under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, the DLA shall be a circle with a center point at 
the smelter's tallest stack and a minimum radius as given in the 
following table:

       Radius for SO2 Emissions at Maximum Production Capacity \1\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         Emission rate in      Radius in
   Emissions rate in tons per hour        grains per sec.     kilometers
------------------------------------------------------------------------
16 or less..........................  4,000 or less.........         11
24..................................  6,000.................         16
32..................................  8,000.................         24
40..................................  10,000................         32
48 or more..........................  12,000 or more........         40
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Maximum emission rates for periods not to exceed 24 hours. Minimum
  radii may be determined from the table by linear interpolation.

    (2) The NSO may provide for a DLA with different boundaries if the 
smelter owner can demonstrate through the use of appropriate dispersion 
modeling and ambient air quality monitoring data that the smelter's 
controlled emissions could not cause or significantly contribute to a 
violation of the NAAQS beyond the boundaries of such a different area 
under any recorded or probable meteorological conditions.
    (3) A violation of the NAAQS in the DLA of any smelter shall 
constitute a violation of that smelter's NSO, unless the issuing agency 
determines on the basis of a showing by the smelter owner that the 
smelter owner had taken all emission curtailment action indicated by the 
SCS operational manual and that the violation was caused in significant 
part by:
    (i) Emissions of another source(s) which were in excess of the 
maximum permissible emissions applicable to such source(s),
    (ii) Fugitive emissions of another source(s), or
    (iii) The smelter's own fugitive emissions: Provided, that the 
smelter is in compliance with all requirements of or under subpart E of 
this part.
    (4) For the purposes of this section, maximum permissible emissions 
for other sources are the highest of:
    (i) SIP emission limitation;
    (ii) Orders in effect under section 113(d) of the Clean Air Act; or
    (d) Overlapping designated liability areas. Notwithstanding any 
other provisions of this subpart, the following requirements shall apply 
whenever the designated liability areas of 2 or more smelters do, or 
may, overlap:
    (1) In the case of any NSO applicant that would have a DLA which 
would overlap with the DLA of any other smelter that has applied for an 
NSO or has an NSO in effect, the NSO applicant shall include in its 
application an enforceable joint plan, agreed to by such other 
smelter(s). In determining whether a joint plan is required, the NSO 
applicant shall calculate its DLA according to the table in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section. The DLA of the other smelter shall be calculated 
according to the table in paragraph (c)(1) unless the other smelter has 
an NSO in effect, in which case the boundaries in that NSO shall be 
used. The enforceable joint plan shall provide for:
    (i) Emission curtailment adequate to ensure that the NAAQS will not 
be violated in any areas of overlapping DLAs; and
    (ii) Conclusive prospective allocation of legal liability in the 
event that the NAAQS are violated in the area of overlapping DLAs.

Such plans may, but need not, include the operation of a joint SCS 
system. Each NSO shall require adherence by the NSO applicant owner to 
the joint plan for emission curtailment and allocation of liability, 
unless the issuing agency determines, pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that the NSO applicant's DLA does not 
overlap with that of any other smelter.
    (2) In the case of any NSO applicant that would have a DLA which 
would overlap with the DLA of any other smelter whose owner has not 
applied for an NSO (and does not have an NSO in effect), the NSO 
applicant's submittal shall contain a written consent, signed by a 
corporate official empowered to do so. The consent shall state that if, 
at any time thereafter, the owner of the other smelter applies for an 
NSO, and the other smelter's DLA would overlap with the NSO applicant's 
DLA, the NSO applicant will negotiate and submit an enforceable joint 
plan

[[Page 168]]

for emission curtailment and allocation of liability (as described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section). In determining whether it is 
necessary to submit such a consent, each smelter's DLA shall be 
calculated according to the table set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. The consent shall state that a joint plan shall be submitted 
within 90 days of the issuing agency's notification to the NSO applicant 
of receipt of the other smelter's letter of intent, unless the issuing 
agency determines that the DLAs do not overlap. Failure of the NSO 
applicant to submit such a plan shall constitute grounds for denial of 
its NSO application or a violation of an effective NSO, as applicable.
    (e) The SCS operational manual. Each NSO shall require the smelter 
to be operated in accordance with the provisions of an SCS operational 
manual approved by the issuing agency. The SCS operational manual shall 
describe the circumstances under which, the extent to which, and the 
procedures through which emissions shall be curtailed to prevent 
violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA. Failure to curtail 
emissions when and as much as indicated by the manual or to follow the 
provisions of the manual implementing the requirements of paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section shall constitute a violation of the NSO.
    (1) The operational manual shall prescribe emission curtailment 
decisions based on the use of real time information from the air quality 
monitoring network dispersion model estimates of the effect of emissions 
on air quality, and meteorological observations and predictions.
    (2) The operational manual shall also provide for emission 
curtailment to prevent violation of the NAAQS within the smelter's DLA 
which may be caused in part by stack emissions, and to the extent 
practicable fugitive emissions, from any other source (unless that other 
source is a smelter subject to an NSO).
    (3) The SCS operational manual shall include (but not be limited 
to):
    (i) A clear delineation of the authority of the SCS operator to 
require all other smelter personnel to implement the operator's 
curtailment decisions;
    (ii) The maintenance and calibration procedures and schedules for 
all SCS equipment;
    (iii) A description of the procedures to be followed for the regular 
acquisition of all meteorological information necessary to operate the 
system;
    (iv) The ambient concentrations and meteorological conditions that 
will be used as criteria for determining the need for various degrees of 
emission curtailment;
    (v) The meteorological variables as to which judgments may be made 
in applying the criteria stated pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this 
section;
    (vi) The procedures through which and the maximum time period within 
which a curtailment decision will be made and implemented by the SCS 
operator;
    (vii) The method for immediately evaluating the adequacy of a 
particular curtailment decision, including the factors to be considered 
in that evaluation;
    (viii) The procedures through which and the time within which 
additional necessary curtailment will immediately be effected; and
    (ix) The procedures to be followed to protect the NAAQS in the event 
of a mechanical failure in any element of the SCS.
    (f) Continuing review and improvement of the SCS. Each NSO shall 
require the smelter owner to conduct an active program to continuously 
review the design and operation of the SCS to determine what measures 
may be available for improving the performance of the system. Among the 
elements of this program shall be measures to locate and examine 
possible places both inside and outside the DLA where unmonitored NAAQS 
violations may be occurring. Such measures shall include the use of 
modeling as appropriate and mobile ambient air quality monitors, 
following up on information and complaints from members of the public, 
and other appropriate activities. The NSO shall also require the 
submission of a semi-annual report to the issuing agency detailing the 
results of this review and specifying measures implemented to prevent 
the recurrence of any violations of NAAQS.

[[Page 169]]


<R05>
Sec. 57.403  Written consent.

    (a) The consent. The NSO shall include a written consent, signed by 
a corporate official empowered to do so, in the following form:

    As a condition of receiving a Primary Nonferrous Smelter Order (NSO) 
under Section 119 of the Clean Air Act, for the smelter operated by 
(name of company) at (location), the undersigned official, being 
empowered to do so, consents for the company as follows:
    (1) In any civil proceeding (judicial or administrative) to enforce 
the NSO, the company will not contest:
    (a) Liability for any violation of the National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards for sulfur dioxide in the smelter's designated liability area 
(DLA), except on the ground that a determination under 40 CFR 
57.402(c)(3) was clearly wrong; or
    (b) The conclusive allocation of liability under NSO provisions 
satisfying 40 CFR 57.402(d)(1) between the company's smelter and any 
other smelter(s) for any violation of the National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards for sulfur dioxide in an area of overlapping DLAs.
    (2) The issuing agency (as defined in 40 CFR 57.103) will be allowed 
unrestricted access at reasonable times to inspect, verify calibration 
of, and obtain data from ambient air quality monitors operated by the 
company under the requirements of the NSO.

    (b) Rights not waived by the consent. This consent shall not be 
deemed to waive any right(s) to judicial review of any provisions of an 
NSO that are otherwise available to the smelter owner or operator under 
section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act.


<R05>
Sec. 57.404  Measurements, records, and reports.

    (a) Measurements. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to 
install, operate, and maintain a measurement system(s) for continuously 
monitoring sulfur dioxide emissions and stack gas volumetric flow rates 
in each stack (except a stack used exclusively for bypassing control 
equipment) which could emit 5 percent or more of the smelter's total 
potential (uncontrolled) hourly sulfur dioxide emissions.
    (1) Such monitors shall be installed, operated, and maintained in 
accordance with the performance specifications and other requirements 
contained in appendices D and E to 40 CFR part 52. The monitors must 
take and record at least one measurement of sulfur dioxide concentration 
and stack gas flow rate from the effluent of each affected stack in each 
fifteen-minute period. (The NSO shall require the smelter operator to 
devise and implement any procedures necessary for compliance with these 
performance specifications.)
    (2) The sampling point shall be located at least eight stack 
diameters (diameter measured at sampling point) downstream and two 
diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, 
constriction, or flame, unless another location is approved by the 
Administrator.
    (3) The sampling point for monitoring emissions shall be in the duct 
at the centroid of the cross section if the cross sectional area is less 
than 4.645 m\2\ (50 ft \2\) or at a point no closer to the wall than 
0.914m (3 ft) if the cross sectional area is 4.645 m\2\ (50 ft\2\) or 
more. The monitor sample point shall be in an area of small spatial 
concentration gradient and shall provide a sample which is 
representative of the concentration in the duct.
    (4) The measurement system(s) installed and used pursuant to this 
paragraph shall be subject to the manufacturer's recommended zero 
adjustment and calibration procedures at least once per 24-hour 
operating period unless the manufacturer specifies or recommends 
calibration at shorter intervals, in which case such specifications or 
recommendations shall be followed. Records of these procedures shall be 
made which clearly show instrument readings before and after zero 
adjustment and calibration.
    (5) The results of such monitoring, calibration, and maintenance 
shall be submitted in the form and with the frequency specified in the 
NSO.
    (b) Records. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to maintain 
records of the air quality measurements made, meteorological information 
acquired, emission curtailment ordered (including the identity of the 
persons making such decisions), and calibration and maintenance 
performed on SCS monitors during the operation of the SCS. These records 
shall be maintained for the duration of the NSO.
    (c) Reports. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to:

[[Page 170]]

    (1) Submit a monthly summary indicating all places and times at 
which the NAAQS for SO<INF>2</INF> were violated in the smelter's DLA, 
and stating the SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations at such times;
    (2) Immediately notify EPA and the State agency any time 
concentrations of SO<INF>2</INF> in the ambient air in the smelter's DLA 
reaches 0.3 part per million (800 micrograms/cubic meter), 24-hour 
average, or exceed the warning stage in any more stringent emergency 
plan in the applicable State Implementation Plan; and
    (3) Make such other reports as may be specified in the NSO.


<R05>
Sec. 57.405  Formulation, approval, and implementation of requirements.

    (a) SCS content of the application. The requirements of Sec. 
57.203(d) shall be satisfied with respect to this subpart as follows:
    (1) Each NSO application shall include a complete description of any 
supplementary control system in operation at the smelter at the time of 
application and a copy of any SCS operational manual in use with that 
system.
    (2) Each NSO application shall contain proposed NSO provisions for 
compliance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 57.401, 57.402 (c), (d), 
and (f), 57.403, 57.404, and 57.405 (b)(2).
    (3) Each NSO application shall include a specific plan for the 
development of a system fulfilling the requirements of Sec. 57.402(a), 
(b), and (e) (covering air quality monitoring network, meteorological 
network, and the SCS operational manual).
    (b) SCS content of the order. (1) Each NSO shall include an approved 
version of the plan described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and 
shall provide increments of progress towards its completion. Each NSO 
shall require, upon completion of the measures specified in the approved 
plan, submission of a report which describes each element of the SCS and 
explains why the elements satisfy the requirements of the plan and 
submission of a copy of the SCS operational manual developed under the 
plan.
    (2) Each NSO shall require the submission of a final report, within 
6 months of the required date for completion of the measures specified 
in the approved plan evaluating the performance and adequacy of the SCS 
developed pursuant to the approved plan. The report shall include:
    (i) A detailed description of how the criteria that form the basis 
for particular curtailment decisions were derived;
    (ii) A complete description of each SCS element listed in Sec. 
57.402 (a) through (d) (covering monitoring, meteorology, and the DLA), 
and an explanation of why the elements fulfill the requirements of those 
sections;
    (iii) A reliability study demonstrating that the SCS will prevent 
violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA at all times. The 
reliability study shall include a comprehensive analysis of the system's 
operation during one or more three-month seasonal periods when 
meteorological conditions creating the most serious risk of NAAQS 
violations are likely to occur. Where it is impossible, because of time 
restraints, to include in such a study and analysis of the three month 
seasonal period with meteorological conditions creating the most serious 
risk of NAAQS violations, the study shall analyze the system's operation 
on the basis of all available information. The NSO shall provide that in 
such case, a supplemental reliability study shall be submitted after the 
end of the worst case three-month period as a part of the next semi-
annual report required under Sec. 57.402(f).
    (iv) A copy of the current SCS operational manual.
    (c) Amendment of the NSO. Each NSO shall be amended, if necessary, 
within 3 months of completion of the measures required under the SCS 
development plan and also, if necessary, within three months of 
submission of the final report or any supplement to the final report 
required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, to reflect the most 
current approved elements of the SCS and, as appropriate, to fulfill all 
other requirements of this subpart. Each NSO shall also be subsequently 
amended (as provided in Sec. 57.104) whenever necessary as a result of 
the program required by Sec. 57.402(f) or to reflect improved SCS 
operating procedures or other system requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 57.501  General requirements.

    (a) Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to use such control 
measures as may be necessary to ensure that the smelter's fugitive 
emissions do not result in violations of the NAAQS for SO<INF>2</INF> in 
the smelter's DLA.
    (b) A smelter which is operating under an NSO containing a SIP 
compliance schedule established in accordance with Sec. 57.705 is 
required to be making progress toward compliance with any fugitive 
control requirements contained in its respective SIP and need not meet 
the other requirements contained in this subpart.
    (c) A smelter which is subject to an NSO which does not contain a 
SIP compliance schedule must meet the provisions of Sec. Sec. 57.502 
and 57.503.


<R05>
Sec. 57.502  Evaluation.

    (a) Evaluation at the time of application. Any smelter owner may 
demonstrate at the time of application for an NSO that the smelter's 
SO<INF>2</INF> fugitive emissions will not cause or significant 
contribute to violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA. If such 
demonstration is not made, the smelter owner shall submit the design and 
workplan for a study adequate to assess the sources of significant 
fugitive emissions from the smelter and their effects upon ambient air 
quality.
    (b) Evaluation during the first 6 months of the NSO. The design and 
workplan of the study shall be approved, if adequate, by the issuing 
agency and included in the NSO. The study shall commence no later than 
the date when the NSO becomes effective and an analysis of its results 
shall be submitted to the issuing agency within 6 months of the 
effective date of the NSO. The study shall include an appropriate period 
during which the ambient air shall be monitored to determine the impact 
of fugitive emissions of sulfur dioxide, arsenic (at copper smelters 
only), lead (at lead and zinc smelters only), and total suspended 
particulates on the ambient air quality in the smelter's DLA.


<R05>
Sec. 57.503  Control measures.

    The NSO of any smelter subject to the requirements of Sec. 
57.502(b) shall be amended, if necessary, within 6 months of EPA's 
receipt of the analysis specified in Sec. 57.502(b), as provided in 
Sec. 57.704(c) to implement the requirement of Sec. 57.501. Measures 
required to be implemented may include:
    (a) Additional supplementary control. The use of the supplementary 
control system, if the additional use of the system does not interfere 
with the smelter owner's ability to meet the requirements of subpart D; 
and
    (b) Engineering and maintenance techniques. The use of engineering 
and maintenance techniques to detect and prevent leaks and capture and 
vent fugitive emissions through appropriate stacks. These techniques

    (4) For converters, installation and proper operation of primary 
hoods for blowing operations, and where appropriate, secondary hoods for 
charging and pouring operations;
    (5) For sintering machines, installation and proper operation of 
primary hoods on the sinter bed, all hot sinter ignition points, all 
concentrate laydown points, and all hot sinter transfer points;
    (6) For blast furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary 
hoods on all active slag and lead bullion furnace tap holes and transfer 
points;
    (7) For dross reverberatory furnaces, installation and proper 
operation of primary hoods on all active charging and discharging 
points;
    (8) Maintenance of all ducts, flues and stacks in a leak-free 
condition to the maximum extent possible;
    (9) Maintenance of all process equipment under normal operating 
conditions in such a fashion that out-leakage of fugitive gases will be 
prevented to the maximum extent possible;

[[Page 172]]

    (10) Secondary or tertiary hooding on process equipment where 
necessary; and
    (11) Partial or complete building evacuation as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 57.504  Continuing evaluation of fugitive emission control measures.

    Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to conduct an active 
program to continuously review the effectiveness of the fugitive 
emission control measures implemented pursuant to Sec. 57.503 in 
maintaining the NAAQS and, if such measures are not sufficiently 
effective, to evaluate what additional measures should be taken to 
assure that the NAAQS will be maintained with a reasonably degree of 
reliability. The NSO shall also require submission of a semi-annual 
report to the issuing Agency detailing the results of this review and 
evaluation. Such a report may be submitted as part of the report 
required under Sec. 57.402(f).


<R05>
Sec. 57.505  Amendments of the NSO.

    An NSO shall be amended within three months of submission of any 
report required under Sec. 57.504 so as to require additional fugitive 
emission control measures if such report establishes that such 
additional measures are necessary to assure that the NAAQS will be 
maintained with a reasonable degree of reliability.


<R04>
             Subpart F_Research and Development Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 57.601  General requirements.

    (a) This subpart is not applicable to NSOs which contain a SIP 
compliance schedule in accordance with Sec. 57.705.
    (b) The requirements of this subpart may be waived with respect to a 
smelter if the owner of that smelter submits with its NSO application a 
written certification by a corporate official authorized to make such a 
certification that the smelter will either comply with its 
SO<INF>2</INF> SIP limits by January 2, 1988 or close after January 1, 
1988 until it can comply with such limits.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b), each NSO shall 
require the smelter to conduct or participate in a specific research and 
development program designed to develop more effective means of 
compliance with the sulfur dioxide control requirements of the 
applicable State Implementation Plan than presently exist.


<R05>
Sec. 57.602  Approval of proposal.

    (a) The smelter owner's proposal. The smelter owner's NSO 
application shall include a proposed NSO provision for implementing the 
requirement of Sec. 57.601, a fully documented supporting analysis of 
the proposed program, and an evaluation of the consistency of the 
proposed program with the criteria listed in Sec. 57.603. The 
application shall also specify:
    (1) The design and substantive elements of the research and 
development program, including the expected amount of time required for 
their implementation;
    (2) The annual expected capital, operating, and other costs of each 
element in the program;
    (3) The smelter's current production processes, pollution control 
equipment, and emissions which are likely to be affected by the program;
    (4) Potential or expected benefits of the program;
    (5) The basis upon which the results of the program will be 
evaluated; and
    (6) The names, positions, and qualifications of the individuals 
responsible for conducting and supervising the project.
    (b) EPA approval. (1) If the issuing agency will not be EPA, the 
smelter owner or the issuing agency may also submit to EPA the 
information specified in paragraph (a) of this section at the same time 
the information is submitted to the issuing agency. As soon as possible 
after the receipt of the information described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, EPA shall certify to the issuing agency and to the applicant 
whether or not in the judgment of the Administrator the smelter owner's 
final proposals are approvable. If EPA does not receive an advance copy 
of the proposal, the ultimate approval will occur when the NSO is 
approved rather than in advance of receipt of the NSO.
    (2) A prerequisite for approval of an R&D proposal by EPA and any 
issuing agency is that the planned work must yield the most cost 
effective technology possible.

[[Page 173]]

    (c) Optional preproposal. The smelter owner may, at its option, 
submit to EPA for its approval and comment a preproposal generally 
describing the project the owner intends to propose under paragraph (a) 
of this section. A preproposal may be submitted to EPA any time prior to 
the submission of a proposal under paragraph (a) of this section. As 
soon as possible after the receipt of a preproposal, EPA shall certify 
to the applicant (and to any other issuing agency, as applicable) 
whether or not the project would be approvable. This certification may 
include comments indicating necessary modifications which would make the 
project approvable.


<R05>
Sec. 57.603  Criteria for approval.

    The approvability of any proposed research and development program 
shall be judged primarily according to the following criteria:
    (a) The likelihood that the project will result in the use of more 
effective means of emission limitation by the smelter within a 
reasonable period of time and that the technology can be implemented at 
the smelter in question, should the smelter be placed on a SIP 
compliance schedule at some future date when adequately demonstrated 
technology is reasonably available;
    (b) Whether the proposed funding and staffing of the project appear 
adequate for its successful completion;
    (c) Whether the proposed level of funding for the project is 
consistent with the research and development expenditure levels for 
pollution control found in other industries;
    (d) The potential that the project may yield industrywide pollution 
control benefits;
    (e) Whether the project may also improve control of other pollutants 
of both occupational and environmental significance;
    (f) The potential effects of the project on energy conservation; and
    (g) Other non-air quality health and environmental considerations.


<R05>
Sec. 57.604  Evaluation of projects.

    The research and development proposal shall include a provision for 
the employment of a qualified independent engineering firm to prepare 
written reports at least annually which evaluate each completed

               Subpart G_Compliance Schedule Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 57.701  General requirements.

    This section applies to all smelters applying for an NSO. Each NSO 
shall require the smelter owner to meet all of the requirements within 
the NSO as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than the 
deadlines contained in this subpart or any other section of

[[Page 174]]

these regulations. For requirements not immediately effective, the NSO 
shall provide increments of progress and a schedule for compliance. Each 
schedule must reflect the extent to which any required equipment or 
systems are already in place and the extent to which any required 
reports or studies have already been completed. Requirements for 
smelters to submit compliance schedules and the procedures which they 
must follow are outlined below.


<R05>
Sec. 57.702  Compliance with constant control emission limitation.

    (a) This section applies to all smelters which receive an NSO, but 
only to the extent this section is compatible with any SIP compliance 
schedule required by Sec. Sec. 57.201(d)(2) and 57.705.
    (b) Any NSO issued to a smelter not required to immediately comply 
with the requirements of subpart G under Sec. 57.701 shall contain a 
schedule for compliance with those requirements as expeditiously as 
practicable but in no case later than 6 months from the effective date 
of the NSO, except as follows: Where a waiver is requested in accordance 
with subpart H, an NSO may be issued without a schedule for compliance 
with the requirements for which a waiver is being considered consistent 
with subpart H, pending a final decision on the request under subpart H. 
If a waiver is requested in accordance with subpart H, compliance with 
the requirements of subpart C which were deferred as a result of such 
request shall be achieved as expeditiously as practicable after, but in 
no case later than 6 months from a final decision by the issuing agency 
to deny a waiver under subpart H or disapproval by EPA of a waiver 
granted by the issuing agency. The time limits specified herein may be 
extended only if a smelter operator demonstrates that special 
circumstances warrant more time, in which case the compliance schedule 
shall require compliance as expeditiously as practicable. An NSO which 
does not contain a schedule for compliance with all the requirements of 
subpart C because a waiver has been requested in accordance with subpart 
H shall be amended in accordance with Sec. 57.104 within three months 
after a final decision under subpart H so as to either grant a waiver of 
any remaining requirements of subpart C, or deny such a waiver and place 
the smelter on a compliance schedule for meeting those requirements. If 
the issuing agency grants a waiver and such waiver is disapproved by 
EPA, the issuing agency shall promptly amend the NSO so as to place the 
smelter on a compliance schedule meeting any remaining requirements of 
subpart C.
    (c) Any schedule required under this section shall contain the 
following information and increments of progress to the extent 
applicable:
    (1) Description of the overall design of the SO<INF>2</INF> control 
system(s) to be installed;
    (2) Descriptions of specific process hardware to be used in 
achieving compliance with interim SO<INF>2</INF> constant controls 
including gas capacity values;
    (3) The date by which contracts will be let or purchase orders 
issued to accomplish any necessary performance improvements;
    (4) The date for initiating on-site construction or installation of 
necessary equipment;
    (5) The date by which on-site construction or installation of 
equipment is to be completed; and
    (6) The date for achievement of final compliance with interim 
emission limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 57.703  Compliance with the supplementary control system requirements.

    This section applies to all nonferrous smelters applying for an NSO.
    (a) Schedules for smelters with existing SCS. Each NSO shall require 
immediately upon issuance of the NSO operation of any existing 
supplementary control system and immediately upon the effective date of 
the NSO the assumption of liability for all violations of the NAAQS 
detected by any monitor in the SCS system. Each NSO shall require that 
within six months of the effective date of the NSO the smelter complete 
any measures specified in the smelter's approved SCS development plan 
not implemented at the time the NSO is issued, and assume liability for 
all violations of the NAAQS detected

[[Page 175]]

anywhere in the DLA (except as provided in subpart D of these 
regulations). Other requirements of subpart D such as the requirements 
for submission of reports records, and for ongoing evaluation of the SCS 
shall be complied with at the times specified in subpart D and Sec. 
57.701.
    (b) Compliance schedule for smelters with no existing SCS system. 
Where a smelter has no SCS at the time of issuance of the NSO, the NSO 
shall require compliance with the requirements of subpart D according to 
the following schedule:
    (1) Within six months after the effective date of the NSO the 
smelter shall install all operating elements of the SCS system, begin 
operating the system, complete all other measures specified in its 
approved SCS development plan, begin compliance with the requirements of 
Sec. 57.404, and assume liability for any violations of the NAAQS 
within its designated liability area (except as provided by subpart D), 
detected by the SCS monitors in place.
    (2) Within nine months thereafter the smelter shall submit the SCS 
Report, assume liability for all violations of the NAAQS detected 
anywhere within its designated liability area, and comply with all other 
requirements of subpart D, except for those which subpart D specifies 
are to be satisfied at or after the close of such nine-month period, 
including requirements for submission of studies, reports, and records, 
and the requirements for continued review and evaluation of the SCS.


<R05>
Sec. 57.704  Compliance with fugitive emission evaluation and control 

requirements.

    This section applies only to smelters not required to submit SIP 
Compliance Schedules under Sec. 57.705. Each NSO shall require that 
smelters satisfy each of the requirements of subpart E as expeditiously 
as practicable, taking into account the extent to which those 
requirements have already been satisfied, and in any event, within any 
deadlines specified below.
    (a) Plan for fugitive emission control. The NSO shall provide that 
within a reasonable period after the submission of the report on the 
fugitive emission control study required by Sec. 57.502, but within a 
period allowing sufficient time for compliance with the requirement of 
Sec. 57.503 for amendment of the NSO, the smelter owner shall submit to 
the issuing agency for its approval a proposed fugitive emission control 
plan, including increments of progress, for compliance with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 57.501 and 57.503.
    (b) SCS Report. If the fugitive emission control plan submitted 
under paragraph (a) of this section proposes to meet the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 57.501 and 57.503 through the additional use of a 
supplementary control system, the plan shall demonstrate that the use of 
supplementary controls at that smelter to prevent violations of the 
NAAQS resulting from fugitive emissions is practicable, adequate, 
reliable, and enforceable. The plan shall contain increments of progress 
providing for completion of the implementation of each additional 
measure, and for corresponding compliance with the requirements of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 57.404, within four months of approval 
of the plan by the issuing agency. The plan shall also provide that 
within three months after completion of implementation of those 
additional measures, the smelter shall fully comply with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 57.401 and 57.501 (including the assumption 
of liability for violations of NAAQS within its designated liability 
area), and shall submit and additional SCS report for the approval of 
the issuing agency. This additional final report shall correspond to 
that submitted under Sec. 57.405(b)(2), except that it need not contain 
the 3-month study described in Sec. 57.405(b)(2)(iii).
    (c) NSO amendment. The amendments of the NSO required under Sec. 
57.503 shall be affected by the issuing agency as follows:
    (1) With respect to the additional use of SCS, upon approval or 
promulgation of the plan submitted under paragraph (a) of this section 
and upon approval or promulgation of the requirements for the system 
described in the additional SCS Report under paragraph (b) of this 
section;

[[Page 176]]

    (2) With respect to the additional use of engineering techniques, 
upon approval or promulgation of the compliance schedule required by 
paragraph (a) of this section.

 Subpart H_Waiver of Interim Requirement for Use of Continuous Emission 

                          Reduction Technology


<R05>
Sec. 57.801  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart shall govern all proceedings for the waiver of the 
interim requirement that each NSO provide for the use of constant 
controls.
    (b) In the absence of specific provisions in this subpart, and where 
appropriate, questions arising at any stage of the proceeding shall be 
resolved at the discretion of the Presiding Officer or the 
Administrator, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 57.802  Request for waiver.

    (a) General. (1) Each smelter owner requesting a waiver shall 
complete, sign, and submit appendix A (Test for Eligibility for Interim 
Waiver). Copies of appendix A may be obtained from any EPA Regional 
Administrator, or from the Director, Stationary Source Compliance 
Division (EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 
Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. Claims of confidentiality 
shall be made as provided in Sec. 57.203.
    (2) The smelter owner shall append to the completed and signed 
appendix A full copies of all documents, test results, studies, reports, 
scientific literature and assessments required by appendix A. To the 
extent that the material consists of generally available published 
material, the smelter owner may cite to the material in lieu of 
appending it to appendix A. The smelter owner shall specifically 
designate those portions of any documents relied upon and the facts or 
conclusions in appendix A to which they relate.
    (b) Effect of submitting incomplete application. (1) The 
Administrator, or a person designated by him to review applications for 
waivers, may advise the smelter owner in writing whenever he determines 
that additional information is needed in order to make the waiver 
eligibility determinations required by section 119(d)(2) of the Act. The 
smelter owner shall promptly supply such information. All additional 
information requested under this paragraph and filed in the manner 
required by paragraph (d) shall be deemed part of appendix A.
    (2) Failure to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and 
(b)(1) of this section shall be grounds for denial of the requested 
waiver.
    (c) Time for requesting waivers. Any request for a waiver must be 
submitted to the Administrator by the smelter owner at the time of the 
application for an NSO from the State or the Administrator, as the case 
may be. Where a smelter was issued a second period NSO by a State before 
these regulations went into effect, a request for a waiver shall be made 
and a completed appendix A shall be submitted, within sixty days of the 
effective date of these regulations, unless an extension is

[[Page 177]]

granted by the Administrator, or his designee, for good cause.
    (d) Submission of request. A copy of appendix A (plus attachments) 
which has been completed for the purpose of requesting a waiver of 
constant control requirements shall be filed with the Administrator, 
addressed as follows: Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division 
(EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., 
NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attn: Confidential Information Unit.
    (e) Eligibility. A smelter shall be eligible for consideration under 
this subpart only if it establishes that (1) its existing strong stream 
controls, if any, lack the capacity while in full operation to treat all 
strong stream sulfur dioxide emissions and (2) bypass of strong stream 
controls due to excess strong stream sulfur dioxide emissions cannot be 
avoided with improved operation and maintenance of existing strong 
stream controls and process equipment.
    (f) Criteria for decision. The Administrator shall grant or approve 
a waiver, whichever is appropriate, for any eligible smelter as to which 
he finds, in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in 
appendix A, that:
    (1) The higher of the two net present values of future cash flows 
completed under the two alternative sets of assumptions set forth in the 
instructions to schedule D.6 in appendix A in less than liquidation 
(salvage) value; or
    (2) The smelter's average variable costs at all relevant levels of 
production (after installation of interim constant control equipment) 
would exceed the weighted average price of smelter output for one year 
or more.


<R05>
Sec. 57.803  Issuance of tentative determination; notice.

    (a) Tentative determination. (1) The EPA staff shall formulate and 
prepare:
    (i) A ``Staff Computational Analysis,'' using the financial 
information submitted by the smelter owner under Sec. 57.802 to 
evaluate the economic circumstances of the smelter for which the waiver 
is sought;
    (ii) A tentative determination as to whether an interim requirement 
for the use of constant controls would be so costly as to necessitate 
permanent or prolonged temporary cessation of operations at the smelter 
for which the waiver is requested. The tentative determination shall 
contain a ``Proposed Report and Findings'' summarizing the conclusions 
reached in the Staff Computational Analysis, discussing the estimated 
cost of interim controls, and assessing the effect upon the smelter of 
requiring those controls. The tentative determination shall also contain 
a proposed recommendation that the waiver be granted or denied, based 
upon the Proposed Report and Findings, and stating any additional 
considerations supporting the proposed recommendation. This tentative 
determination shall be a public document.
    (2) In preparing the Proposed Report and Findings, the EPA staff 
shall attempt to the maximum extent feasible to avoid revealing 
confidential information which, if revealed, might damage the legitimate 
business interests of the applicant. The preceding sentence 
notwithstanding, the tentative determination shall be accompanied by a 
listing of all materials considered by EPA staff in developing the 
tentative determination. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 57.814(a), 
full copies of all such materials shall be included in the 
administrative record under Sec. 57.814, except that, to the extent the 
material consists of published material which is generally available, 
full citations to that material may be given instead.
    (b) Public notice. Public notice of EPA's tentative determination to 
grant or deny an application for a waiver shall be given by:
    (1) Publication at least once in a daily newspaper of general 
circulation in the area in which the smelter is located; and
    (2) Posting in the principal office of the municipality in which the 
smelter is located.
    (c) Individual notice. Individual notice of EPA's tentative 
determination to grant or deny an application for a waiver shall be 
mailed to the smelter owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, 
and to the air pollution control agency for the State in which the 
smelter is located.

[[Page 178]]

    (d) Request for individual notice. EPA shall mail notice of its 
tentative determination to grant or deny an application for waiver to 
any person upon request. Each such request shall be submitted to the 
Administrator in writing, shall state that the request is for individual 
notice of tentative determination to grant or deny any application for a 
waiver under section 119(d) of the Clean Air Act, and shall describe the 
notice or types of notices desired (e.g., all notices, notices for a 
particular Region, notices for a particular State, notice for a 
particular city).
    (e) Form of notice. The notice of tentative determination required 
to be distributed under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section 
shall include, in addition to any other materials, the following:
    (1) A summary of the information contained in appendix A;
    (2) The tentative determination prepared under paragraph (a) of this 
section: Provided, that except in the case of the smelter owner, a 
summary of the basis for the grant or denial of the waiver may be 
provided in lieu of the formal determinations required by paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section;
    (3) A brief description of the procedures set forth in Sec. 57.804 
for requesting a public hearing on the waiver request, including a 
statement that such request must be filed within 30 days of the date of 
the notice;
    (4) A statement that written comments on the tentative determination 
submitted to EPA within 60 days of the date of the notice will be 
considered by EPA in making a final decision on the application; and
    (5) The location of the administrative record and the location at 
which interested persons may obtain further information on the tentative 
determination, including a copy of the index to the record, the 
tentative determination prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, 
and any other nonconfidential record materials.


<R05>
Sec. 57.804  Request for hearing; request to participate in hearing.

    (a) Request for hearing. Within 30 days of the date of publication 
or receipt of the notice required by Sec. 57.803, any person may 
request the Administrator to hold a hearing on the tentative 
determination by submitting a written request containing the following:
    (1) Identification of the person requesting the hearing and his 
interest in the proceeding;
    (2) A statement of any objections to the tentative determination; 
and
    (3) A statement of the issues which such person proposes to raise

effect on the smelter of the requirement for use of constant controls, 
or (2) the Administrator determines in his discretion that a hearing is 
necessary or appropriate the Administrator shall give written notice of 
his determination to each person requesting such hearing and the smelter 
owner, and shall provide public notice of his determination in 
accordance with Sec. 57.803(b). If the Administrator determines that a 
request filed under paragraph (a) of this section does not comply with 
the requirements of paragraph (a) or does not present genuine issues, he 
shall be given written notice of his decision to deny a hearing to the 
person requesting the hearing.
    (c) Form of notice of hearing. Each notice of hearing disseminated 
under paragraph (b) of this section shall contain:
    (1) A statement of the time and place of the hearing;
    (2) A statement identifying the place at which the official record 
on the application for waiver is located, the hours during which it will 
be open for public inspection, and the documents contained in the record 
as of the date of the notice of hearing;
    (3) The due date for filing a written request to participate in the 
hearing under paragraph (d) of this section;

practicable, but in no event later than two weeks before the scheduled 
date of the hearing, the Hearing Clerk shall make available to the 
public and shall mail to each person who asked to participate in the 
hearing a hearing schedule.
    (e) Effect of denial of or absence of request for hearing. If no 
request for a hearing is made under this section, or if all such 
requests are denied under paragraph (b) of this section, the tentative 
determination issued under Sec. 57.803 shall be treated procedurally as 
if it were a recommended decision issued under Sec. 57.811(b)(2), 
except that for purposes of Sec. Sec. 57.812 and 57.813 the term 
``hearing participant'' shall be construed to mean the smelter owner and 
any person who submitted comments under Sec. 57.803(e)(4).


<R05>
Sec. 57.805  Submission of written comments on tentative determination.

    (a) Main comments. Each person who has filed a request to

Sec. 57.807  Hearing.

    (a) Composition of hearing panel. The Presiding Officer shall 
preside at the hearing held under this subpart. An EPA panel shall also 
take part in the hearing. In general, the membership of the panel shall 
consist of EPA employees having special expertise in areas related to 
the issues to be addressed at the hearing, including economists and 
engineers. For this reason, the membership of the panel may change as 
different issues are presented for discussion.
    (b) Additional hearing participants. Either before or during the 
hearing, the Presiding Officer, after consultation with the panel, may 
request that a person not then scheduled to participate in the hearing 
(including an EPA employee or a person identified by any scheduled 
hearing participant as having knowledge concerning the issues raised for 
discussion at the hearing) make a presentation or make himself available 
for cross-examination at the hearing.
    (c) Questioning of hearing participants. The panel members may 
question any person participating in the hearing. Cross-examination by 
persons other than panel members shall not be permitted at this stage of 
the proceeding except where the Presiding Officer determines, after 
consultation with the panel, that circumstances compel such cross-
examination. However, persons in the hearing audience, including other 
hearing participants, may submit written questions to the Presiding 
Officer for the Presiding Officer to ask the participants, and the 
Presiding Officer may, after consultation with the panel, and in his 
sole discretion, ask these questions.
    (d) Submission of additional material. Participants in the hearing 
shall submit for the hearing record such additional material as the 
hearing panel may request within 10 days following the close of the 
hearing, or such other period of time as is ordered by the Presiding 
Officer. Participants may also submit additional information for the 
hearing record on their own accord within 10 days after the close of the 
hearing.
    (e) Transcript. A verbatim transcript shall be made of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 57.808  Opportunity for cross-examination.

    (a) Request for cross-examination. After the close of the panel 
hearing conducted under this part, any participant in that hearing may 
submit a written request for cross-examination. The request shall be 
received by EPA within one week after a full transcript of the hearing 
becomes available and shall specify:
    (1) The disputed issue(s) of material fact as to which cross-
examination is requested. This shall include an explanation of why the 
questions at issue are factual, rather than of an analytical or policy 
nature; the extent to which they are in dispute in the light of the 
record made thus far, and the extent to which and why they can 
reasonably be considered material to the decision on the application for 
a waiver; and
    (2) The person(s) the participant desires to cross-examine, and an 
estimate

[[Page 181]]

of the time necessary. This shall include a statement as to why the 
cross-examination requested can be expected to result in full and true 
disclosure resolving the issue of material fact involved.
    (b) Order granting or denying request for cross-examination. As 
expeditiously as practicable after receipt of all requests for cross-
examination under paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer, 
after consultation with the hearing panel, shall issue an order either 
granting or denying each such request, which shall be disseminated to 
all persons requesting cross-examination and all persons to be cross-
examined. If any request for cross-examination is granted, the order 
shall specify:
    (1) The issues as to which cross-examination is granted;
    (2) The persons to be cross-examined on each issue;
    (3) The persons allowed to conduct cross-examination;
    (4) Time limits for the examination of witnesses; and
    (5) The date, time and place of the supplementary hearing at which 
cross-examination shall take place. In issuing this ruling, the 
Presiding Officer may determine that one or more participants have the 
same or similar interests and that to prevent unduly repetitious cross-
examination, they should be required to choose a single representative 
for purposes of cross-examination. In such a case, the order shall 
simply assign time for cross-examination by that single representative 
without identifying the representative further.
    (c) Supplementary hearing. The Presiding Officer and at least one 
member of the original hearing panel shall preside at the supplementary 
hearing. During the course of the hearing, the Presiding Officer shall 
have authority to modify any order issued under paragraph (b) of this 
section. A verbatim transcript shall be made of this hearing.
    (d) Alternatives to cross-examination. (1) No later than the time 
set for requesting cross-examination, a hearing participant may request 
that alternative methods of clarifying the record (such as the submittal 
of additional written information) be used in lieu of or in addition to 
cross-examination. The Presiding Officer shall issue an order granting 
or denying such request at the time he issues (or would have issued) an 
order under paragraph (b) of this section. If the request is granted, 
the order shall specify the alternative provided and any other relevant 
information (e.g., the due date for submitting written information).
    (2) In passing on any request for cross-examination submitted under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer may, as a 
precondition to ruling on the merits of such request, require that 
alternative means of clarifying the record be used whether or not a 
request to do so has been made under the preceding paragraph. The person 
requesting cross-examination shall have one week to comment on the 
results of utilizing such alternative means, following which the 
Presiding Officer, as soon as practicable, shall issue an order granting 
or denying such person's request for cross-examination.

Sec. 57.810  Filing of briefs, proposed findings, and proposed 

recommendations.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer, each hearing 
participant may, within 20 days after reply comments are submitted under 
Sec. 57.805(b), or if a supplementary hearing for the purpose of cross-
examination has been held under Sec. 57.808(c), within 20 days after 
the transcript of such supplemental hearing becomes available or if 
alternative methods of clarifying the record have been used under Sec. 
57.808(d), within 20 days after the alternative methods have been 
employed, file with the Hearing Clerk and serve upon all other hearing 
participants proposed findings and proposed recommendations to replace 
in whole or in part the findings and recommendations contained in the 
tentative determination. Any such person may also file, at the same 
time, a brief in support of his proposals, together with references to 
relevant pages of transcript and to relevant exhibits. Within 10 days 
thereafter each participant may file a reply brief concerning 
alternative proposals. Oral argument may be held at the discretion of 
the Presiding Officer on motion of any hearing participant or sua 
sponte.


<R05>
Sec. 57.811  Recommended decision.

    As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing, one or 
more responsible employees of the Agency shall evaluate the record for 
preparation of a recommended decision and shall prepare and file a 
recommended decision with the Hearing Clerk. The employee(s) preparing 
the decision will generally be members of the hearing panel and may 
include the Presiding

[[Page 183]]

Officer. Such employee(s) may consult with and receive assistance from 
any member of the hearing panel in drafting a recommended decision and 
may also delegate the preparation of the recommended decision to the 
panel or to any member or members of it. This decision shall contain the 
same elements as the tentative determination. After the recommended 
decision has been filed, the Hearing Clerk shall serve a copy of such 
decision on each hearing participant and upon the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 57.812  Appeal from or review of recommended decision.

    (a) Exceptions. (1) Within 20 days after service of the recommended 
decision, any hearing participant may take exception to any matter set 
forth in such decision or to any adverse order or ruling of the 
Presiding Officer prior to or during the hearing to which such 
participant objected, and may appeal such exceptions to the 
Administrator by filing them in writing with the Hearing Clerk. Such 
exceptions shall contain alternative findings and recommendations, 
together with references to the relevant pages of the record and 
recommended decision. A copy of each document taking exception to the 
recommended decision shall be served upon every other hearing 
participant. Within the same period of time each party filing exceptions 
shall file with the Administrator and shall serve upon all hearing 
participants a brief concerning each of the exceptions being appealed. 
Each brief shall include page references to the relevant portions of the 
record and to the recommended decision.
    (2) Within 10 days of the service of exceptions and briefs under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any hearing participant may file and 
serve a reply brief responding to exceptions or arguments raised by any 
other hearing participant together with references to the relevant 
portions of the record, recommended decision, or opposing brief. Reply 
briefs shall not, however, raise additional exceptions.
    (b) Sua sponte review by the Administrator. Whenever the 
Administrator determines sua sponte to review a recommended decision, 
notice of such intention shall be served upon the parties by the Hearing 
Clerk within 30 days after the date of service of the recommended 
decision. Such notice shall include a statement of issues to be briefed 
by the hearing participants and a time schedule for the service and 
filing of briefs.
    (c) Scope of appeal or review. The appeal of the recommended 
decision shall be limited to the issues raised by the appellant, except 
when the Administrator determines that additional issues should be 
briefed or argued. If the Administrator determines that briefing or 
argument of additional issues is warranted, all hearing participants 
shall be given reasonable written notice of such determination to permit 
preparation of adequate argument.
    (d) Argument before the Administrator. The Administrator may, upon 
request by a party or sua sponte, set a matter for oral argument. The 
time and place for such oral argument shall be assigned after giving 
consideration to the convenience of the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 57.813  Final decision.

    (a) After review. As soon as practicable after all appeal or other 
review proceedings have been completed, the Administrator shall issue 
his final decision. Such a final decision shall include the same 
elements as the recommended decision, as well as any additional reasons 
supporting his decisions on exceptions filed by hearing participants. 
The final decision may accept or reject all or part of the recommended 
decision. The Administrator may consult with the Presiding Officer, 
members of the hearing panel or any other EPA employee in preparing his 
final decision. The Hearing Clerk shall file a copy of the decision on 
all hearing participants.
    (b) In the absence of review. If no party appeals a recommended 
decision to the Administrator and if the Administrator does not review 
it sua sponte, he shall be deemed to have adopted the recommended 
decision as the final decision of the Agency upon the expiration of the 
time for filing any exceptions under Sec. 57.812(a).
    (c) Timing of judicial review. For purposes of judicial review, 
final Agency action on a request for a waiver of the

[[Page 184]]

interim requirement that each NSO provide for the use of constant 
controls shall not occur until EPA approves or disapproves the issuance 
of an NSO to the source requesting such a waiver.


<R05>

                         1. General Instructions

    1.1 Purpose of the application. This application provides financial 
reporting schedules and the accompanying instructions for EPA's 
determination of eligibility for a nonferrous smelter order (NSO), and 
for a waiver of the interim constant controls requirement of an NSO. 
Although the determination of eligibility for an NSO is prerequisite for 
the determination of a waiver, appendix A, as a matter of convenience to 
applicants, includes both the NSO and waiver tests and reporting 
schedules.
    In order to support an NSO eligibility determination, the applicant 
must submit operating and financial data as specified by the schedules 
included in this application. Specific instructions for completing each 
schedule are provided in subsequent sections of the instructions. In 
general, applicants must provide:
    (a) Annual income statements, balance sheets and supporting data 
covering the five most recent fiscal years for the smelter for which the 
NSO requested.
    (b) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income 
from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter 
operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated 
smelter operations without any sulfur dioxide air pollution control 
facilities that have not been installed as of the NSO application date.
    (c) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income 
from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter 
operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated 
smelter operations with expected additional sulfur dioxide control 
facilities required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission 
limitation.
    (d) For smelters applying for a waiver of interim constant controls, 
forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, and capital 
investments for the firm's smelter operations prepared on the basis of 
two alternative assumptions: (1) Installation of additional pollution 
control facilities required to comply with interim constant control 
requirements, no installation of any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls 
that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the 
issuance of an NSO, and closure of the smelter after January 1, 1988; 
and (2) installation of additional pollution control facilities required 
to comply with interim constant control requirements, installation of 
any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls required to comply with the 
smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued 
operation of the smelter after January 1, 1988.
    1.2 NSO financial tests. EPA will use separate tests to determine 
eligibility for an NSO and to evaluate applications for a waiver of the 
interim constant control requirement. The two tests for NSO eligibility 
employ a present value approach for determining the reasonable 
availability of constant control technology that will enable an 
applicant to achieve full compliance with its SIP sulfur dioxide 
emission limitation. The tests for the waiver of the interim constant 
control requirements employ variable costing and discounted cash flow 
standards for evaluating an applicant's economic capability to implement 
those requirements.
    1.2.1 NSO Eligibility Tests. Each applicant must establish that the 
system of production and/or constant control technology that will enable 
the smelter to achieve full compliance with its SIP SO<INF>2</INF> 
emission limitation

[[Page 186]]

standard is not reasonably available. An applicant will determine 
financial eligibility for an NSO by passing at least one of the 
following two tests.
    (a) Profit Protection Test. The smelter will experience a reduction 
in pre-tax profits of 50 percent or more after undertaking the required 
installation of constant controls.
    (b) Rate of Return Test. The smelter will earn a rate of return on 
historical net investment, expressed in constant dollars, below the 
industry average cost of capital after undertaking the required 
installation of constant controls.
    1.2.2 Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls. Applicants that do not 
have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are 
not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all 
strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of 
the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant 
controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a 
temporary waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not 
already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in 
this application that the imposition of such control requirements would 
economically necessitate closure of the smelter facility for a period of 
one year or longer. The economic justification for a non-permanent 
closure under this temporary waiver test is defined as a situation in 
which the smelter's projected operating revenues for one or more years 
during which the NSO is in effect are inadequate to cover variable 
operating costs anticipated after installing the required interim 
control technology. Temporary waivers will be granted for only the 
period of time over which applicants can establish an inability by the 
firm to cover its variable operating costs. Interim control waiver 
requests based on the smelter's projected inability to earn adequate 
income after installation of interim pollution control equipment will be 
subject to the permanent waiver test.
    1.2.3 Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls. Applicants that do not 
have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are 
not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all 
strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of 
the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant 
controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a 
permanent waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not 
already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in 
this application that an imposition of such control requirements would 
necessitate permanent closure of the smelter. Economic justification for 
a permanent closure is defined as a situation in which the present value 
of future cash flows anticipated from the smelter after installing the 
required interim control technology is less than the smelter's current 
salvage value under an orderly plan of liquidation. Future cash flows 
are determined under two alternative assumptions. The higher present 
value of cash flows computed under these assumptions is then compared to 
salvage value.
    1.2.4 EPA Contact for NSO Inquiries. Inquiries concerning this 
portion of the requirements for NSO application should be addressed to 
Laxmi M. Kesari, Environmental Protection Agency, EN 341, 1200 
Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.
    1.2.5 Certification. The NSO Certification Statement must be signed 
by an authorized officer of the applicant firm.
    1.3 Confidentiality. Applicants may request that information 
contained in this application be treated as confidential. Agency 
regulations concerning claims of confidentiality of business information 
are contained in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B (41 FR 36902 et seq., 
September 1, 1976, as amended by 43 FR 39997 et seq., September 8, 
1978). The regulations provide that a business may, if it desires, 
assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the 
information furnished to EPA. The claim must be made at the same time 
the applicable information is submitted. The manner of asserting such 
claims is specified in 40 CFR 2.203(b). Information covered by such a 
claim will be handled by the Agency in accordance with procedures set 
forth in the subpart B regulations. EPA will not disclose information on 
a business that has made a claim of confidentiality, except to the 
extent of and in accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. However, if 
no claim of confidentiality is made when information is furnished to 
EPA, the information may be made available to the public without notice 
to the business.

                   2. NSO Financial Reporting Overview

    2.1 Revenue and Cost Assignment. The amounts assigned to operations 
of the smelter subject to this NSO application should include (1) 
revenues and costs directly attributable to the smelter's operating 
activities and (2) indirect operating costs shared with other segments 
of the firm to the extent that a specific causal and beneficial 
relationship can be identified for the allocation of such costs to the 
smelter. Do not allocate revenues and costs associated with central 
administrative activities for which specific causal and beneficial 
relationships to the activities of the smelter cannot be established. 
Nonallocable items include, but are not restricted to, amounts such as 
dividend and interest income on centrally administered portfolio 
investments, central corporate administrative office expenses and, 
except for schedules supporting the Profit Protection

[[Page 187]]

Test, interest on long-term debt financing arrangements. Provide a 
detailed explanation of amounts classified as nontraceable on a separate 
schedule and attach as part of Exhibit B.
    2.2 Transfer Prices on Affiliated Part Transactions. Certain 
transactions by the smelter subject to an NSO application may reflect 
sales to or purchases from ``affiliated'' customers or suppliers with 
whom the smelter has a common bond of ownership and/or managerial 
control. In preparing this application, affiliated party transactions 
shall be defined as transactions with any entity that the firm, or its 
owners, controls directly or indirectly either through an ownership of 
10 percent or more of the entity's voting interests or through an 
exercise of managerial responsibility. Applicants must attach as part of 
Exhibit B supporting schedules explaining the pricing policies 
established on affiliated party transactions incorporated in the 
financial reporting schedules.
    Prices on inter-segment material and product transfers within a 
firm, or on external purchases from and sales to other affiliated 
suppliers and customers, may differ from the prices on comparable 
transactions with unaffiliated suppliers and customers. In this event, 
applicants also must present in the Exhibit B supporting schedules and 
incorporate in the NSO financial reporting schedules appropriate 
adjustments for restating affiliated party transactions. Affiliated 
party transactions must be restated at either (a) equivalent prices on 
comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties if such price 
quotations can be obtained or (b) prices that provide the selling entity 
with a normal profit margin above its cost of sales if a meaningful 
comparison with unaffiliated transaction prices cannot be established.
    A ``normal'' profit margin is defined as the gross operating profit 
per dollar of operating revenue that will provide an average after-tax 
rate of return on permanent capital (total assets less current 
liabilities). This average rate of return is defined differently for the 
historical and forecast periods. The applicant must use a rate of return 
of 8.0 percent for the historical period. This figure is based on a 
historical average earned rate of return for the nonferrous metals 
industry. \1\ EPA may update this figure periodically. The updates will 
be available in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT 
noted in the Federal Register. For the forecast period, the applicant 
must use a rate of return equal to the current weighted average cost of 
capital for the nonferrous metals industry, as computed in Section 2.6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The derivation of this figure is explained in two memoranda to 
EPA (Item Nos. II-A-1 and IV-A-6a in EPA Docket No. A-82-35).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Forecast smelting charges for integrated smelters can be computed 
from forecast market smelting charges. Integrated copper smelters may 
use as the basis of their forecast revenues the forecast copper smelting 
charges provided by EPA, adjusted as described in Section 2.4.1. An 
applicant may submit other forecasts, providing the forecast methodology 
is in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 and fully documented 
as part of Exhibit B.
    2.3 Forecasting Requirements. NSO applicants must provide the Agency 
with financial forecasts in Schedules B.1 through B.6 and C.1 through 
C.2. Applicants requesting either a temporary or permanent waiver from 
interim constant control requirements also must provide an additional 
set of financial forecasts in Schedules D.1 through D.4.
    2.3.1 Forecast Period. The forecast period must include at least two 
full years following completion and startup of the required pollution 
control system. The forecast period shall be from 1984 through 1990 for 
an NSO application filed in 1984. If an application is filed in a later 
year, the 1984 through 1990 period should be adjusted accordingly. All 
references in this appendix to the period 1984 through 1990 should be 
interpreted accordingly.
    2.3.2 Forecast Adjustment by Control Case. Some line items that have 
the same title in several schedules may contain different information 
because they are based on different assumptions regarding pollution 
controls. Production interruptions or curtailments due to the 
installation of pollution control facilities may require adjustments to 
certain revenue and cost estimates in the respective control cases. For 
example, production curtailments associated with supplementary control 
systems may be the basis for the pre-control case, yet are eliminated 
when constant controls replace supplementary control systems in the 
constant controls case. The application of pollution control techniques 
that involve process changes in the smelter's operations (e.g., 
conversion to flash smelting) also may require specific forecasts by 
applications of associated impacts on incremental operating revenues and 
costs.
    2.3.3 Nominal Dollar Basis. Applicants must make their financial 
forecasts in terms of nominal dollars. Forecasts of selected parameters 
provided by EPA will furnish guidelines to an applicant in preparing the 
required cost and revenue estimates. In particular, copper smelting 
charges provided in nominal-dollar terms must be used directly by the 
applicant as given; i.e., the stipulated charge estimates should not be 
inflated.
    2.3.4 Tolling Service Equivalent Basis. Applicants must express all 
revenue forecasts on a tolling service equivalent basis. Thus,

[[Page 188]]

forecast revenues are computed as the product of the forecast quantity 
of processed concentrate, the forecast average product grade of the 
concentrate (the percent of metal in the concentrate), and the forecast 
smelting charge. Smelters that are not tolling smelters and that do not 
use the copper smelting charges provided by EPA (as described in Section 
2.4.1) can forecast a smelting charge from forecast product grade of the 
concentrate, percent recovery, and product and concentrate prices. The 
forecast prices and derivation of the smelting charge must be in 
accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5, and the methodology must 
be fully documented in Exhibit B.
    2.4 EPA Furnished Forecast Data. In making projection for the period 
1984 through 1990, applicants must, except as noted below, use the 
indices provided by EPA. The table below presents yearly values for each 
index (expressed as annual percentage rates of change) to be used by 
smelters applying for an NSO before January 1, 1985. If forecasts are 
needed for 1991 and EPA has not provided new forecasts, applicants 
should use the Data Resources, Inc. forecasts for 1991 (Docket Item No. 
IV-A-6c) and the average of CRU's forecasts for 1989 and 1990 (expressed 
in 1991 dollars).

\1\ Reference charge for calculating smelter-specific copper smelting charges as described in Section 2.4.1.
 

    2.4.1 Copper smelting charge. EPA will supply a forecast of 
reference copper smelting charges. These charges, which are f.o.b. U.S. 
mine, are based on an estimate of export smelting charges and on the 
differential value of copper in the U.S. and the world market. They must 
be used in forecasting unaffiliated party revenues for the period 
following the expiration of existing contracts and in forecasting 
affiliated party revenues for the entire forecast period. The applicant 
may submit its own smelting charge forecast for the post-contract 
period, provided that such forecast is in accordance with the guidelines 
in Section 2.5 and fully documented and substantiated as part of Exhibit 
B.
    The EPA forecast export charge represents the world market copper 
smelting charge with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange (LME) 
copper price. This charge serves as the reference charge for the 
applicant copper smelter in calculating its smelting charges. Applicant 
copper smelters must derive their smelting charges from this world 
market charge as described in paragraph (a) below.
    The applicant may adjust the derived smelter-specific smelting 
charge to account for other factors, provided the adjustments are fully 
documented as part of Exhibit B. An example of such a factor is the unit 
deduction for metallurgical losses in smelting. Adjustment for this 
factor is discussed in paragraph (b) below.
    (a) The derivation of a smelter-specific smelting charge from the 
world market charge is based on assumptions regarding transportation 
costs and the U.S. producer-world copper price differential. The EPA 
forecast export charge is the forecast smelting charge available at a 
Japanese smelter, with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange copper 
price. The charge includes no freight costs, which must be paid by the 
mine. A U.S. smelter determines its smelting charge to a mine by meeting 
the combined world market smelting charge, adjusted to reflect copper 
valued at the U.S. producer price, and the transportation charge from 
the mine to the Japanese smelter. This combined price is the highest 
that a mine is willing to pay for smelting.
    The smelter's net smelting charge is equal to the combined world 
smelting charge, adjusted to the U.S. producer price for copper (i.e., 
the export forecast charge plus the U.S. producer price premium), and 
the transportation cost between the mine and a Far East smelter, minus 
the cost of transporting the concentrate between the mine and the 
applicant smelter.
    The applicant smelter's net smelting charge for concentrate from an 
individual mine is computed by first adding the U.S. producer Price-LME 
world price differential to the EPA-supplied forecast. The cost of 
transporting copper from the U.S. mine to the Far East is then added to 
this figure. The

[[Page 189]]

net smelting charge is obtained by subtracting from this total the cost 
of transporting copper from the mine to the applicant smelter. In making 
these calculations, an applicant must supply (and fully document in 
Exhibit B), the freight cost between the mine and the Far East and 
between the mine and the smelter. This freight cost must be converted to 
nominal dollars of the respective forecast years by applying the GNP 
percentage price change forecasts supplied by EPA or smelter-provided 
forecasts of transportation price changes. The smelter-provided 
forecasts of transportation price changes must comply with guidelines 
regarding such forecasts in Section 2.5.
    An applicant must use a 3 cent per pound U.S. producer price premium 
(relative to the LME price) in calculating the smelter's net smelting 
charge. The applicant may substitute its own forecasts of the U.S. 
producer price premium if it can substantiate such forecasts in 
accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 regarding applicant-
provided smelting charge forecasts of principal products. All supporting 
documentation for such applicant-supplied forecasts must be supplied in 
Exhibit B. Any updates of the producer price premium will be available 
in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT noted in the 
Federal Register.
    The following two representative examples illustrate this 
methodology for making the transportation and U. S. producer price 
premium adjustment.
    (1) The applicant smelter, located in Arizona, obtains concentrate 
from an adjacent mine. The freight charge from mine to smelter is zero. 
The mine is willing to pay the applicant smelter an amount no higher 
than the sum of the world market smelting charge (adjusted for the 
copper value differential) and the transportation cost of shipping 
copper from the mine to the Far East. This combined cost is the net 
charge received by the applicant smelter. If the export smelting charge 
is 12 cents per pound and the freight cost between the mine and the Far 
East is 13 cents per pound, the applicant smelter would calculate a net 
smelting charge equal to 28 cents: 12 cents plus 3 cents (for the U.S. 
producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight cost between the 
mine and the Far East).
    (2) The applicant smelter obtains concentrate from a nonadjacent 
mine. The mine will pay a charge no higher than the total market 
smelting charge, valued at the U.S. producer price, and the 
transportation costs between the mine and a Far East smelter. The 
applicant's net smelting charge is equal to this combined cost minus the 
transportation costs for shipping the concentrate between mine and 
applicant smelter.
    Suppose that the mine to Far East freight charge is 13 cents per 
pound and the mine to applicant smelter freight charge is 4 cents per 
pound. If the export smelting charge is 12 cents per pound, the net 
smelting charge is equal to 24 cents per pound: 12 cents plus 3 cents 
(for the U.S. producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight 
cost to the Far East) minus 4 cents (for the freight cost to the 
applicant smelter).
    (b) The EPA forecast charges are based on a one unit deduction for 
metallurgical losses. This means that if a concentrate grades 25 percent 
copper, the mine is only credited with 24 percent for metal return. The 
one unit deduction on 25 percent concentrate is equivalent to a 96 
percent payment for contained copper. Should a smelter recover less than 
96 percent, its revenue would be less than the EPA forecast smelting 
charge. Should a smelter recover more than 96 percent, its revenue would 
be greater than the EPA forecast smelting charge.
    2.4.2 Indices (Annual Percentage Changes). These indices, which are 
expressed as annual percentage rate changes in price (wages, energy 
prices, and GNP price deflator) must be used only for estimating the 
rate of price increases for the forecast period following the expiration 
of the applicant's current contracts. The applicant may use alternative 
forecasts of annual percentage changes for the forecast period following 
the expiration of current contracts, if justification is provided. Any 
such alternative forecasts must be prepared by a widely-recognized 
forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the 
forecaster relied upon by EPA. In addition, the documentation of these 
forecasts must be comparable to that provided by EPA's forecaster.
    The wage indices are to be applied to wage paid to manufacturing 
labor. The energy price indices are to be applied to prices of the 
respective energy products. The GNP price deflators are to be applied to 
prices for non-metal, non-labor, and non-energy inputs.
    2.5 Applicant Generated Forecasts. Within the specified limitations, 
applicants may submit a method of forecasting smelting charges and by-
product, co-product and other prices. The method selected must be 
explained and unit prices or costs provided where applicable. The 
forecast elements must be compatible with an applicant's historical cost 
and revenue elements to permit direct comparisons of historical and 
forecast data. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B appropriate 
schedules explaining variances between forecast and historical unit 
costs for the smelter.
    Forecasts of the smelting charges of the smelter's principal product 
(i.e., copper, lead, zinc, etc.) may be prepared either by an 
independent forecasting authority or by the smelter's in-house 
personnel. If the forecasts are prepared by an independent forecasting 
authority, the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) The 
forecasting authority must

[[Page 190]]

have expertise comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA. 
(2) As much documentation of the forecasting methodology as can 
reasonably be obtained must be made available to EPA. Such documentation 
must, at a minimum, be comparable to the documentation supporting EPA 
smelting charge forecasts. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Documentation of the EPA forecasts is provided as part of Item 
NO. IV-A-2 in EPA Docket No. A-82-35.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the smelting charge forecasts are prepared by in-house personnel, 
the following conditions must be met: (1) The in-house forecasts must be 
certified as being based on sound methodology by an independent 
forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the 
forecaster who prepared the EPA-supplied smelting charges. The 
independent forecasting authority shall also provide a brief explanation 
of the basis for the conclusion reached in the certification. (2) The 
smelter owner shall provide EPA with the documentation of the 
forecasting methodology employed, which must at a minimum be comparable 
to the extent of documentation supporting EPA's smelting charge 
forecasts. The smelter owner shall also make available upon request by 
EPA such additional documentation of the methodology and underlying data 
as EPA considers appropriate for evaluation of the forecasts.
    Forecasts of freight cost changes, which are applied to the freight 
costs used in calculating a smelter's net smelting charges, must be 
prepared by a widely-recognized forecasting authority. The forecaster's 
expertise must be comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by 
EPA in forecasting the annual percentage changes in wages, energy 
prices, and GNP. The documentation of these forecasts must be comparable 
to that provided by EPA's forecaster.
    To the maximum extent practicable, by-product, co-product and (when 
applicable) unaffiliated smelting charges must be stated at market 
prices adjusted to f.o.b. smelter. Adjustments of these pricing bases 
must be made to reflect differences in grades and types of production. 
All adjustments must be consistent with expected sales, grades and types 
of concentrate processed. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B 
schedules describing and explaining the methods used to forecast these 
revenue items and the adjustments required for these revenue forecasts.
    Applicants must explain fully any changes from the historical data 
that are required to forecast labor productivity, ore-concentrate grade 
and composition, materials and energy consumption per unit of output, 
yield rates and other physical input/output relationships.
    Existing contractual terms must be used in forecasting those sales 
or input costs or prices to which the applicant is committed by 
contracts. The use of contract-dictated prices must be disclosed and 
supported by attaching as part of Exhibit B the terms and duration of 
labor and other supplier arrangements.
    Cost of compliance estimates need not be to the accuracy of final 
design/bid estimates; feasibility grade estimates will be acceptable. 
Updated cost of compliance estimates used in internal five year plans or 
specially prepared estimates of costs of compliance will generally be 
satisfactory.
    2.6 Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Nonferrous Metal Producers. 
The industry average cost of capital is a weighted average of the rates 
of return for equity and debt. Its components are the interest rate and 
the return on equity specific to the nonferrous metals industry.
    2.6.1 Computation.\3\ The applicant must compute the cost of capital 
according to the following formula:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The derivation of the formula and the basis of the parameters 
are explained in two memoranda to EPA (Item Nos. II-A-1 and IV-A-6a in 
EPA Docket No. A-82-35).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
R = (0.65xE)+(0.182xI)

where

R = weighted average cost of capital
E = return on equity
I = interest rate.

The components are calculated as follows.
    (a) Return on equity for the nonferrous metals industry. The 20 year 
Treasury bond yield to maturity plus a risk premium of 8.6 percent.
    (b) Interest Rate. The 20 year Treasury bond yield to maturity plus 
a risk premium of 3.0 percent.
    (c) Source of the 20 Year Treasury bond yield. Federal Reserve 
Bulletin, most recent monthly issue. Use the average yield for the most 
recent full month.
    2.6.2 Discount Factor. The discount factor corresponding to the 
weighted average cost of capital for any forecast year is computed 
according to the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09NO91.029

where

DF = discount factor
R = weighted average cost of capital
N = the number of years in the future (e.g., for the applicant applying 
in 1984, N = for the forecast year 1985).

    The horizon value, which is described in Section 2.7, is computed as 
of 1990, the end of the detailed forecast period. The discount factor to 
be applied to the horizon value is

[[Page 191]]

the same as for any other 1990 figure. For example, if the application 
is made in 1984, the value of N is 7.
    2.7 Horizon Value. The horizon value is the present value of a 
stream of cash flows or net income for 15 years beyond the last forecast 
year. Applicants must compute the horizon value by capitalizing the 
average forecast value of the last two forecast years using the current 
real weighted cost of capital. The line item instructions for schedules 
having a horizon value entry will specify the values to be capitalized.
    The applicant averages the values of the last two years after 
expressing both values in terms of the last year's dollars. The two-year 
average value is then multiplied by 9.6. This is the factor associated 
with capitalizing a 15 year value stream at the current real weighted 
cost of capital of 6.2 percent.
    Applicants must use a separate schedule to calculate the horizon 
value for the Rate of Return Test and the Interim Controls Test 
(Schedule C.5 and D.7, respectively). These separate schedules adjust 
for potential overstatements in the horizon value cash flows that may be 
caused by control equipment depreciation reported for tax purposes.
    2.8 Data Entry
    2.8.1 Rounding. All amounts (including both dollar values and 
physical units) reported in the schedules and exhibits accompanying this 
application must be rounded to the nearest thousand and expressed in 
thousands of dollars or units unless otherwise indicated in the 
instructions.
    2.8.2 Estimates. Where an applicant's records cannot produce the 
specific data required by this application, the use of estimates will be 
allowed if a meaningful estimate can be made without significant 
distortion of the reported results. Data estimates must be supported by 
attaching on a separate sheet of paper as a part of Exhibit B an 
explanation identifying where such estimates are used and showing 
explicitly how the estimates were made.
    2.8.3 Missing Data. Applicants must provide, where applicable, all 
operating and financial data requested by this application. Only 
substantially complete applications can be accepted for processing by 
the Agency. Questions concerning data entries for which information is 
not provided by or cannot reasonably be estimated from the applicant's 
existing accounting records should be addressed to the EPA Contact for 
NSO Inquiries.
    2.8.4 Historical Period. The annual data requested in the historical 
schedules, Schedules A.1 through A.4, must be reported for each of the 
five fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which this 
application is filed. The historical period shall be from fiscal years 
1979 through 1983 for an NSO application filed in 1984. If an 
application is filed in a later year, the references in this appendix to 
the period 1979 through 1983 should be interpreted accordingly.
    2.9 Use of schedules. All applicants must complete Schedules A.1 
through A.4, which record historical revenues, cost, and capital 
investment data. These schedules will be used by EPA to assist in 
evaluating forecast data. Completion of the remaining schedules depends 
on the test required of the applicant.
    2.9.1 NSO Eligibility. An NSO applicant must pass one of the 
following two tests and complete the corresponding schedules.
    (a) Profit Protection Test. The applicant must complete Schedules 
B.1 through B.7 to determine eligibility under the Profit Protection 
Test. Schedules B.1 and B.2 report the base case (without constant 
controls) revenue and cost forecast, respectively, and Schedule B.3 
summarizes Schedules B.1 and B.2. Base case production forecasts should 
reflect any production curtailments associated with interim controls 
currently (preforecast) installed on smelters. Schedules B.4 and B.5 
report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant 
controls case, and Schedule B.6 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the 
Profit Protection Test.
    Schedule B.7 presents the calculations for the Profit Protection 
Test. The applicant enters the forecast profits from Schedules B.3 and 
B.6. The present value of the forecast profits is then computed for each 
case. If the present value of forecast pre-tax profits with constant 
controls is less than 50 percent of the present value of forecast pre-
tax profits without controls (base case) the smelter passes the test and 
is eligible for an NSO. The smelter also passes the test if the present 
value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) is 
negative.
    (b) Rate of Return Test. The applicant must complete Schedules B.4, 
B.5, and C.1 through C.5 to determine eligibility under the Rate of 
Return Test. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, 
respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule C.1 
summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Rate of Return Test. Schedule 
C.2 reports forecast sustaining capital investment for the constant 
controls case. Schedule C.3 reports historical net investment for the 
most recent fiscal year expressed in constant dollars, i.e., dollars of 
the year in which the application is made.
    Schedule C.4 presents the calculations for the Rate of Return Test. 
The applicant reports in Schedule C.4 the forecast cash flows from 
Schedules C.1 and C.2 and the horizon value from Schedule C.5, computes 
their present value, and subtracts the value of invested capital in 
constant dollars (taken from Schedule C.3) to yield net present value. 
If the net present value is less than zero, the smelter passes the test 
and is eligible to receive an NSO. This result indicates that the 
smelter is expected to earn a rate of

[[Page 192]]

return less than the industry average cost of capital.
    2.9.2 Interim Control Waivers. An applicant for a waiver from 
interim controls must complete either a portion or all of Schedules D.1 
through D.7, depending on whether the application is for a temporary or 
permanent waiver.
    (a) Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls Test. The applicant must 
complete Schedules D.1 through D.3 to establish eligibility for a 
temporary waiver from interim controls. Schedules D.1 and D.2 report 
forecast revenue and cost data under the assumption of installation of 
interim constant control equipment and no installation of any additional 
SO<INF>2</INF> controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to 
install but for the issuance of the NSO. Schedule D.3 summarizes 
Schedules D.1 and D.2 and calculates gross operating profit. If gross 
operating profit is negative for any year during which the NSO is in 
effect, the applicant is eligible for a temporary waiver.
    (b) Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls Test. The applicant must 
complete Schedules D.1 through D.7. All schedules except for Schedule 
D.5 must be completed twice, based on two alternative assumptions: (1) 
installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of 
any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls that the smelter would otherwise 
be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO, and closure of 
the smelter after January 1, 1988; and (2) installation of interim 
constant control equipment, installation of any additional 
SO<INF>2</INF> controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP 
emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued operation of the 
smelter after January 1, 1988.
    Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under 
each assumption. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2, and 
Schedule D.4 reports forecast sustaining capital under each assumption. 
Schedule D.5 reports cash proceeds from liquidation.
    Schedule D.6 presents the calculations for the permanent waiver 
test. In Schedule D.6, the applicant reports cash flow projections from 
Schedules D.3 and D.4 and the horizon value from Schedule D.7, computes 
their present value and subtracts the current salvage value (taken from 
Schedule D.5) to yield net present value. The higher of the two net 
present value figures computed under the two alternative assumptions 
must be used in the test. If the higher net present value figure is 
negative, the applicant is eligible for a permanent waiver.
    2.10 Use of exhibits. In addition to data required by the schedules 
included in this application, the following information must be attached 
as exhibits.
    2.10.1 Exhibit A. Background information on the firm's 
organizational structure and its associated accounting and financial 
reporting systems for primary nonferrous activities. This information 
must include, where applicable, the firm's:
    (a) Operating association with an ownership control in consolidated 
subsidiaries, unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures and other 
affiliated companies.
    (b) Organizational subdivision of its primary nonferrous activities 
into profit centers, cost centers and/or related financial reporting 
entities employed to control the operation of its mines, concentrators, 
smelters, refineries and other associated facilities.
    (c) Material and product flows among the smelter subject to this NSO 
application, other integrated facilities and its affiliated suppliers

integrated facilities. For both integrated and nonintegrated facilities, 
applicants also must describe the proportion contributed to its primary 
nonferrous activities by material purchases from and product sales to 
affiliated suppliers and customers.
    (d) Annual operating capacity over the five most recent fiscal years 
for the smelter subject to this application. Operating capacity must be 
defined in terms of the total quantity of throughput that could have 
been processed with the available facilities after giving appropriate 
allowance to normal downtime requirements for maintenance and repairs. 
Operating capacity data also must consider both capacity balancing 
requirements among processing steps and annual processing yield rates 
attainable for each facility.
    (e) Weighted average analysis of concentrates processed and tonnage 
produced annually over each of the five most recent fiscal years by the 
smelter subject to this application.
    (f) Accounting system and policies for recording investment 
expenditures, operating revenues, operating costs and income taxes 
associated with its primary nonferrous activities. Applicants also must 
provide a complete description of allocation techniques employed for 
assigning investments, revenues, costs and taxes to individual profit, 
cost of departmental centers for which costs are accumulated. Applicants 
must further indicate the relationship of cost and/or departmental 
accounting entities to the firm's established profit centers.
    (g) Annual five-year operating and capital expenditure plans (or 
budgets) by individual nonferrous profit center. These documents must 
include previous plans prepared for the five preceding fiscal years as 
well as the current one-year and five-year operating and

[[Page 193]]

capital expenditure plans. At least the current one-year and five-year 
plans must provide a specific breakdown of investment expenditures and 
operating costs associated with the operation and maintenance of each 
profit center's existing and proposed pollution control facilities.
    2.10.2 Exhibit B. Supplemental description and explanation of items

    2.10.3 Exhibit C. Financial data documentation. Applicants must 
document annual balance sheet, income statement and supporting data 
reported for the firm's preceding five fiscal years or for that portion 
of the past five years during which the firm engaged in smelter 
operations. This documentation must be provided by attaching to the 
application:
    (a) SEC 10-K reports filed by the parent corporation for each of the 
preceding five fiscal years.
    (b) Certified financial statements prepared on a consolidated basis 
for the parent corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. This 
requirement may be omitted for those years in which SEC 10-K reports 
have been attached to this Exhibit.
    (c) Business Segment Information reports filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission by the firm for each of the preceding five years 
(as available).

                  Schedule A.1--Historical Revenue Data

    General. Use Schedule A.1 to report annual historical revenue data 
for fiscal years 1979 through 1983. Revenues include product sales and 
associated operating revenues, net of returns and allowances, from 
smelter sales and/or transfers of copper, lead, zinc and molybdenum or 
other nonferrous metal products and tolling services to both 
unaffiliated and affiliated customers. The line items in Schedule A.1 
are explained in the following instructions.

    Lines 01, 14, 27 and 40--Primary Nonferrous Product Sales. Report 
for each year the total quantity of copper, lead, zinc and molybdenum or 
other nonferrous metal product sales.
    Lines 02, 15, 28 and 41--Unaffiliated Customer Sales. Report for 
each year the respective quantities of copper, lead, zinc and molybdenum 
or other nonferrous metal product sales to unaffiliated customers.
    Lines 03, 16, 29 and 42--Unaffiliated Customer Revenues. Report for 
each year the total operating revenues derived from smelter sales of 
copper, lead, zinc and molybdenum or other nonferrous metals to 
unaffiliated customers.
    Lines 04, 17, 30 and 43--Unaffiliated Customer Prices. Report for 
each year the average unit price received on smelter sales of copper, 
lead, zinc and molybdenum or other nonferrous metals to unaffiliated 
customers. The prices are computed as operating revenues reported on 
Lines 03, 16, 29 and 42 divided by the quantities reported on Lines 02, 
15, 28 and 41, respectively.
    Lines 05, 18, 31 and 44--Average Product Quality Grade. Report for 
each year the average quality rating assigned to copper, lead, zinc and 
molybdenum or other nonferrous metal products purchased by the smelter's 
unaffiliated customers.
    Lines 06, 19, 32 and 45--Affiliated Customers Sales. Report for each 
year the respective quantities of copper, lead, zinc and molybdenum or

total of Lines 01 through 06. Transfer the reported total for each year 
to Schedule C.4, Line 06.

     Schedule C.3--Historical Capital Investment In Constant Dollars

    General. Use Schedule C.3 to report the end-of-period asset 
investments and current liabilities for the most recent fiscal year: (a) 
expressed in nominal dollars as of the date of the original transaction, 
and (b) expressed in the current year's dollars, i.e. 1984 dollars. The 
value of net investment in constant dollars (1984 dollars for smelters 
applying for an NSO in 1984) is used in Schedule C.4 as the benchmark of 
the Rate of Return Test.
    Applicants should complete Schedule C.3 according to the following 
instructions. Transfer into the first column of Schedule C.3 the 
historical cost figures that are reported in the last (1983) column of 
Table A.4. In the second column of Schedule C.3, report the figures from 
the first column of Schedule C.3, expressed in constant (1984) dollars.
    Convert each nominal dollar figure of the first column into constant 
(1984) dollars in accordance with the historical cost/constant dollar 
accounting method defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 
Statement No. 33 (Docket Item No. IV-A-6d), with the following 
exception: the applicant must not report the lower recoverable amount as 
required by FASB No. 33. Attach explanatory supporting schedules as part 
of Exhibit B.

                    Schedule C.4--Rate of Return Test

    General. Applicants must complete this Schedule and/or Schedule B.7 
and the accompanying schedules if they seek eligibility for an NSO. The 
line items in Schedule C.4 are explained in the following instructions.
    Line 01--Net Income from Operations. Enter for each year the amounts 
reported in Schedule C.1, Line 24.

[[Page 208]]

    Line 04--Operating Cash Flow. Enter for each year the total of 
amounts reported on Lines 01 through 03.
    Line 05--Constant Controls Capital Investment. Enter the estimated 
capital outlays for constant controls for the years during which outlays 
would be made. These values shall correspond to the constant control 
investment estimates shown in the supporting schedules for Line 17 of 
Schedule C.1. Changes in working capital investment due to investment in 
constant controls facilities may be added to the capital investment 
estimates shown in the supporting schedules for Schedule C.1.

zero. If the value is zero or less, enter zero.
    Line 17--Net Present Value. Enter the difference between Lines 15 
and 16. Applicants reporting a negative net present value will pass the 
Rate of Return Test.

  Schedule C.5--Horizon Value of Cash Flows for the Rate of Return Test

    General. The applicant should use Schedule C.5 to calculate the 
horizon value of net cash flow projections for the Rate of Return Test. 
This horizon value is used in Schedule C.4. The computation of the 
horizon value is different for this test than for the Profit Protection 
Test because this test requires the reporting of depreciation for tax 
purposes.
    In Schedule C.5, the applicant removes the tax savings of constant 
controls depreciation from the cash flows for the last two forecast 
years. A depreciation-free horizon value is then calculated from these 
depreciation-free cash flows. The tax savings of constant controls 
depreciation during the horizon years are then calculated separately. 
The final horizon value is equal to the sum of the depreciation-free 
horizon value and the tax savings from depreciation of constant controls 
accruing over the horizon years. The line items in Schedule C.5 are 
explained in the following instructions.
    Line 01--Net Cash Flow Projections. Enter for each of the final two 
forecast years the values in Schedule C.4, Line 08, for the 
corresponding years.
    Line 02--Depreciation and Amortization. Enter for each of the final 
two forecast years the value in Schedule C.4, Line 02, for the 
corresponding years.
    Line 03--Marginal Tax Rate. Enter for each of the final two forecast 
years the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate 
should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.
    Line 04--Tax Savings. Enter for each of the final two forecast years 
the product of Lines 02 and 03.
    Line 05--Nominal Dollar Values. Enter for each of the final two 
forecast years the difference between Lines 01 and 04.
    Line 06--1990 Dollar Values. For each of the final two forecast 
years the nominal dollar values must be expressed in the last forecast 
year's dollars (1990 dollars). Transfer the 1990 amount in Line 05 
directly to Line 06. Inflate the 1989 amount to 1990 dollars using the 
forecast GNP price deflator.
    Line 07--Average. Enter under the Total column the average of the 
two values in Line 06.
    Line 08--Horizon Factor. Enter under the Total column the horizon 
factor provided in Section 2.7.
    Line 09--Depreciation-free Horizon Value. Enter under the Total 
column the product of Lines 07 and 08.
    Line 10--Depreciation and Amortization. Enter for each year of the 
horizon period depreciation charges associated with the smelter's 
investment in equipment and facilities related to pollution controls. 
These investments should include those actually made and those required 
to be made by the end of the forecast period. Reported charges should be 
computed in accordance with depreciation and amortization methods 
adopted for tax reporting purposes by the firm. Attach as part of 
Exhibit B supporting schedules consistent with those supporting Line 17 
in Schedule C.1.

[[Page 209]]

    Line 11--Marginal Tax Rate. Enter for each year of the horizon 
period the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate 
should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.
    Line 12--Tax Savings. Enter for each year of the horizon period the 
product of Lines 10 and 11.
    Line 13--Discount Factors. Enter the discount factor for each year 
of the horizon period. This shall be computed according to the 
instructions under Section 2.6, except that the variable N found in the 
discount factor formula represents the number of years in the future, 
counting from the last forecast year. For example, N=1 for the first 
year of the horizon period.
    Line 14--Present Value of Tax Savings. Enter for each year of the 
horizon period the product of Lines 12 and 13.
    Line 15--Total Present Value of Tax Savings. Enter under the Total 
column the sum of values on Line 14 for the horizon years.
    Line 16--Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the sum of 
Lines 09 and 15.

             Schedule D.1--Interim Controls Revenue Forecast

    General. Use Schedule D.1 to report annual forecasts of operating 
revenues anticipated during the years 1984 through 1990 from operation 
of the smelter applying for an interim controls waiver. The applicant 
applying for a permanent waiver should complete Schedule D.1 twice, with 
revenue and production projections based on two alternative assumptions: 
(1) Installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation 
of any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls that the smelter would 
otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and 
closure after January 1, 1988, and (2) installation of interim constant 
control equipment and any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls required to 
comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, so 
that the smelter will remain open through the horizon period. The 
applicant applying for a temporary waiver should use only the first 
assumption. For a smelter that has no continuous emission controls, the 
assumed interim control investment program should be based on the 
installation and operation of a well-designed sulfuric acid plant to 
treat all strong gas streams. For a smelter that already has some 
continuous emission controls, the assumed interim constant control 
investment should be based on the installation and operation of any 
additional acid plant capacity that would be necessary for treatment of 
all strong streams with interim constant controls. The interim controls 
projections should account for other regulatory requirements on the same 
basis as provided for in the NSO eligibility tests.
    Forecast smelter revenues should be expressed on a tolling service 
equivalent basis as described in Section 2.3.4. The line items in 
Schedule D.1 are explained in the following instructions. Attach as part 
of Exhibit B schedules to (1) explain the methods used to make the 
required forecasts, (2) explain differences, if any, between historical 
trends and the forecasts, and (3) provide data and information to 
support the forecasts.
    Lines 01 and 05--Concentrates Processed. Report for each year the 
forecast quantity of concentrates processed for unaffiliated parties

derived from the co-product sales.
    Line 10--Total By-product Revenues From Pollution Control 
Facilities. Report for each year forecast revenues from the sale of by-
products derived from operation of the smelter's pollution control 
facilities. Attach as part of Exhibit B a schedule showing by type of 
by-product produced (e.g., sulfuric acid) the forecast quantity of 
output, forecast market price per unit of output sold, and forecast 
total revenue derived from the by-product sales.
    Line 11--Total By-product Revenues From Other Smelter Processing. 
Report forecast revenues from the sales of gold, silver, and other by-
products derived from the smelter's operations. Attach as part of 
Exhibit B a schedule providing additional documentation as specified in 
the instructions for Line 10.
    Line 12--Total Co-product and By-product Revenues. Enter for each 
year the total of Lines 09 through 11.

              Schedule D.2--Interim Controls Cost Forecast

    General. Use Schedule D.2 to report annual forecasts of operating 
costs anticipated during the years 1984 through 1990 from operation of 
the smelter applying for an interim controls waiver. The applicant 
applying for a

[[Page 210]]

permanent waiver should complete Schedule D.2 twice, with cost and 
production projections based on two alternative assumptions: (1) 
Installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of 
any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls that the smelter would otherwise 
be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure after 
January 1, 1988, and (2) installation of interim constant control 
equipment and any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls required to comply 
with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, so that 
the smelter will remain open through the horizon period. For a smelter 
that has no continuous emission controls, the assumed interim control 
investment program should be based on the installation and operation of 
a well-designed sulfuric acid plant to treat all strong gas streams. For 
a smelter that already has some continuous emission controls, the 
assumed interim constant control investment should be based on the 
installation and operation of any additional acid plant capacity that 
would be necessary for treatment of all strong streams with interim 
constant controls. The interim controls projections should account for 
other regulatory requirements on the same basis as provided for in the 
NSO eligibility tests.
    The line items in Schedule D.2 are explained in the following 
instructions. Attach as part of Exhibit B schedules to (1) explain the 
methods used to make the required forecasts, (2) explain differences, if 
any, between historical trends and the forecasts, and (3) provide data

Schedule D.3 that was completed under the assumption of installation of 
interim constant control equipment and no installation of any additional 
SO<INF>2</INF> controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to 
install but for the issuance of an NSO. Applicants will be eligible for 
a temporary waiver from the interim development of constant control 
technology for sulfur dioxide emissions if the reported gross operating 
profit on Line 13 is a negative value for one or more years during which 
the NSO is in effect.

  Schedule D.4--Interim Controls Sustaining Capital Investment Forecast

    General. Use Schedule D.4 to report yearly sustaining capital 
outlays for maintenance of the smelter's existing productive capability. 
The applicant should complete Schedule D.4 twice, under two alternative 
assumptions: (1) Installation of interim constant control equipment, no 
installation of any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls that the smelter 
would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, 
and closure after January 1, 1988, and (2) installation of interim 
constant equipment and any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls required 
to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, 
so that the smelter will remain open through the horizon period.
    Major elements of these outlays should be disclosed, as well as the 
total of such outlays. Estimates shall be restricted to those items that 
will be capitalized for tax purposes. These outlays shall primarily be 
for plant replacement, although outlays for improvements and expansion 
may be included to the extent that improvements and/or expansion, 
exclusive of required pollution control outlays, can be justified as 
economically feasible. Estimates of sustaining capital investments shall 
exclude any incremental investment for sulfur dioxide emission controls 
reported in Line 06 of Schedule D.6. Sustaining capital investments in 
facilities shared with other operating segments shall be allocated in 
accordance with the instructions given below.
    Estimates of sustaining capital shall be compatible with productive 
capacity and pollution control requirements underlying the operating 
revenue and cost forecasts incorporated in Schedule D.3.
    Line 01 to 06--Sustaining Capital. Report for each year by 
individual line item property, plant and equipment sustaining capital 
investments assignable to smelter operations. Include both (1) property, 
plant and equipment directly associated with the smelter's operations 
and (2) facilities shared with other operating segments to the extent 
that a causal and beneficial relationship can be established for the 
intersegment allocations of such facility investments.
    Attach as part of Exhibit B an explanatory schedule disclosing and 
supporting by individual line item the major elements of annual capital 
expenditures for sustaining capital. Further classify these annual 
capital expenditures into both (1) investments required to maintain the 
smelter versus investments in smelter expansion and improvements and (2) 
direct facility versus joint-use facility investments. Explain the 
method used for allocating capital expenditures on joint-use facilities 
to the smelter's operations.

[[Page 213]]

    Line 07--Total Smelter Sustaining Capital. Enter for each year the 
total of Lines 01 through 06. Transfer the reported total for each year 
to Schedule D.6, Line 06.

              Schedule D.5--Cash Proceeds From Liquidation

    General. Use Schedule D.5 to calculate cash proceeds from 
liquidation. Applicants should determine the current salvage value of 
their existing investment in the smelter as the net proceeds that could 
be derived through an orderly liquidation of the smelter's assets. The 
net cash proceeds should be reported after an appropriate allowance for 
disposal costs, contractual claims against the smelter (e.g., labor 
termination penalties), and income tax effects on the corporation of 
such liquidation costs.
    The applicant must stipulate the most advantageous alternative 
market (use) for the smelter's facilities. Generally, this market will 
be:

    Secondary market for used plant and equipment.
    Sale for scrap.
    Abandonment where the disposal cost exceeds scrap value.

    The current net salvage value should be disaggregated into the same 
property, plant and equipment asset groups reported under the historical 
capital investment summary, Schedule A.4. The line items in Schedule D.5 
are explained in the following instructions.
    Line 01--Current Assets. Enter in Columns 1 and 2, the value of 
total current assets shown in Line 08 of Schedule A.4 (Historical 
Capital Investment Summary) for 1983. No gain or loss should be reported 
in Columns 3 through 5 for the liquidation of current asset investments.
    Lines 02-07--Property Plant and Equipment. Enter in Column 1 the 
appraised liquidation value (in terms of pretax cash proceeds) of the 
smelter by asset group. This estimate should be certified by a qualified 
third party professional appraiser and shall represent the best use and 
highest alternative value of these assets. The liquidation value of any 
assets which are jointly used by the smelter and other operating 
segments shall be excluded if, upon closure of the smelter, such assets 
would continue in service for the non-smelter activity.
    In Column 2, report the net book value of these assets for which 
liquidation values have been reported in Column 1. The reported values 
should correspond with amounts reported for 1982 in lines 09 through 15 
in Schedule A.4 as adjusted for appropriate eliminations of joint-use 
facilities and reconciliation to a net book value as reported for income 
taxes. Attach as part of Exhibit B supporting schedules showing all 
adjustments and conversion of the net book value as reported on the 
financial statements, to net book value that would be used for income 
tax purposes.
    Compute Column 3 as Column 1 less Column 2. The gain (or loss) shown 
in Column 3 shall be segregated into ordinary income and capital gains 
components subject to taxation pursuant to applicable income tax rules. 
Enter ordinary income in Column 4 and capital gains in Column 5.
    Line 08--Total Smelter Investment. Enter the sum of Lines 02 through 
07 for each of the columns.
    Line 09--Other Non-current Assets. In Column 1, report the appraised 
value of other non-current assets in accordance with the instructions 
for Line 18, Schedule A.4, except that any joint asset(s) that would 
continue in the event of smelter liquidation shall be excluded. This 
estimate shall be certified by a qualified third-party professional 
appraiser.
    In Column 2, report the net book value of the non-current assets 
directly corresponding to those assets included in the liquidation value 
estimated under Column 1.
    The remaining columns shall be completed in accordance with the 
instructions given above for Lines 02 and 06.
    Line 10--Total Smelter Value. Enter the sum of Lines 01, 08 and 09.
    Line 11--Total Current Liabilities. Report in both Columns 1 and 2, 
the value of total current liabilities shown in Line 25 of Schedule A.4 
for 1983.
    Line 12--Gross Liquidation Value. Enter the difference between Lines 
10 and 11.
    Line 13--Liquidation Costs. In Columns 1, 3 and 4, report the value 
of any liquidation costs such as labor contract termination penalties, 
severance pay and related costs, associated with closure of the smelter.
    Line 14--Taxable Gain (or Loss). Enter in Columns 4 and 5, the 
differences between Lines 12 and 13.
    Line 15--Income Tax Rate. Enter the sum of the Federal, State and 
local marginal tax rates of the firm for ordinary income and capital 
gains in Columns 4 and 5, respectively. Attach as part of Exhibit B a 
schedule detailing the estimated marginal tax rate by taxing entity.
    Line 16--Income Tax on Gain (or Loss). In Columns 4 and 5, enter the 
product of Line 14 and the marginal income tax rates reported in Line 
15. In Column 1, enter the sum of Columns 4 and 5.
    Line 17--After Tax Cash Proceeds. Enter in Column 1 the difference 
between Line 12 and the sum of Lines 13 and 16.

        Schedule D.6--Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls Test

    General. Applicants must complete this Schedule and its supporting 
schedules if they seek a permanent waiver from interim control 
requirements. The applicant should complete Schedule D.6 twice, with 
revenue

[[Page 214]]

and production projections based on two alternative assumptions: (1) 
Installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of 
any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls that the smelter would otherwise 
be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure after 
January 1, 1988, and (2) installation of interim constant control 
equipment and any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls required to comply 
with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, so that 
the smelter will remain open through the horizon period. Forecasts in 
Schedule D.6 shall be compatible with assumptions and forecasts in each 
set of Schedules D.1 through D.4. The line items in Schedule D.6 are 
explained in the following instructions.
    Line 01--Net Income from Operations. Enter for each year the amounts 
reported in Schedule D.3, Line 24.
    Line 02--Net Income Adjustments. Enter any adjustments to net income 
not included in Schedule D.3. When assuming closure after January 1, 
1988, the applicant must include the proceeds from liquidation in 1988. 
The applicant must estimate liquidation value as of 1988 using one of 
two methods: (1) the applicant may complete Schedule D.5 assuming 
liquidation in 1988 and report the value of after-tax cash proceeds in 
Line 17; or (2) the applicant may use the value of after-tax cash 
proceeds in Line 17 of Schedule D.5, as already completed, assuming 
liquidation in the current (application) year, and expressing values in 
1988 dollars. The current liquidation value must be inflated to 1988 
dollars by applying the appropriate forecast percentage rate changes in 
the GNP price deflator. Attach explanatory supporting schedules in 
Exhibit B.
    Lines 03 and 04--Depreciation and Amortization. Enter for each year 
the amounts reported in Schedule D.3, Lines 17 and 18, respectively.
    Line 05--Operating Cash Flow. Enter for each year the total of 
amounts reported on Lines 01 through 04.
    Line 06--Pollution Controls Capital Investment. Enter the estimated 
pollution control capital outlays projected to be made under the two 
alternative sets of assumptions described in the General section of this 
schedule. These controls shall include only interim control equipment 
for the first set of assumptions and both interim control equipment and 
any additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls required to comply with the 
smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, for the second set 
of assumptions. The values assumed in this schedule shall correspond to 
the investment estimates shown in each set of supporting schedules for 
Line 17 of Schedule D.3. For purposes of allocating costs of the 
additional SO<INF>2</INF> controls under the second set of assumptions, 
applicants must provide information establishing the period over which 
capital outlays for such controls would be made if installation of the 
controls begins the latest date that would still allow compliance to be 
achieved by January 2, 1988. Changes in working capital investment due 
to investment in control facilities may be added to the capital 
investment estimates shown in the corresponding supporting schedules for 
Schedule D.3.
    Line 07--Sustaining Capital. Enter for each year the amounts 
reported in Schedule D.4, Line 07.
    Line 08--Total. Enter for each year the sum of Lines 05 and 06.
    Line 09--Net Cash Flow Projections. Enter for each year the 
difference between Lines 04 and 07.
    Line 10--Discount Factors. Enter the discount factor for each year, 
computed as described in the instructions under Section 2.6.
    Line 11--Present Value of Future Cash Flows. Enter for each year the 
product of Lines 08 and 09.
    Line 12--Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the estimated 
horizon value of the smelter reported in Schedule D.7, Line 16.
    Line 13--Discount Factor. Enter under the Total column the 
appropriate discount factor, computed as described in the instructions 
under Section 2.6.
    Line 14--Present Value of Horizon Value. Enter under the Total 
column the product of Lines 11 and 12.
    Line 15--Present Value of Future Cash Flows. Enter under the Total 
column the sum of amounts previously reported on Line 10 for 1984 
through 1990.
    Line 16--Total Present Value. Enter the sum of Lines 13 and 14.
    Line 17--Current Salvage Value. Enter the amount reported in 
Schedule D.5, Line 17, if the value is greater than zero. If the value 
is zero or less, enter zero.
    Line 18--Net Present Value. Enter the difference between Lines 16 
and 17. In determining eligibility for a permanent waiver from interim 
control requirements, an applicant must use the higher of the two net 
present value figures computed under the two alternative assumptions. 
Applicants reporting a negative value for the higher net present value 
figure will be eligible for a permanent waiver from interim use of a 
constant control system for sulfur dioxide emissions.

 Schedule D.7--Horizon Value of Cash Flows for the Interim Controls Test

    General. Use Schedule D.7 to calculate the horizon value of net cash 
flow projections for the Interim Controls Test. This horizon value is 
used in Schedule D.6. The computation of the horizon value is different 
for this test than for the Profit Protection Test because this test 
requires the reporting of depreciation for tax purposes.

[[Page 215]]

    In Schedule D.7, the applicant removes the tax savings of control 
equipment depreciation from the cash flows for the last two forecast 
years. A depreciation-free horizon value is then calculated from these 
depreciation-free cash flows. The tax savings of constant controls 
depreciation during the horizon years are then calculated separately. 
The final horizon value is equal to the sum of the depreciation-free 
horizon value and the tax savings from depreciation of constant controls 
accruing over the horizon years. The line items in Schedule D.7 are 
explained in the following instruction.
    Line 01--Net Cash Flow Projections. Enter for each of the final two 
forecast years the values in Schedule D.6, Line 09, for the 
corresponding years.
    Line 02--Depreciation and Amortization. Enter for each of the final 
two forecast years the value in Schedule D.6, Line 03, for the 
corresponding years.
    Line 03--Marginal Tax Rate. Enter for each of the final two forecast 
years the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate 
should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.
    Line 04--Tax Savings. Enter for each of the final two forecast years 
the product of Lines 02 and 03.
    Line 05--Nominal Dollar Values. Enter for each of the final two 
forecast years the difference between Lines 01 and 04.
    Line 06--1990 Dollar Values. For each of the final two forecast 
years the nominal dollar values must be expressed in the last forecast 
year's dollars (1990 dollars). Transfer the 1990 amount in Line 05 
directly to Line 06. Inflate the 1989 amount to 1990 dollars using the 
forecast GNP price deflator.
    Line 07--Average. Enter under the Total column the average of the 
two values in Line 06.
    Line 08--Horizon Factor. Enter under the Total column the horizon 
factor provided in Section 2.7.
    Line 09--Depreciation-free Horizon Value. Enter under the Total 
column the product of Lines 07 and 08.
    Line 10--Depreciation and Amortization. Enter for each year of the 
horizon period depreciation charges associated with the smelter's 
investment in equipment and facilities related to pollution controls. 
These investments should include those actually made and those forecast 
to be made by the end of the forecast period. Reported charges should be 
computed in accordance with depreciation and amortization methods 
adopted for tax reporting purposes by the firm. Attach as part of 
exhibit B supporting schedules consistent with those supporting Line 17 
in Schedule D.3.
    Line 11--Marginal Tax Rate. Enter for each year of the horizon 
period the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate 
should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.
    Line 12--Tax Savings. Enter for each year of the horizon period the 
product of Lines 10 and 11.
    Line 13--Discount Factors. Enter the discount factor for each year 
of the horizon period. This shall be computed according to the 
instructions under Section 2.6, except that the variable N found in the 
discount factor formula represents the number of years in the future, 
counting from the last forecast year. For example, N=1 for the first 
year of the horizon period.
    Line 14--Present Value of Tax Savings. Enter for each year of the 
horizon period the product of Lines 12 and 13.
    Line 15--Total Present Value of Tax Savings. Enter under the Total 
column the sum of values on Line 14 for the horizon years.
    Line 16--Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the sum of 
Lines 09 and 15.

given them in the Act.
    Act means the Clean Air Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq.)
    Additive and multiplicative bias means the linear regression 
intercept and slope of a linear plot fitted to corresponding candidate 
and reference method mean measurement data pairs.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) or his or her authorized representative.
    Air Quality System (AQS) means EPA's computerized system for storing 
and reporting of information relating to ambient air quality data.
    Approved regional method (ARM) means a continuous PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
method that has been approved specifically within a State or local air 
monitoring network for purposes of comparison to the NAAQS and to meet 
other monitoring objectives.
    AQCR means air quality control region.
    CO means carbon monoxide.
    Combined statistical area (CSA) is defined by the U.S. Office of 
Management and Budget as a geographical area consisting of two or more 
adjacent Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) with employment interchange 
of at least 15 percent. Combination is automatic if the employment 
interchange is 25 percent and determined by local opinion if more than 
15 but less than 25 percent (http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/
metro-city/List6.txt).
    Community monitoring zone (CMZ) means an optional averaging area 
with established, well defined boundaries, such as county or census 
block, within an MPA that has relatively uniform concentrations of 
annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> as defined by appendix N of part 50 of this 
chapter. Two or more community-oriented SLAMS monitors within a CMZ that 
meet certain requirements as set forth in appendix N of part 50 of this 
chapter may be averaged for making comparisons to the annual 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.
    Core-based statistical area (CBSA) is defined by the U.S. Office of 
Management and Budget, as a statistical geographic entity consisting of 
the county or counties associated with at least one urbanized area/urban 
cluster of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a 
high degree of social and economic integration. Metropolitan Statistical 
Areas (MSAs) and micropolitan statistical areas are the two categories 
of CBSA (metropolitan areas have populations greater than 50,000; and 
micropolitan areas have populations between 10,000 and 50,000). In the 
case of very large cities where two or more CBSAs are combined, these 
larger areas are referred to as combined statistical areas (CSAs) 
(http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/List1.txt).
    Corrected concentration pertains to the result of an accuracy or 
precision assessment test of an open path analyzer in which a high-
concentration

[[Page 229]]

test or audit standard gas contained in a short test cell is inserted 
into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. When the pollutant 
concentration measured by the analyzer in such a test includes both the 
pollutant concentration in the test cell and the concentration in the 
atmosphere, the atmospheric pollutant concentration must be subtracted 
from the test measurement to obtain the corrected concentration test 
result. The corrected concentration is equal to the measured 
concentration minus the average of the atmospheric pollutant 
concentrations measured (without the test cell) immediately before and 
immediately after the test.
    Design value means the calculated concentration according to the 
applicable appendix of part 50 of this chapter for the highest site in 
an attainment or nonattainment area.
    EDO means environmental data operations.
    Effective concentration pertains to testing an open path analyzer 
with a high-concentration calibration or audit standard gas contained in 
a short test cell inserted into the optical measurement beam of the 
instrument. Effective concentration is the equivalent ambient-level 
concentration that would produce the same spectral absorbance over the 
actual atmospheric monitoring path length as produced by the high-
concentration gas in the short test cell. Quantitatively, effective 
concentration is equal to the actual concentration of the gas standard 
in the test cell multiplied by the ratio of the path length of the test 
cell to the actual atmospheric monitoring path length.
    Federal equivalent method (FEM) means a method for measuring the 
concentration of an air pollutant in the ambient air that has been 
designated as an equivalent method in accordance with part 53 of this 
chapter; it does not include a method for which an equivalent method 
designation has been canceled in accordance with Sec. 53.11 or Sec. 
53.16 of this chapter.
    Federal reference method (FRM) means a method of sampling and 
analyzing the ambient air for an air pollutant that is specified as a 
reference method in an appendix to part 50 of this chapter, or a method 
that has been designated as a reference method in accordance with this 
part; it does not include a method for which a reference method 
designation has been canceled in accordance with Sec. 53.11 or Sec. 
53.16 of this chapter.
    HNO3 means nitric acid.
    Local agency means any local government agency, other than the State 
agency, which is charged by a State with the responsibility for carrying 
out a portion of the plan.
    Meteorological measurements means measurements of wind speed, wind 
direction, barometric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, solar 
radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and/or precipitation.
    Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) means a CBSA associated with at 
least one urbanized area of 50,000 population or greater. The central 
county plus adjacent counties with a high degree of integration comprise 
the area.

measures or assists in the measurement of atmospheric air pollutants and 
which is acceptable for use in ambient air surveillance under the 
applicable provisions of appendix C to this part.
    Monitoring agency means a State or local agency responsible for 
meeting the requirements of this part.
    Monitoring organization means a State, local, or other monitoring 
organization responsible for operating a monitoring site for which the 
quality assurance regulations apply.
    Monitoring path for an open path analyzer means the actual path in 
space between two geographical locations over which the pollutant 
concentration is measured and averaged.
    Monitoring path length of an open path analyzer means the length of 
the monitoring path in the atmosphere over which the average pollutant 
concentration measurement (path-averaged concentration) is determined. 
See also, optical measurement path length.
    Monitoring planning area (MPA) means a contiguous geographic area 
with established, well defined boundaries, such as a CBSA, county or 
State, having a common area that is used for planning monitoring 
locations for

[[Page 230]]

PM<INF>2.5.</INF> An MPA may cross State boundaries, such as the 
Philadelphia PA-NJ MSA, and be further subdivided into community 
monitoring zones. MPAs are generally oriented toward CBSAs or CSAs with 
populations greater than 200,000, but for convenience, those portions of 
a State that are not associated with CBSAs can be considered as a single 
MPA.
    NATTS means the national air toxics trends stations. This network 
provides hazardous air pollution ambient data.
    NCore means the National Core multipollutant monitoring stations. 
Monitors at these sites are required to measure particles

measures the average atmospheric pollutant concentration in situ along 
one or more monitoring paths having a monitoring path length of 5 meters 
or more and that has been designated as a reference or equivalent method 
under the provisions of part 53 of this chapter.
    Optical measurement path length means the actual length of the 
optical beam over which measurement of the pollutant is determined. The 
path-integrated pollutant concentration measured by the analyzer is 
divided by the optical measurement path length to determine the path-
averaged concentration. Generally, the optical measurement path length 
is:
    (1) Equal to the monitoring path length for a (bistatic) system 
having a transmitter and a receiver at opposite ends of the monitoring 
path;
    (2) Equal to twice the monitoring path length for a (monostatic) 
system having a transmitter and receiver at one end of the monitoring 
path and a mirror or retroreflector at the other end; or
    (3) Equal to some multiple of the monitoring path length for more 
complex systems having multiple passes of the measurement beam through 
the monitoring path.

<R05>
Sec. 58.10  Annual monitoring network plan and periodic network assessment.

    (a)(1) Beginning July 1, 2007, the State, or where applicable local, 
agency shall adopt and submit to the Regional Administrator an annual 
monitoring network plan which shall provide for the establishment and 
maintenance of an air quality surveillance system that consists of a 
network of SLAMS monitoring stations including FRM, FEM, and ARM 
monitors that are part of SLAMS, NCore stations, STN stations, State 
speciation stations, SPM stations, and/or, in serious, severe and 
extreme ozone nonattainment areas, PAMS stations, and SPM monitoring 
stations. The plan shall include a statement of purposes for each 
monitor and evidence that siting and operation of each monitor meets the 
requirements of appendices A, C, D, and E of this part, where 
applicable. The annual monitoring network plan must be made available 
for public inspection for at least 30 days prior to submission to EPA.
    (2) Any annual monitoring network plan that proposes SLAMS network 
modifications including new monitoring sites is subject to the approval 
of the EPA Regional Administrator, who shall provide opportunity for 
public comment and shall approve or disapprove the plan and schedule 
within 120 days. If the State or local agency has already provided a 
public comment opportunity on its plan and has made no changes 
subsequent to that comment opportunity, the Regional Administrator is 
not required to provide a separate opportunity for comment.
    (3) The plan for establishing required NCore multipollutant stations 
shall be submitted to the Administrator not later than July 1, 2009. The 
plan shall provide for all required stations to be operational by 
January 1, 2011.
    (b) The annual monitoring network plan must contain the following 
information for each existing and proposed site:
    (1) The AQS site identification number.
    (2) The location, including street address and geographical 
coordinates.
    (3) The sampling and analysis method(s) for each measured parameter.
    (4) The operating schedules for each monitor.
    (5) Any proposals to remove or move a monitoring station within a 
period of 18 months following plan submittal.
    (6) The monitoring objective and spatial scale of representativeness 
for

[[Page 233]]

each monitor as defined in appendix D to this part.
    (7) The identification of any sites that are suitable and sites that 
are not suitable for comparison against the annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
NAAQS as described in Sec. 58.30.
    (8) The MSA, CBSA, CSA or other area represented by the monitor.
    (c) The annual monitoring network plan must document how States and 
local agencies provide for the review of changes to a PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitoring network that impact the location of a violating 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitor or the creation/change to a community 
monitoring zone, including a description of the proposed use of spatial 
averaging for purposes of making comparisons to the annual 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS as set forth in appendix N to part 50 of this 
chapter. The affected State or local agency must document the process 
for obtaining public comment and include any comments received through 
the public notification process within their submitted plan.
    (d) The State, or where applicable local, agency shall perform and 
submit to the EPA Regional Administrator an assessment of the air 
quality surveillance system every 5 years to determine, at a minimum, if 
the network meets the monitoring objectives defined in appendix D to 
this part, whether new sites are needed, whether existing sites are no 
longer needed and can be terminated, and whether new technologies are 
appropriate for incorporation into the ambient air monitoring network. 
The network assessment must consider the ability of existing and 
proposed sites to support air quality characterization for areas with 
relatively high populations of susceptible individuals (e.g., children 
with asthma), and, for any sites that are being proposed for 
discontinuance, the effect on data users other than the agency itself, 
such as nearby States and Tribes or health effects studies. For 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>, the assessment also must identify needed changes to 
population-oriented sites. The State, or where applicable local, agency 
must submit a copy of this 5-year assessment, along with a revised 
annual network plan, to the Regional Administrator. The first assessment 
is due July 1, 2010.
    (e) All proposed additions and discontinuations of SLAMS monitors in 
annual monitoring network plans and periodic network assessments are 
subject to approval according to Sec. 58.14.

    Effective Date Note: At 72 FR 32210, June 12, 2007, Sec. 58.10 was 
amended by revising the second sentence in paragraph (a)(2), effective 
Sept. 10, 2007. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set 
forth as follows:

    (2) * * * If the State or local agency has already provided a public 
comment opportunity on its plan and has made no changes subsequent to 
that comment opportunity, and has submitted the received comments 
together with the plan, the Regional Administrator is not required to 
provide a separate opportunity for comment.

Sec. 58.11  Network technical requirements.

    (a)(1) State and local governments shall follow the applicable 
quality assurance criteria contained in appendix A to this part when 
operating the SLAMS networks.
    (2) Beginning January 1, 2009, State and local governments shall 
follow the quality assurance criteria contained in appendix A to this 
part that apply to SPM sites when operating any SPM site which uses a 
FRM, FEM, or ARM and meets the requirements of appendix E to this part, 
unless the Regional Administrator approves an alternative to the 
requirements of appendix A with respect to such SPM sites because 
meeting those requirements would be physically and/or financially 
impractical due to physical conditions at the monitoring site and the 
requirements are not essential to achieving the intended data objectives 
of the SPM site. Alternatives to the requirements of appendix A may be 
approved for an SPM site as part of the approval of the annual 
monitoring plan, or separately.
    (3) The owner or operator of an existing or a proposed source shall 
follow the quality assurance criteria in appendix A to this part that 
apply to PSD monitoring when operating a PSD site.
    (b) State and local governments must follow the criteria in appendix 
C to this

[[Page 234]]

part to determine acceptable monitoring methods or instruments for use 
in SLAMS networks. Appendix C criteria are optional at SPM stations.
    (c) State and local governments must follow the network design 
criteria contained in appendix D to this part in designing and 
maintaining the SLAMS stations. The final network design and all changes 
in design are subject to approval of the Regional Administrator. NCore, 
STN, and PAMS network design and changes are also subject to approval of 
the Administrator. Changes in SPM stations do not require approvals, but 
a change in the designation of a monitoring site from SLAMS to SPM 
requires approval of the Regional Administrator.
    (d) State and local governments must follow the criteria contained 
in appendix E to this part for siting monitor inlets, paths or probes at 
SLAMS stations. Appendix E adherence is optional for SPM stations.


<R05>
Sec. 58.12  Operating schedules.

    State and local governments shall collect ambient air quality data 
at any SLAMS station on the following operational schedules:
    (a) For continuous analyzers, consecutive hourly averages must be 
collected except during:
    (1) Periods of routine maintenance,
    (2) Periods of instrument calibration, or
    (3) Periods or monitoring seasons exempted by the Regional 
Administrator.
    (b) For Pb manual methods, at least one 24-hour sample must be 
collected every 6 days except during periods or seasons exempted by the 
Regional Administrator.
    (c) For PAMS VOC samplers, samples must be collected as specified in 
section 5 of appendix D to this part. Area-specific PAMS operating 
schedules must be included as part of the PAMS network description and 
must be approved by the Regional Administrator.
    (d) For manual PM<INF>2.5</INF> samplers:
    (1) Manual PM<INF>2.5</INF> samplers at SLAMS stations other than 
NCore stations must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day schedule at sites 
without a collocated continuously operating PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitor. 
For SLAMS PM<INF>2.5</INF> sites with both manual and continuous 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitors operating, the monitoring agency may request 
approval for a reduction to 1-in-6 day PM<INF>2.5</INF> sampling at 
SLAMS stations or for seasonal sampling from the EPA Regional 
Administrator. The EPA Regional Administrator may grant sampling 
frequency reductions after consideration of factors, including but not 
limited to the historical PM<INF>2.5</INF> data quality assessments, the 
location of current PM<INF>2.5</INF> design value sites, and their 
regulatory data needs. Sites that have design values that are within 
plus or minus 10 percent of the NAAQS; and sites where the 24-hour 
values exceed the NAAQS for a period of 3 years are required to maintain 
at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency. Sites that have a design value 
within plus or minus 5 percent of the daily PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS must 
have an FRM or FEM operate on a daily schedule.
    (2) Manual PM<INF>2.5</INF> samplers at NCore stations and required 
regional background and regional transport sites must operate on at 
least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency.
    (3) Manual PM<INF>2.5</INF> speciation samplers at STN stations must 
operate on a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency.
    (e) For PM<INF>10</INF> samplers'a 24-hour sample must be taken from 
midnight to midnight (local time) to ensure national consistency. The 
minimum monitoring schedule for the site in the area of expected maximum 
concentration shall be based on the relative level of that monitoring 
site concentration with respect to the 24-hour standard as illustrated 
in Figure 1. If the operating agency demonstrates by monitoring data 
that during certain periods of the year conditions preclude violation of 
the PM<INF>10</INF> 24-hour standard, the increased sampling frequency 
for those periods or seasons may be exempted by the Regional 
Administrator and permitted to revert back to once in six days. The 
minimum sampling schedule for all other sites in the area remains once 
every six days. No less frequently than as part of each 5-year network 
assessment, the most recent year of data must be considered to estimate 
the air quality status at the site near the area of maximum 
concentration. Statistical

[[Page 235]]

models such as analysis of concentration frequency distributions as 
described in ``Guideline for the Interpretation of Ozone Air Quality 
Standards,'' EPA-450/479-003, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
Research Triangle Park, NC, January 1979, should be used. Adjustments to 
the monitoring schedule must be made on the basis of the 5-year network 
assessment. The site having the highest concentration in the most 
current year must be given first consideration when selecting the site 
for the more frequent sampling schedule. Other factors such as major 
change in sources of PM<INF>10</INF> emissions or in sampling site 
characteristics could influence the location of the expected maximum 
concentration site. Also, the use of the most recent 3 years of data 
might, in some cases, be justified in order to provide a more 
representative database from which to estimate current air quality 
status and to provide stability to the network. This multiyear 
consideration reduces the possibility of an anomalous year biasing a 
site selected for accelerated sampling. If the maximum concentration 
site based on the most current year is not selected for the more 
frequent operating schedule, documentation of the justification for 
selection of an alternative site must be submitted to the Regional 
Office for approval during the 5-year network assessment process. 
Minimum data completeness criteria, number of years of data and sampling 
frequency for judging attainment of the NAAQS are discussed in appendix 
K of part 50 of this chapter.

    (f) For manual PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> samplers:
    (1) Manual PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> samplers at NCore stations must 
operate on at least a 1-in-3 day schedule at sites without a collocated 
continuously operating federal equivalent PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> method 
that has been designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.
    (2) Manual PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> speciation samplers at NCore stations 
must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency.

without a collocated continuously operating PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitor 
must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day schedule.
    (ii) For SLAMS PM<INF>2.5</INF> sites with both manual and 
continuous PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitors operating, the monitoring agency 
may request approval for a reduction to 1-in-6 day PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
sampling or for seasonal sampling from the EPA Regional Administrator. 
The EPA Regional Administrator may grant sampling frequency reductions 
after consideration of factors, including but not limited to the 
historical PM<INF>2.5</INF> data quality assessments, the location of 
current PM<INF>2.5</INF> design value sites, and their regulatory data 
needs. Required SLAMS stations whose measurements determine the design 
value for their area and that are within plus or minus 10 percent of the 
NAAQS; and all required sites where one or more 24-hour values have 
exceeded the NAAQS each year for a consecutive period of at least 3 
years are required to maintain at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency. 
A continuously operating FEM or ARM PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitor satisfies 
this requirement.
    (iii) Required SLAMS stations whose measurements determine the 
design value for their area and that are within plus or minus 5 percent 
of the daily PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS must have an FRM or FEM operate on a 
daily schedule. A continuously operating FEM or ARM PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitor satisfies this requirement.

convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 58.12  Operating schedules.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR41AD07.012


<R05>
Sec. 58.13  Monitoring network completion.

    (a) The network of NCore multipollutant sites must be physically 
established no later than January 1, 2011, and at that time, operating 
under all of the requirements of this part, including the requirements 
of appendices A, C, D, E, and G to this part.
    (b) Where existing networks are not in conformance with required 
numbers of monitors specified in this part, additional required monitors 
must be operated by January 1, 2008.


<R05>
Sec. 58.14  System modification.

    (a) The State, or where appropriate local, agency shall develop and 
implement a plan and schedule to modify the ambient air quality 
monitoring network that complies with the findings of the network 
assessments required

[[Page 237]]

every 5 years by Sec. 58.10(e). The State or local agency shall consult 
with the EPA Regional Administrator during the development of the 
schedule to modify the monitoring program, and shall make the plan and 
schedule available to the public for 30 days prior to submission to the 
EPA Regional Administrator. The final plan and schedule with respect to 
the SLAMS network are subject to the approval of the EPA Regional 
Administrator. Plans containing modifications to NCore Stations or PAMS 
Stations shall be submitted to the Administrator. The Regional 
Administrator shall provide opportunity for public comment and shall 
approve or disapprove submitted plans and schedules within 120 days.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall preclude the State, or where 
appropriate local, agency from making modifications to the SLAMS network 
for reasons other than those resulting from the periodic network 
assessments. These modifications must be reviewed and approved by the 
Regional Administrator. Each monitoring network may make or be required 
to make changes between the 5-year assessment periods, including for 
example, site relocations or the addition of PAMS networks in bumped-up 
ozone nonattainment areas. These modifications must address changes 
invoked by a new census and changes due to changing air quality levels. 
The State, or where appropriate local, agency shall provide written 
communication describing the network changes to the Regional 
Administrator for review and approval as these changes are identified.
    (c) State, or where appropriate, local agency requests for SLAMS 
monitor station discontinuation, subject to the review of the Regional 
Administrator, will be approved if any of the following criteria are met 
and if the requirements of appendix D to this part, if any, continue to 
be met. Other requests for discontinuation may also be approved on a 
case-by-case basis if discontinuance does not compromise data collection 
needed for implementation of a NAAQS and if the requirements of appendix 
D to this part, if any, continue to be met.
    (1) Any PM<INF>2.5</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, CO, PM<INF>10</INF>, 
SO<INF>2</INF>, Pb, or NO<INF>2</INF> SLAMS monitor which has shown 
attainment during the previous five years, that has a probability of 
less than 10 percent of exceeding 80 percent of the applicable NAAQS 
during the next three years based on the levels, trends, and variability 
observed in the past, and which is not specifically required by an 
attainment plan or maintenance plan. In a nonattainment or maintenance 
area, if the most recent attainment or maintenance plan adopted by the 
State and approved by EPA contains a contingency measure to be triggered 
by an air quality concentration and the monitor to be discontinued is 
the only SLAMS monitor operating in the nonattainment or maintenance 
area, the monitor may not be discontinued.
    (2) Any SLAMS monitor for CO, PM<INF>10</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, or 
NO<INF>2</INF> which has consistently measured lower concentrations than 
another monitor for the same pollutant in the same county (or portion of 
a county within a distinct attainment area, nonattainment area, or 
maintenance area, as applicable) during the previous five years, and 
which is not specifically required by an attainment plan or maintenance 
plan, if control measures scheduled to be implemented or discontinued 
during the next five years would apply to the areas around both monitors 
and have similar effects on measured concentrations, such that the 
retained monitor would remain the higher reading of the two monitors 
being compared.
    (3) For any pollutant, any SLAMS monitor in a county (or portion of 
a county within a distinct attainment, nonattainment, or maintenance 
area, as applicable) provided the monitor has not measured violations of 
the applicable NAAQS in the previous five years, and the approved SIP 
provides for a specific, reproducible approach to representing the air 
quality of the affected county in the absence of actual monitoring data.
    (4) A PM<INF>2.5</INF> SLAMS monitor which EPA has determined cannot 
be compared to the relevant NAAQS because of the siting of the monitor, 
in accordance with Sec. 58.30.
    (5) A SLAMS monitor that is designed to measure concentrations 
upwind of an urban area for purposes of characterizing transport into 
the area

[[Page 238]]

and that has not recorded violations of the relevant NAAQS in the 
previous five years, if discontinuation of the monitor is tied to start-
up of another station also characterizing transport.
    (6) A SLAMS monitor not eligible for removal under any of the 
criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section may be 
moved to a nearby location with the same scale of representation if 
logistical problems beyond the State's control make it impossible to 
continue operation at its current site.


<R05>
Sec. 58.15  Annual air monitoring data certification.

    (a) The State, or where appropriate local, agency shall submit to 
the EPA Regional Administrator an annual air monitoring data 
certification letter to certify data collected at all SLAMS and at all 
FRM, FEM, and ARM SPM stations that meet criteria in appendix A to this 
part from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year. The senior air 
pollution control officer in each agency, or his or her designee, shall 
certify that the previous year of ambient concentration and quality 
assurance data are completely submitted to AQS and that the ambient 
concentration data are accurate to the best of her or his knowledge, 
taking into consideration the quality assurance findings.
    (1) Through 2009, the annual data certification letter is due by 
July 1 of each year.
    (2) Beginning in 2010, the annual data certification letter is due 
by May 1 of each year.
    (b) Along with each certification letter, the State shall submit to 
the Administrator (through the appropriate Regional Office) an annual 
summary report of all the ambient air quality data collected at all 
SLAMS and at SPM stations using FRM, FEM, or ARMs. The annual report(s) 
shall be submitted for data collected from January 1 to December 31 of 
the previous year. The annual summary report(s) must contain all 
information and data required by the State's approved plan and must be 
submitted on the same schedule as the certification letter, unless an 
approved alternative date is included in the plan. The annual summary 
serves as the record of the specific data that is the object of the 
certification letter.
    (c) Along with each certification letter, the State shall submit to 
the Administrator (through the appropriate Regional Office) a summary of 
the precision and accuracy data for all ambient air quality data 
collected at all SLAMS and at SPM stations using FRM, FEM, or ARMs. The 
summary of precision and accuracy shall be submitted for data collected 
from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year. The summary of 
precision and accuracy must be submitted on the same schedule as the 
certification letter, unless an approved alternative date is included in 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 58.16  Data submittal and archiving requirements.

    (a) The State, or where appropriate, local agency, shall report to 
the Administrator, via AQS all ambient air quality data and associated 
quality assurance data for SO<INF>2</INF>; CO; O<INF>3</INF>; 
NO<INF>2</INF>; NO; NO<INF>Y</INF>; NO<INF>X</INF>; Pb; PM<INF>10</INF> 
mass concentration; PM<INF>2.5</INF> mass concentration; for filter-
based PM<INF>2.5</INF> FRM/FEM the field blank mass, sampler-generated 
average daily temperature, and sampler-generated average daily pressure; 
chemically speciated PM<INF>2.5</INF> mass concentration data; 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> mass concentration; chemically speciated 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> mass concentration data; meteorological data from 
NCore and PAMS sites; and metadata records and information specified by 
the AQS Data Coding Manual (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/manuals/
manuals.htm). Such air quality data and information must be submitted 
directly to the AQS via electronic transmission on the specified 
quarterly schedule described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The specific quarterly reporting periods are January 1-March 31, 
April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31. The 
data and information reported for each reporting period must contain all 
data and information gathered during the reporting period, and be 
received in the AQS within 90 days after the end of the quarterly 
reporting period. For example, the data for the reporting period January 
1-March 31 are due on or before June 30 of that year.

[[Page 239]]

    (c) Air quality data submitted for each reporting period must be 
edited, validated, and entered into the AQS (within the time limits 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section) pursuant to appropriate AQS 
procedures. The procedures for editing and validating data are described 
in the AQS Data Coding Manual and in each monitoring agency's quality 
assurance project plan.
    (d) The State shall report VOC and if collected, carbonyl, 
NH<INF>3</INF>, and HNO<INF>3</INF> data, from PAMS sites to AQS within 
6 months following the end of each quarterly reporting period listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) The State shall also submit any portion or all of the SLAMS and 
SPM data to the appropriate Regional Administrator upon request.
    (f) The State, or where applicable, local agency shall archive all 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF>, and PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> filters from 
manual low-volume samplers (samplers having flow rates less than 200 
liters/minute) from all SLAMS sites for a minimum period of 1 year after 
collection. These filters shall be made available during the course of 
that year for supplemental analyses at the request of EPA or to provide 
information to State and local agencies on particulate matter 
composition. Other Federal agencies may request access to filters for 
purposes of supporting air quality management or community health--such 
as biological assay--through the applicable EPA Regional Administrator. 
The filters shall be archived according to procedures approved by the 
Administrator. The EPA recommends that particulate matter filters be 
archived for longer periods, especially for key sites in making NAAQS 
related decisions or for supporting health-related air pollution 
studies.

    Source: 71 FR 61302, Oct. 17, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 58.20  Special purpose monitors (SPM).

    (a) An SPM is defined as any monitor included in an agency's 
monitoring network that the agency has designated as a special purpose 
monitor in its annual monitoring network plan and in AQS, and which the 
agency does not count when showing compliance with the minimum 
requirements of this subpart for the number and siting of monitors of 
various types. Any SPM operated by an air monitoring agency must be 
included in the periodic assessments and annual monitoring network plan 
required by Sec. 58.10. The plan shall include a statement of purposes 
for each SPM monitor and evidence that operation of each monitor meets 
the requirements of appendix A or an approved alternative as provided by 
Sec. 58.11(a)(2) where applicable. The monitoring agency may designate 
a monitor as an SPM after January 1, 2007 only if it is a new monitor, 
i.e., a SLAMS monitor that is not included in the currently applicable 
monitoring plan or, for a monitor included in the monitoring plan prior 
to January 1, 2007, if the Regional Administrator has approved the 
discontinuation of the monitor as a SLAMS site.
    (b) Any SPM data collected by an air monitoring agency using a 
Federal reference method (FRM), Federal equivalent method (FEM), or 
approved regional method (ARM) must meet the requirements of Sec. 
58.11, Sec. 58.12, and appendix A to this part or an approved 
alternative to appendix A to this part. Compliance with appendix E to 
this part is optional but encouraged except when the monitoring agency's 
data objectives are inconsistent with those requirements. Data collected 
at an SPM using a FRM, FEM, or ARM meeting the requirements of appendix 
A must be submitted to AQS according to the requirements of Sec. 58.16. 
Data collected by other SPMs may be submitted. The monitoring agency 
must also submit to AQS an indication of whether each SPM reporting data 
to AQS monitor meets the requirements of appendices A and E to this 
part.
    (c) All data from an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM which has 
operated for more than 24 months is eligible for comparison to the 
relevant NAAQS, subject to the conditions of Sec. 58.30, unless the air 
monitoring agency demonstrates that the data came from a particular 
period during which the requirements of appendix A or an

[[Page 240]]

approved alternative, appendix C, or appendix E were not met in 
practice.
    (d) If an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM is discontinued within 24 
months of start-up, the Administrator will not base a NAAQS violation 
determination for the PM<INF>2.5</INF> or ozone NAAQS solely on data 
from the SPM.
    (e) If an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM is discontinued within 24 
months of start-up, the Administrator will not designate an area as 
nonattainment for the CO, SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, Pb, or 24-hour 
PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS solely on the basis of data from the SPM. Such 
data are eligible for use in determinations of whether a nonattainment 
area has attained one of these NAAQS.
    (f) Prior approval from EPA is not required for discontinuance of an 
SPM.

    Effective Date Note: At 72 FR 32210, June 12, 2007, Sec. 58.20(c)

<R05>
Sec. 58.30  Special considerations for data comparisons to the NAAQS.

    (a) Comparability of PM2.5 data. (1) There are two forms of the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS described in part 50 of this chapter. The 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring site characteristics (see appendix D to this 
part, section 4.7.1) impact how the resulting PM<INF>2.5</INF> data can 
be compared to the annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS form. PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
data that are representative, not of areawide but rather, of relatively 
unique population-oriented microscale, or localized hot spot, or unique 
population-oriented middle-scale impact sites are only eligible for 
comparison to the 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. For example, if the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring site is adjacent to a unique dominating 
local PM<INF>2.5</INF> source or can be shown to have average 24-hour 
concentrations representative of a smaller than neighborhood spatial 
scale, then data from a monitor at the site would only be eligible for 
comparison to the 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.
    (2) There are cases where certain population-oriented microscale or 
middle scale PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring sites are determined by the 
Regional Administrator to collectively identify a larger region of 
localized high ambient PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentrations. In those cases, 
data from these population-oriented sites would be eligible for 
comparison to the annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.

                         1. General Information

    This appendix specifies the minimum quality system requirements 
applicable to SLAMS air monitoring data and PSD data for the pollutants 
SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, CO, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, 
PM<INF>10</INF> and PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> submitted to EPA. This appendix 
also applies to all SPM stations using FRM, FEM, or ARM methods which 
also meet the requirements of Appendix E of this part. Monitoring 
organizations are encouraged to develop and maintain quality systems 
more extensive than the required minimums. The permit-granting authority 
for PSD may require more frequent or more stringent requirements. 
Monitoring organizations may, based on their quality objectives, develop 
and maintain quality systems beyond the required minimum. Additional 
guidance for the requirements reflected in this appendix can be found in 
the ``Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement 
Systems'', volume II, part 1 (see reference 10 of this appendix) and at 
a national level in references 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix.
    1.1 Similarities and Differences Between SLAMS and PSD Monitoring. 
In most cases, the quality assurance requirements for SLAMS, SPMs if 
applicable, and PSD are the same. Affected SPMs are subject to all the 
SLAMS requirements, even where not specifically stated in each section. 
Table A-1 of this appendix summarizes the major similarities and 
differences of the requirements for SLAMS and PSD. Both programs 
require:
    (a) The development, documentation, and implementation of an 
approved quality system;
    (b) The assessment of data quality;
    (c) The use of reference, equivalent, or approved methods. The 
requirements of this appendix do not apply to a SPM that does not use a 
FRM, FEM, or ARM;
    (d) The use of calibration standards traceable to NIST or other 
primary standard;
    (e) Performance evaluations and systems.
    1.1.1 The monitoring and quality assurance responsibilities for 
SLAMS are with the State or local agency, hereafter called the 
monitoring organization, whereas for PSD they are with the owner/
operator seeking the permit. The monitoring duration for SLAMS is 
indefinite, whereas for PSD the duration is usually 12 months. Whereas 
the reporting period for precision and accuracy data is on an annual or 
calendar quarter basis for SLAMS, it is on a continuing sampler quarter 
basis for PSD, since the monitoring may not commence at the beginning of 
a calendar quarter.
    1.1.2 The annual performance evaluations (described in section 3.2.2 
of this appendix) for PSD must be conducted by personnel different from 
those who perform routine span checks and calibrations, whereas for 
SLAMS, it is the preferred but not the required condition. For PSD, the 
evaluation rate is 100 percent of the sites per reporting quarter 
whereas for SLAMS it is 25 percent of the sites or instruments 
quarterly. Monitoring for sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and nitrogen 
dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) for PSD must be done with automated analyzers--
the manual bubbler methods are not permitted.
    1.1.3 The requirements for precision assessment for the automated 
methods are the same for both SLAMS and PSD. However, for manual 
methods, only one collocated site is required for PSD.
    1.1.4 The precision, accuracy and bias data for PSD are reported 
separately for each sampler (site), whereas for SLAMS, the report may be 
by sampler (site), by primary quality assurance organization, or 
nationally, depending on the pollutant. SLAMS data are required to be 
reported to the AQS, PSD data are required to be reported to the permit-
granting authority. Requirements in this appendix, with the exception of 
the differences discussed in this section, and in Table A-1 of this 
appendix will be expected to be followed by both SLAMS and PSD networks 
unless directly specified in a particular section.
    1.2 Measurement Uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty is a term used 
to describe deviations from a true concentration or estimate that are 
related to the measurement

[[Page 242]]

process and not to spatial or temporal population attributes of the air 
being measured. Monitoring organizations must develop quality assurance 
project plans (QAPP) which describe how the organization intends to 
control measurement uncertainty to an appropriate level in order to 
achieve the objectives for which the data are collected. The process by 
which one determines the quality of data needed to meet the monitoring 
objective is sometimes referred to the Data Quality Objectives Process. 
Data quality indicators associated with measurement uncertainty include:
    (a) Precision. A measurement of mutual agreement among individual 
measurements of the same property usually under prescribed similar 
conditions, expressed generally in terms of the standard deviation.
    (b) Bias. The systematic or persistent distortion of a measurement 
process which causes errors in one direction.
    (c) Accuracy. The degree of agreement between an observed value and 
an accepted reference value. Accuracy includes a combination of random 
error (imprecision) and systematic error (bias) components which are due 
to sampling and analytical operations.
    (d) Completeness. A measure of the amount of valid data obtained 
from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be 
obtained under correct, normal conditions.
    (e) Detectability. The low critical range value of a characteristic 
that a method specific procedure can reliably discern.
    1.3 Measurement Quality Checks. The SLAMS measurement quality checks 
described in sections 3.2 and 3.3 of this appendix shall be reported to 
AQS and are included in the data required for certification. The PSD 
network is required to implement the measurement quality checks and 
submit this information quarterly along with assessment information to 
the permit-granting authority.
    1.4 Assessments and Reports. Periodic assessments and documentation 
of data quality are required to be reported to EPA or to the permit 
granting authority (PSD). To provide national uniformity in this 
assessment and reporting of data quality for all networks, specific 
assessment and reporting procedures are prescribed in detail in sections 
3, 4, and 5 of this appendix. On the other hand, the selection and 
extent of the quality assurance and quality control activities used by a 
monitoring organization depend on a number of local factors such as 
field and laboratory conditions, the objectives for monitoring, the 
level of data quality needed, the expertise of assigned personnel, the 
cost of control procedures, pollutant concentration levels, etc. 
Therefore, quality system requirements in section 2 of this appendix are 
specified in general terms to allow each monitoring organization to 
develop a quality system that is most efficient and effective for its 
own circumstances while achieving the data quality objectives required 
for the SLAMS sites.

                     2. Quality System Requirements

    A quality system is the means by which an organization manages the 
quality of the monitoring information it produces in a systematic, 
organized manner. It provides a framework for planning, implementing, 
assessing and reporting work performed by an organization and for 
carrying out required quality assurance and quality control activities.
    2.1 Quality Management Plans and Quality Assurance Project Plans. 
All monitoring organizations must develop a quality system that is 
described and approved in quality management plans (QMP) and quality 
assurance project plans (QAPP) to ensure that the monitoring results:
    (a) Meet a well-defined need, use, or purpose;
    (b) Provide data of adequate quality for the intended monitoring 
objectives;
    (c) Satisfy stakeholder expectations;
    (d) Comply with applicable standards specifications;
    (e) Comply with statutory (and other) requirements of society; and
    (f) Reflect consideration of cost and economics.
    2.1.1 The QMP describes the quality system in terms of the 
organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and 
staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, 
implementing, assessing and reporting activities involving environmental 
data operations (EDO). The QMP must be suitably documented in accordance 
with EPA requirements (reference 2 of this appendix), and approved by 
the appropriate Regional Administrator, or his or her representative. 
The quality system will be reviewed during the systems audits described 
in section 2.5 of this appendix. Organizations that implement long-term 
monitoring programs with EPA funds should have a separate QMP document. 
Smaller organizations or organizations that do infrequent work with EPA 
funds may combine the QMP with the QAPP based on negotiations with the 
funding agency. Additional guidance on this process can be found in 
reference 10 of this appendix. Approval of the recipient's QMP by the 
appropriate Regional Administrator or his or her representative, may 
allow delegation of the authority to review and approve the QAPP to the 
recipient, based on adequacy of quality assurance procedures described 
and documented in the QMP. The QAPP will be reviewed by EPA during 
systems audits or circumstances related to data quality.

[[Page 243]]

    2.1.2 The QAPP is a formal document describing, in sufficient 
detail, the quality system that must be implemented to ensure that the 
results of work performed will satisfy the stated objectives. The 
quality assurance policy of the EPA requires every environmental data 
operation (EDO) to have a written and approved QAPP prior to the start 
of the EDO. It is the responsibility of the monitoring organization to 
adhere to this policy. The QAPP must be suitably documented in 
accordance with EPA requirements (reference 3 of this appendix).
    2.1.3 The monitoring organization's quality system must have 
adequate resources both in personnel and funding to plan, implement, 
assess and report on the achievement of the requirements of this 
appendix and its approved QAPP.
    2.2 Independence of Quality Assurance. The monitoring organization 
must provide for a quality assurance management function- that aspect of 
the overall management system of the organization that determines and 
implements the quality policy defined in a monitoring organization's 
QMP. Quality management includes strategic planning, allocation of 
resources and other systematic planning activities (e.g., planning, 
implementation, assessing and reporting) pertaining to the quality 
system. The quality assurance management function must have sufficient 
technical expertise and management authority to conduct independent 
oversight and assure the implementation of the organization's quality 
system relative to the ambient air quality monitoring program and should 
be organizationally independent of environmental data generation 
activities.
    2.3. Data Quality Performance Requirements.
    2.3.1 Data Quality Objectives. Data quality objectives (DQO) or the 
results of other systematic planning processes are statements that 
define the appropriate type of data to collect and specify the tolerable 
levels of potential decision errors that will be used as a basis for 
establishing the quality and quantity of data needed to support the 
objectives of the SLAMS stations. DQO will be developed by EPA to 
support the primary SLAMS objectives for each criteria pollutant. As 
they are developed they will be added to the regulation. DQO or the 
results of other systematic planning processes for PSD or other 
monitoring will be the responsibility of the monitoring organizations. 
The quality of the conclusions made from data interpretation can be 
affected by population uncertainty (spatial or temporal uncertainty) and 
measurement uncertainty (uncertainty associated with collecting, 
analyzing, reducing and reporting concentration data). This appendix 
focuses on assessing and controlling measurement uncertainty.
    2.3.1.1 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated and Manual 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement 
uncertainty is defined as 10 percent coefficient of variation (CV) for 
total precision and plus or minus 10 percent for total bias.
    2.3.1.2 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated Ozone Methods. The 
goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as 
an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient variation (CV) 
of 7 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for 
the absolute bias of 7 percent.
    2.3.1.3 Measurement Uncertainty for PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> Methods. The 
goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as 
an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient variation (CV) 
of 15 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for 
the absolute bias of 15 percent.
    2.4 National Performance Evaluation Programs. Monitoring plans or 
the QAPP shall provide for the implementation of a program of 
independent and adequate audits of all monitors providing data for SLAMS 
and PSD including the provision of adequate resources for such audit 
programs. A monitoring plan (or QAPP) which provides for monitoring 
organization participation in EPA's National Performance Audit Program 
(NPAP) and the PM Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) program and which 
indicates the consent of the monitoring organization for EPA to apply an 
appropriate portion of the grant funds, which EPA would otherwise award 
to the monitoring organization for monitoring activities, will be deemed 
by EPA to meet this requirement. For clarification and to participate, 
monitoring organizations should contact either the appropriate EPA 
Regional Quality Assurance (QA) Coordinator at the appropriate EPA 
Regional Office location, or the NPAP Coordinator, Emissions Monitoring 
and Analysis Division (D205-02), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
    2.5 Technical Systems Audit Program. Technical systems audits of 
each ambient air monitoring organization shall be conducted at least 
every 3 years by the appropriate EPA Regional Office and reported to the 
AQS. Systems audit programs are described in reference 10 of this 
appendix. For further instructions, monitoring organizations should 
contact the appropriate EPA Regional QA Coordinator.
    2.6 Gaseous and Flow Rate Audit Standards.
    2.6.1 Gaseous pollutant concentration standards (permeation devices 
or cylinders of compressed gas) used to obtain test concentrations for 
carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen oxide 
(NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) must be traceable to either 
a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Traceable 
Reference Material

[[Page 244]]

(NTRM) or a NIST-certified Gas Manufacturer's Internal Standard (GMIS), 
certified in accordance with one of the procedures given in reference 4 
of this appendix. Vendors advertising certification with the procedures 
provided in reference 4 of this appendix and distributing gasses as 
``EPA Protocol Gas'' must participate in the EPA Protocol Gas 
Verification Program or not use ``EPA'' in any form of advertising.
    2.6.2 Test concentrations for ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) must be obtained 
in accordance with the ultra violet photometric calibration procedure 
specified in appendix D to part 50 of this chapter, or by means of a 
certified O<INF>3</INF> transfer standard. Consult references 7 and 8 of 
this appendix for guidance on primary and transfer standards for 
O<INF>3</INF>.
    2.6.3 Flow rate measurements must be made by a flow measuring 
instrument that is traceable to an authoritative volume or other 
applicable standard. Guidance for certifying some types of flowmeters is 
provided in reference 10 of this appendix.
    2.7 Primary Requirements and Guidance. Requirements and guidance 
documents for developing the quality system are contained in references 
1 through 10 of this appendix, which also contain many suggested 
procedures, checks, and control specifications. Reference 10 of this 
appendix describes specific guidance for the development of a quality 
system for SLAMS. Many specific quality control checks and 
specifications for methods are included in the respective reference 
methods described in part 50 of this chapter or in the respective 
equivalent method descriptions available from EPA (reference 6 of this 
appendix). Similarly, quality control procedures related to specifically 
designated reference and equivalent method analyzers are contained in 
the respective operation or instruction manuals associated with those 
analyzers.

                3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements

    This section provides the requirements for primary quality assurance 
organizations (PQAOs) to perform the measurement quality checks that can 
be used to assess data quality. With the exception of the flow rate 
verifications (sections 3.2.3 and 3.3.2 of this appendix), data from 
these checks are required to be submitted to the AQS within the same 
time frame as routine ambient concentration data. Section 3.2 of this 
appendix describes checks of automated or continuous instruments while 
section 3.3 describe checks associated with manual sampling instruments. 
Other quality control samples are identified in the various references 
described earlier and can be used to control certain aspects of the 
measurement system.
    3.1 Primary Quality Assurance Organization. A primary quality 
assurance organization is defined as a monitoring organization or a 
coordinated aggregation of such organizations that is responsible for a 
set of stations that monitors the same pollutant and for which data 
quality assessments can logically be pooled. Each criteria pollutant 
sampler/monitor at a monitoring station in the SLAMS network must be 
associated with one, and only one, primary quality assurance 
organization.
    3.1.1 Each primary quality assurance organization shall be defined 
such that measurement uncertainty among all stations in the organization 
can be expected to be reasonably homogeneous, as a result of common 
factors. Common factors that should be considered by monitoring 
organizations in defining primary quality assurance organizations 
include:
    (a) Operation by a common team of field operators according to a 
common set of procedures;
    (b) Use of a common QAPP or standard operating procedures;
    (c) Common calibration facilities and standards;
    (d) Oversight by a common quality assurance organization; and
    (e) Support by a common management, laboratory or headquarters.
    3.1.2 Primary quality assurance organizations are not necessarily 
related to the organization reporting data to the AQS. Monitoring 
organizations having difficulty in defining the primary quality 
assurance organizations or in assigning specific sites to primary 
quality assurance organizations should consult with the appropriate EPA 
Regional Office. All definitions of primary quality assurance 
organizations shall be subject to final approval by the appropriate EPA 
Regional Office during scheduled network reviews or systems audits.
    3.1.3 Data quality assessment results shall be reported as specified 
in section 5 of this appendix.
    3.2 Measurement Quality Checks of Automated Methods. Table A-2 of 
this appendix provides a summary of the types and frequency of the 
measurement quality checks that will be described in this section.
    3.2.1 One-Point Quality Control Check for SO<INF>2</INF>, 
NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, and CO. A one-point quality control (QC) 
check must be performed at least once every 2 weeks on each automated 
analyzer used to measure SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF> 
and CO. The frequency of QC checks may be reduced based upon review, 
assessment and approval of the EPA Regional Administrator. However, with 
the advent of automated calibration systems more frequent checking is 
encouraged. See Reference 10 of this appendix for guidance on the review 
procedure. The QC check is made by challenging the analyzer with a QC 
check gas of known concentration (effective concentration for open path 
analyzers) between 0.01 and 0.10 parts per million (ppm) for 
SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, and O<INF>3</INF>, and

[[Page 245]]

between 1 and 10 ppm for CO analyzers. The ranges allow for appropriate 
check gas selection for SLAMS sites that may be sampling for different 
objectives, i.e., trace gas monitoring vs. comparison to National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The QC check gas concentration 
selected should be related to the routine concentrations normally 
measured at sites within the monitoring network in order to 
appropriately reflect the precision and bias at these routine 
concentration ranges. To check the precision and bias of SLAMS analyzers 
operating at ranges either above or below the levels identified, use 
check gases of appropriate concentrations as approved by the appropriate 
EPA Regional Administrator or their designee. The standards from which 
check concentrations are obtained must meet the specifications of 
section 2.6 of this appendix.
    3.2.1.1 Except for certain CO analyzers described below, point 
analyzers must operate in their normal sampling mode during the QC 
check, and the test atmosphere must pass through all filters, scrubbers, 
conditioners and other components used during normal ambient sampling 
and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable. If 
permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, a CO point 
analyzer may be temporarily modified during the QC check to reduce vent 
or purge flows, or the test atmosphere may enter the analyzer at a point 
other than the normal sample inlet, provided that the analyzer's 
response is not likely to be altered by these deviations from the normal 
operational mode. If a QC check is made in conjunction with a zero or 
span adjustment, it must be made prior to such zero or span adjustments.
    3.2.1.2 Open path analyzers are tested by inserting a test cell 
containing a QC check gas concentration into the optical measurement 
beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, 
receiver, and as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during 
the test and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument 
should be altered as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for 
the test. However, if permitted by the associated operation or 
instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate 
optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring 
path may be used. The actual concentration of the QC check gas in the 
test cell must be selected to produce an effective concentration in the 
range specified earlier in this section. Generally, the QC test 
concentration measurement will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant 
concentration and the QC test concentration. If so, the result must be 
corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The 
corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the 
atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under 
test immediately before and immediately after the QC test from the QC 
check gas concentration measurement. If the difference between these 
before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the 
effective concentration of the test gas, discard the test result and 
repeat the test. If possible, open path analyzers should be tested 
during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are 
relatively low and steady.
    3.2.1.3 Report the audit concentration (effective concentration for 
open path analyzers) of the QC gas and the corresponding measured 
concentration (corrected concentration, if applicable, for open path 
analyzers) indicated by the analyzer. The percent differences between 
these concentrations are used to assess the precision and bias of the 
monitoring data as described in sections 4.1.2 (precision) and 4.1.3 
(bias) of this appendix.
    3.2.2 Annual performance evaluation for SO<INF>2</INF>, 
NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, or CO. Each calendar quarter (during 
which analyzers are operated), evaluate at least 25 percent of the SLAMS 
analyzers that monitor for SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, 
O<INF>3</INF>, or CO such that each analyzer is evaluated at least once 
per year. If there are fewer than four analyzers for a pollutant within 
a primary quality assurance organization, it is suggested to randomly 
evaluate one or more analyzers so that at least one analyzer for that 
pollutant is evaluated each calendar quarter. The evaluation should be 
conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine 
site operator.
    3.2.2.1 (a) The evaluation is made by challenging the analyzer with 
audit gas standard of known concentration (effective concentration for 
open path analyzers) from at least three consecutive audit levels. The 
audit levels selected should represent or bracket 80 percent of ambient 
concentrations measured by the analyzer being evaluated:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 246]]

    (b) An additional 4th level is encouraged for those monitors that 
have the potential for exceeding the concentration ranges described by 
the initial three selected.
    3.2.2.2 (a) NO<INF>2</INF> audit gas for chemiluminescence-type 
NO<INF>2</INF> analyzers must also contain at least 0.08 ppm NO. NO 
concentrations substantially higher than 0.08 ppm, as may occur when 
using some gas phase titration (GPT) techniques, may lead to evaluation 
errors in chemiluminescence analyzers due to inevitable minor NO-
NO<INF>X</INF> channel imbalance. Such errors may be atypical of routine 
monitoring errors to the extent that such NO concentrations exceed 
typical ambient NO concentrations at the site. These errors may be 
minimized by modifying the GPT technique to lower the NO concentrations 
remaining in the NO<INF>2</INF> audit gas to levels closer to typical 
ambient NO concentrations at the site.
    (b) To evaluate SLAMS analyzers operating on ranges higher than 0 to 
1.0 ppm for SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, and O<INF>3</INF> or 0 to 50 
ppm for CO, use audit gases of appropriately higher concentration as 
approved by the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator or the 
Administrator's designee.
    3.2.2.3 The standards from which audit gas test concentrations are 
obtained must meet the specifications of section 2.6 of this appendix. 
The gas standards and equipment used for evaluations must not be the 
same as the standards and equipment used for calibration or calibration 
span adjustments. For SLAMS sites, the auditor should not be the 
operator or analyst who conducts the routine monitoring, calibration, 
and analysis. For PSD sites the auditor must not be the operator or 
analyst who conducts the routine monitoring, calibration, and analysis.
    3.2.2.4 For point analyzers, the evaluation shall be carried out by 
allowing the analyzer to analyze the audit gas test atmosphere in its 
normal sampling mode such that the test atmosphere passes through all 
filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other sample inlet components used 
during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet 
system as is practicable. The exception provided in section 3.2.1 of 
this appendix for certain CO analyzers does not apply for evaluations.
    3.2.2.5 Open path analyzers are evaluated by inserting a test cell 
containing the various audit gas concentrations into the optical 
measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used 
transmitter, receiver, and, as appropriate, reflecting devices should be 
used during the evaluation, and the normal monitoring configuration of 
the instrument should be modified as little as possible to accommodate 
the test cell for the evaluation. However, if permitted by the 
associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light 
source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal 
atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentrations of 
the audit gas in the test cell must be selected to produce effective 
concentrations in the evaluation level ranges specified in this section 
of this appendix. Generally, each evaluation concentration measurement 
result will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and 
the evaluation test concentration. If so, the result must be corrected 
to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected 
concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric 
concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test 
immediately before and immediately after the evaluation test (or 
preferably before and after each evaluation concentration level) from 
the evaluation concentration measurement. If the difference between the 
before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the 
effective concentration of the test gas standard, discard the test 
result for that concentration level and repeat the test for that level. 
If possible, open path analyzers should be evaluated during periods when 
the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady. 
Also, if the open path instrument is not installed in a permanent 
manner, the monitoring path length must be reverified to within plus or 
minus 3 percent to validate the evaluation, since the monitoring path 
length is critical to the determination of the effective concentration.
    3.2.2.6 Report both the evaluation concentrations (effective 
concentrations for open path analyzers) of the audit gases and the 
corresponding measured concentration (corrected concentrations, if 
applicable, for open path analyzers) indicated or produced by the 
analyzer being tested. The percent differences between these 
concentrations are used to assess the quality of the monitoring data as 
described in section 4.1.4 of this appendix.
    3.2.3 Flow Rate Verification for Particulate Matter. A one-point 
flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month 
on each automated analyzer used to measure PM<INF>10</INF>, 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> and PM<INF>2.5</INF>. The verification is made by 
checking the operational flow rate of the analyzer. If the verification 
is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made 
prior to such flow rate adjustment. Randomization of the flow rate 
verification with respect to time of day, day of week, and routine 
service and adjustments is encouraged where possible. For the standard 
procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance 
with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the analyzer's normal flow 
rate. Care should be used in selecting and using the flow rate 
measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow 
rate of the analyzer. Report the flow rate of

[[Page 247]]

the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured 
(indicated) by the analyzer. The percent differences between the audit 
and measured flow rates are used to assess the bias of the monitoring 
data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in 
lieu of concentrations).
    3.2.4 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for Particulate Matter. Every 6 
months, audit the flow rate of the PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> 
and PM<INF>2.5</INF> particulate analyzers. Where possible, EPA strongly 
encourages more frequent auditing. The audit should (preferably) be 
conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine 
site operator. The audit is made by measuring the analyzer's normal 
operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in 
accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard 
used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used to 
calibrate the analyzer. However, both the calibration standard and the 
audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume 
standard. Great care must be used in auditing the flow rate to be 
certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal 
operating flow rate of the analyzer. Report the audit flow rate of the 
transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured (indicated) 
by the analyzer. The percent differences between these flow rates are 
used to validate the one-point flow rate verification checks used to 
estimate bias as described in section 4.2.3 of this appendix.
    3.2.5 Collocated Sampling Procedures for PM<INF>2.5.</INF> For each 
pair of collocated monitors, designate one sampler as the primary 
monitor whose concentrations will be used to report air quality for the 
site, and designate the other as the audit monitor.
    3.2.5.1 Each EPA designated Federal reference method (FRM) or 
Federal equivalent method (FEM) within a primary quality assurance 
organization must:
    (a) Have 15 percent of the monitors collocated (values of 0.5 and 
greater round up); and
    (b) Have at least 1 collocated monitor (if the total number of 
monitors is less than 3). The first collocated monitor must be a 
designated FRM monitor.
    3.2.5.2 In addition, monitors selected for collocation must also 
meet the following requirements:
    (a) A primary monitor designated as an EPA FRM shall be collocated 
with an audit monitor having the same EPA FRM method designation.
    (b) For each primary monitor model designated as an EPA FEM used by 
the PQAO, 50 percent of the monitors designated for collocation shall be 
collocated with an audit monitor having the same method designation and 
50 percent of the monitors shall be collocated with an FRM audit 
monitor. If the primary quality assurance organization only has one FEM 
monitor it shall be collocated with an FRM audit monitor. If there are 
an odd number of collocated monitors required, the additional monitor 
shall be an FRM audit monitor. An example of this procedure is found in 
Table A-3 of this appendix.
    3.2.5.3 The collocated monitors should be deployed according to the 
following protocol:
    (a) 80 percent of the collocated audit monitors should be deployed 
at sites with annual average or daily concentrations estimated to be 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20 percent of the applicable NAAQS and the 
remainder at what the monitoring organizations designate as high value 
sites;
    (b) If an organization has no sites with annual average or daily 
concentrations within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 20 percent of the annual 
NAAQS (or 24-hour NAAQS if that is affecting the area), 60 percent of 
the collocated audit monitors should be deployed at those sites with the 
annual mean concentrations (or 24-hour NAAQS if that is affecting the 
area) among the highest 25 percent for all sites in the network.
    3.2.5.4 In determining the number of collocated sites required for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>, monitoring networks for visibility assessments should 
not be treated independently from networks for particulate matter, as 
the separate networks may share one or more common samplers. However, 
for Class I visibility areas, EPA will accept visibility aerosol mass 
measurement instead of a PM<INF>2.5</INF> measurement if the latter 
measurement is unavailable. Any PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring site which 
does not have a monitor which is an EPA FRM, FEM or ARM is not required 
to be included in the number of sites which are used to determine the 
number of collocated monitors.
    3.2.5.5 For each PSD monitoring network, one site must be 
collocated. A site with the predicted highest 24-hour pollutant 
concentration must be selected.
    3.2.5.6 The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each 
other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 
liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less 
than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. Calibration, 
sampling, and analysis must be the same for both collocated samplers and 
the same as for all other samplers in the network.
    3.2.5.7 Sample the collocated audit monitor for SLAMS sites on a 12-
day schedule; sample PSD sites on a 6-day schedule or every third day 
for PSD daily monitors. If a primary quality assurance organization has 
only one collocated monitor, higher sampling frequencies than the 12-day 
schedule may be needed in order to produce about 25 valid sample pairs a 
year. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated audit 
monitors at each collocated sampling site. The calculations for 
evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors

[[Page 248]]

are described in section 4.3.1 of this appendix.
    3.2.6 Collocated Sampling Procedures for PM<INF>10-2.5.</INF> For 
the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> network, all automated methods must be 
designated as Federal equivalent methods (FEMs). For each pair of 
collocated monitors, designate one sampler as the primary monitor whose 
concentrations will be used to report air quality for the site, and 
designate the other as the audit monitor.
    3.2.6.1 The EPA shall ensure that each EPA designated FEM within the 
national PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> monitoring network must:
    (a) Have 15 percent of the monitors collocated (values of 0.5 and 
greater round up); and
    (b) Have at least 2 collocated monitors (if the total number of 
monitors is less than 10). The first collocated monitor must be a 
designated FRM monitor and the second must be a monitor of the same 
method designation. Both collocated FRM and FEM monitors can be located 
at the same site.
    3.2.6.2 The Regional Administrator for the EPA Regions where the 
FEMs are implemented will select the sites for collocated monitoring. 
The site selection process shall consider giving priority to sites at 
primary quality assurance organizations or States with more than one 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> site, sites considered important from a regional 
perspective, and sites needed for an appropriate distribution among 
rural and urban NCore sites. Depending on the speed at which the 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> network is deployed, the first sites implementing 
FEMs shall be required to perform collocation until there is a larger 
distribution of FEM monitors implemented in the network.
    3.2.6.3 The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each 
other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 
liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less 
than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. Calibration, 
sampling, and analysis must be the same for both collocated samplers and 
the same as for all other samplers in the network.
    3.2.6.4 Sample the collocated audit monitor for SLAMS sites on a 12-
day schedule. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated 
audit monitors at each collocated sampling site. The calculations for 
evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described 
in section 4.3.1 of this appendix.
    3.2.7 PM<INF>2.5</INF> Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) 
Procedures. The PEP is an independent assessment used to estimate total 
measurement system bias. These evaluations will be performed under the 
PM Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) (section 2.4 of this appendix) 
or a comparable program. Performance evaluations will be performed on 
the SLAMS monitors annually within each primary quality assurance 
organization. For primary quality assurance organizations with less than 
or equal to five monitoring sites, five valid performance evaluation 
audits must be collected and reported each year. For primary quality 
assurance organizations with greater than five monitoring sites, eight 
valid performance evaluation audits must be collected and reported each 
year. A valid performance evaluation audit means that both the primary 
monitor and PEP audit concentrations are valid and above 3 [micro]g/
m\3\. Additionally, each year, every designated FRM or FEM within a 
primary quality assurance organization must:
    (1) Have each method designation evaluated each year; and,
    (2) Have all FRM or FEM samplers subject to a PEP audit at least 
once every six years; which equates to approximately 15 percent of the 
monitoring sites audited each year.
    (b) Additional information concerning the Performance Evaluation 
Program is contained in reference 10 of this appendix. The calculations 
for evaluating bias between the primary monitor and the performance 
evaluation monitor for PM<INF>2.5</INF> are described in section 4.3.2 
of this appendix.
    3.2.8 PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> Performance Evaluation Program. For the 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> network, all automated methods will be designated as 
federal equivalent methods (FEMs). One performance evaluation audit, as 
described in section 3.2.7 must be performed at one PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> 
site in each primary quality assurance organization each year. The 
calculations for evaluating bias between the primary monitor(s) and the 
performance evaluation monitors for PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> are described in 
section 4.1.3 of this appendix.
    3.3 Measurement Quality Checks of Manual Methods. Table A-2 of this 
appendix provides a summary of the types and frequency of the 
measurement quality checks that will be described in this section.
    3.3.1 Collocated Sampling Procedures for PM<INF>10</INF>. For each 
network of manual PM<INF>10</INF> methods, select 15 percent (or at 
least one) of the monitoring sites within the primary quality assurance 
organization for collocated sampling. For purposes of precision 
assessment, networks for measuring total suspended particulate (TSP) and 
PM<INF>10</INF> shall be considered separately from one another. 
However, PM<INF>10</INF> samplers used in the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> 
network, may be counted along with the PM<INF>10</INF> samplers in the 
PM<INF>10</INF> network as long as the PM<INF>10</INF> samplers in both 
networks are the same method designation. PM<INF>10</INF> and TSP sites 
having annual mean particulate matter concentrations among the highest 
25 percent of the annual mean concentrations for all the sites in the 
network must be selected or, if such sites are impractical, alternative 
sites approved by the EPA Regional Administrator may be selected.

[[Page 249]]

    3.3.1.1 In determining the number of collocated sites required for 
PM<INF>10</INF>, monitoring networks for lead (Pb) should be treated 
independently from networks for particulate matter (PM), even though the 
separate networks may share one or more common samplers. However, a 
single pair of samplers collocated at a common-sampler monitoring site 
that meets the requirements for both a collocated Pb site and a 
collocated PM site may serve as a collocated site for both networks.
    3.3.1.2 The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each 
other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 
liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less 
than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. Calibration, 
sampling, analysis and verification/validation procedures must be the 
same for both collocated samplers and the same as for all other samplers 
in the network.
    3.3.1.3 For each pair of collocated samplers, designate one sampler 
as the primary sampler whose samples will be used to report air quality 
for the site, and designate the other as the audit sampler. Sample SLAMS 
sites on a 12-day schedule; sample PSD sites on a 6-day schedule or 
every third day for PSD daily samplers. If a primary quality assurance 
organization has only one collocated monitor, higher sampling 
frequencies than the 12-day schedule may be needed in order to produce 
approximately 25 valid sample pairs a year. Report the measurements from 
both samplers at each collocated sampling site. The calculations for 
evaluating precision between the two collocated samplers are described 
in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.
    3.3.2 Flow Rate Verification for Particulate Matter. Follow the same 
procedure as described in section 3.2.3 of this appendix for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF> (low-volume instruments), and 
PM<INF>10-2.5.</INF> High-volume PM<INF>10</INF> and TSP instruments can 
also follow the procedure in section 3.2.3 but the audits are required 
to be conducted quarterly. The percent differences between the audit and 
measured flow rates are used to assess the bias of the monitoring data 
as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix.
    3.3.3 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for Particulate Matter. Follow the 
same procedure as described in section 3.2.4 of this appendix for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> and TSP 
instruments. The percent differences between these flow rates are used 
to validate the one-point flow rate verification checks used to estimate 
bias as described in section 4.2.3 of this appendix. Great care must be 
used in auditing high-volume particulate matter samplers having flow 
regulators because the introduction of resistance plates in the audit 
flow standard device can cause abnormal flow patterns at the point of 
flow sensing. For this reason, the flow audit standard should be used 
with a normal filter in place and without resistance plates in auditing 
flow-regulated high-volume samplers, or other steps should be taken to 
assure that flow patterns are not perturbed at the point of flow 
sensing.
    3.3.4 Pb Methods.
    3.3.4.1 Annual Flow Rate. For the Pb Reference Method (40 CFR part 
50, appendix G), the flow rates of the high-volume Pb samplers shall be 
verified and audited using the same procedures described in sections 
3.3.2 and 3.3.3 of this appendix.
    3.3.4.2 Pb Strips. Each calendar quarter or sampling quarter (PSD), 
audit the Pb Reference Method analytical procedure using glass fiber 
filter strips containing a known quantity of Pb. These audit sample 
strips are prepared by depositing a Pb solution on unexposed glass fiber 
filter strips of dimensions 1.9 centimeters (cm) by 20.3 cm (\3/4\ inch 
by 8 inch) and allowing them to dry thoroughly. The audit samples must 
be prepared using batches of reagents different from those used to 
calibrate the Pb analytical equipment being audited. Prepare audit 
samples in the following concentration ranges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      Equivalent ambient
              Range                Pb concentration,   Pb concentration,
                                    [micro]g/strip       [micro]g/m3 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1...............................             100-300             0.5-1.5
2...............................           400-1,000            3.0-5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Equivalent ambient Pb concentration in [micro]/m\3\ is based on
  sampling at 1.7 m\3\/min for 24 hours on a 20.3 cm x 25.4 cm (8 inch x
  10 inch) glass fiber filter.

    (a) Audit samples must be extracted using the same extraction 
procedure used for exposed filters.
    (b) Analyze three audit samples in each of the two ranges each 
quarter samples are analyzed. The audit sample analyses shall be 
distributed as much as possible over the entire calendar quarter.
    (c) Report the audit concentrations (in [micro]g Pb/strip) and the 
corresponding measured concentrations (in [micro]g Pb/strip) using AQS 
unit code 077. The relative percent differences between the 
concentrations are used to calculate analytical accuracy as described in 
section 4.4.2 of this appendix.
    (d) The audits of an equivalent Pb method are conducted and assessed 
in the same manner as for the reference method. The flow auditing device 
and Pb analysis audit samples must be compatible with the specific 
requirements of the equivalent method.
    3.3.5 Collocated Sampling Procedures for PM<INF>2.5.</INF> Follow 
the same procedure as described in section 3.2.5 of this appendix. 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> samplers used in the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> network, may 
be counted along with the PM<INF>2.5</INF> samplers in the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> network as long as the PM<INF>2.5</INF> samplers in 
both networks are the same method designation.
    3.3.6 Collocated Sampling Procedures for PM<INF>10-2.5</INF>. All 
designated FRMs within the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> monitoring network must 
have 15

[[Page 250]]

percent of the monitors collocated (values of 0.5 and greater round up) 
at the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> sites. All FRM method designations can be 
aggregated.
    3.3.6.1 The EPA shall ensure that each designated FEM within the 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> monitoring network must:
    (a) Have 15 percent of the monitors collocated (values of 0.5 and 
greater round up); and
    (b) Have at least 2 collocated monitors (if the total number of 
monitors is less than 10). The first collocated monitor must be a 
designated FRM monitor and the second must be a monitor of the same 
method designation. Both collocated FRM and FEM monitors can be located 
at the same site.
    3.3.6.2 The Regional Administrator for the EPA Region where the FRM 
or FEMs are implemented will select the sites for collocated monitoring. 
The collocation site selection process shall consider sites at primary 
quality assurance organizations or States with more than one 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> site; primary quality assurance organizations 
already monitoring for PM<INF>10</INF> and PM<INF>2.5</INF> using FRMs 
or FEMs; and an appropriate distribution among rural and urban NCore 
sites. Monitoring organizations implementing PM<INF>10</INF> samplers 
and PM<INF>2.5</INF> FRM samplers of the same method designation as the 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> FRM can include the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> monitors in 
their respective PM<INF>10</INF> and PM<INF>2.5</INF> count. Follow the 
same procedures as described in sections 3.2.6.2 and 3.2.6.3 of this 
appendix.
    3.3.7 PM<INF>2.5</INF> Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) 
Procedures. Follow the same procedure as described in section 3.2.7 of 
this appendix.
    3.3.8 PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) 
Procedures. One performance evaluation audit, as described in section 
3.2.7 of this appendix must be performed at one PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> site 
in each primary quality assurance organization each year. Monitoring 
organizations implementing PM<INF>2.5</INF> FRM samplers of the same 
method designation in both the PM<INF>2.5</INF> and the 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> networks can include the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> 
performance evaluation audit in their respective PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
performance evaluation count as long as the performance evaluation is 
conducted at the PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> site. The calculations for 
evaluating bias between the primary monitor(s) and the performance 
evaluation monitors for PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> are described in section 
4.1.3 of this appendix.

               4. Calculations for Data Quality Assessment

    (a) Calculations of measurement uncertainty are carried out by EPA 
according to the following procedures. Primary quality assurance 
organizations should report the data for all appropriate measurement 
quality checks as specified in this appendix even though they may elect 
to perform some or all of the calculations in this section on their own.
    (b) The EPA will provide annual assessments of data quality 
aggregated by site and primary quality assurance organization for 
SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF> and CO and by primary 
quality assurance organization for PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> and Pb.
    (c) At low concentrations, agreement between the measurements of 
collocated samplers, expressed as relative percent difference or percent 
difference, may be relatively poor. For this reason, collocated 
measurement pairs are selected for use in the precision and bias 
calculations only when both measurements are equal to or above the 
following limits:
(1) TSP: 20 [micro]g/m\3\.
(2) Pb: 0.15 [micro]g/m\3\.
(3) PM<INF>10</INF> (Hi-Vol): 15 [micro]g/m\3\.
(4) PM<INF>10</INF> (Lo-Vol): 3 [micro]g/m\3\.
(5) PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> and PM<INF>2.5</INF>: 3 [micro]g/m\3\.

    4.1 Statistics for the Assessment of QC Checks for SO<INF>2</INF>, 
NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF> and CO.
    4.1.1 Percent Difference. All measurement quality checks start with 
a comparison of an audit concentration or value (flowrate) to the 
concentration/value measured by the analyzer and use percent difference 
as the comparison statistic as described in equation 1 of this section. 
For each single point check, calculate the percent difference, di, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.041

where, meas is the concentration indicated by the monitoring 
organization's instrument and audit is the audit concentration of the 
standard used in the QC check being measured.
    4.1.2 Precision Estimate. The precision estimate is used to assess 
the one-point QC checks for SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, 
O<INF>3</INF>, or CO described in section 3.2.1 of this appendix. The 
precision estimator is the coefficient of variation upper bound and is 
calculated using equation 2 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.042

where, X\2\<INF>0.1,n-1</INF> is the 10th percentile of a chi-squared 
distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.
    4.1.3 Bias Estimate. The bias estimate is calculated using the one-
point QC checks for SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, or CO 
described in section 3.2.1

[[Page 251]]

of this appendix and the performance evaluation program for 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> described in sections 3.2.8 and 3.3.8 of this 
appendix. The bias estimator is an upper bound on the mean absolute 
value of the percent differences as described in equation 3 of this 
section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.043

where, n is the number of single point checks being aggregated; 
t<INF>0.95,n-1</INF> is the 95th quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 
degrees of freedom; the quantity AB is the mean of the absolute values 
of the di's and is calculated using equation 4 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.044

and the quantity AS is the standard deviation of the absolute value of 
the di's and is calculated using equation 5 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.045

    4.1.3.1 Assigning a sign (positive/negative) to the bias estimate. 
Since the bias statistic as calculated in equation 3 of this appendix 
uses absolute values, it does not have a tendency (negative or positive 
bias) associated with it. A sign will be designated by rank ordering the 
percent differences of the QC check samples from a given site for a 
particular assessment interval.
    4.1.3.2 Calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles of the percent 
differences for each site. The absolute bias upper bound should be 
flagged as positive if both percentiles are positive and negative if 
both percentiles are negative. The absolute bias upper bound would not 
be flagged if the 25th and 75th percentiles are of different signs.
    4.1.4 Validation of Bias Using the one-point QC Checks. The annual 
performance evaluations for SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, 
O<INF>3</INF>, or CO described in section 3.2.2 of this appendix are 
used to verify the results obtained from the one-point QC checks and to 
validate those results across a range of concentration levels. To 
quantify this annually at the site level and at the 3-year primary 
quality assurance organization level, probability limits will be 
calculated from the one-point QC checks using equations 6 and 7 of this 
appendix:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.064

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.065

where, m is the mean (equation 8 of this appendix):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.046

where, k is the total number of one point QC checks for the interval 
          being evaluated and S is the standard deviation of the percent 
          differences (equation 9 of this appendix) as follows:
          [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.047
          
    4.1.5 Percent Difference. Percent differences for the performance 
evaluations, calculated using equation 1 of this appendix can be 
compared to the probability intervals for the respective site or at the 
primary quality assurance organization level. Ninety-five percent of the 
individual percent differences (all audit concentration levels) for the 
performance evaluations should be captured within the probability 
intervals for the primary quality assurance organization.
    4.2 Statistics for the Assessment of PM<INF>10</INF>.
    4.2.1 Precision Estimate from Collocated Samplers. Precision is 
estimated via duplicate measurements from collocated samplers of the 
same type. It is recommended that the precision be aggregated at the 
primary quality assurance organization level quarterly, annually, and at 
the 3-year level. The data pair would only be considered valid if both 
concentrations are greater than the minimum values specified in section 
4(c) of this appendix. For each collocated data pair, calculate the 
relative percent difference, di, using equation 10 of this appendix:

where, Xi is the concentration from the primary sampler and Yi is the 
          concentration

          value from the audit sampler. The coefficient of variation 
          upper bound is calculated using the equation 11 of this 
          appendix:
          [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.049
          
where, n is the number of valid data pairs being aggregated, and X 
          \2\<INF>0.1.n-1</INF> is the 10th percentile of a chi-squared 
          distribution with n1 degrees of freedom. The factor of 2 in 
          the denominator adjusts for the fact that each di is 
          calculated from two values with error.
4.2.2 Bias Estimate Using One-Point Flow Rate Verifications. For each 
          one-point flow rate verification described in sections 3.2.3 
          and 3.3.2 of this appendix, calculate the percent difference 
          in volume using equation 1 of this appendix where meas is the 
          value indicated by the sampler's volume measurement and audit 
          is the actual volume indicated by the auditing flow meter. The 
          absolute volume bias upper bound is then calculated using 
          equation 3, where n is the number of flow rate audits being 
          aggregated; t<INF>0.95,n-1</INF> is the 95th quantile of a t-
          distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, the quantity AB is 
          the mean of the absolute values of the di's and is calculated 
          using equation 4 of this appendix , and the quantity AS in 
          equation 3 of this appendix is the standard deviation of the 
          absolute values if the di's and is calculated using equation 5 
          of this
    4.2.3 Assessment Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audits. The flow rate audits 
described in sections 3.2.4 and 3.3.3 of this appendix are used to 
assess the results obtained from the one-point flow rate verifications 
and to provide an estimate of flow rate acceptability. For each flow 
rate audit, calculate the percent difference in volume using equation 1 
of this appendix where meas is the value indicated by the sampler's 
volume measurement and audit is the actual volume indicated by the 
auditing flow meter. To quantify this annually and at the 3-year primary 
quality assurance organization level, probability limits are calculated 
from the percent differences using equations 6 and 7 of this appendix 
where m is the mean described in equation 8 of this appendix and k is 
the total number of one-point flow rate verifications for the year and S 
is the standard deviation of the percent differences as described in 
equation 9 of this appendix.
    4.2.4 Percent Difference. Percent differences for the annual flow 
rate audit concentration, calculated using equation 1 of this appendix, 
can be compared to the probability intervals for the one-point flow rate 
verifications for the respective primary quality assurance organization. 
Ninety-five percent of the individual percent differences (all audit 
concentration levels) for the performance evaluations should be captured 
within the probability intervals for primary quality assurance 
organization.
    4.3 Statistics for the Assessment of PM<INF>2.5</INF> and 
PM<INF>10-2.5.</INF>
    4.3.1 Precision Estimate. Precision for collocated instruments for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> and PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> may be estimated where both the 
primary and collocated instruments are the same method designation and 
when the method designations are not similar. Follow the procedure 
described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix. In addition, one may want 
to perform an estimate of bias when the primary monitor is an FEM and 
the collocated monitor is an FRM. Follow the procedure described in 
section 4.1.3 of this appendix in order to provide an estimate of bias 
using the collocated data.
    4.3.2 Bias Estimate. Follow the procedure described in section 4.1.3 
of this appendix for the bias estimate of PM<INF>10-2.5.</INF> The 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> bias estimate is calculated using the paired routine 
and the PEP monitor data described in section 3.2.6 of this appendix. 
Calculate the percent difference, di, using equation 1 of this appendix, 
where meas is the measured concentration from agency's primary monitor 
and audit is the concentration from the PEP monitor. The data pair would 
only be considered valid if both concentrations are greater than the 
minimum values specified in section 4(c) of this appendix. Estimates of 
bias are presented for various levels of aggregation, sometimes 
aggregating over time, sometimes aggregating over samplers, and 
sometimes aggregating over both time and samplers. These various levels 
of aggregation are achieved using the same basic statistic.
    4.3.2.1 This statistic averages the individual biases described in 
equation 1 of this appendix to the desired level of aggregation using 
equation 12 of this appendix:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.050

    where, nj is the number of pairs and d<INF>1</INF>, d<INF>2</INF>, 
d<INF>nj</INF> are the biases for each of the pairs to be averaged.
    4.3.2.2 Confidence intervals can be constructed for these average 
bias estimates in equation 12 of this appendix using equations 13 and 14 
of this appendix:

[[Page 253]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.051

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.052

    Where, t<INF>0.95,df</INF> is the 95th quantile of a t-distribution 
with degrees of freedom df = n<INF>j</INF> - 1 and s is an estimate of 
the variability of the average bias calculated using equation 15 of this 
appendix:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.053

    4.4 Statistics for the Assessment of Pb.
    4.4.1 Precision Estimate. Follow the same procedures as described 
for PM<INF>10</INF> in section 4.2.1 of this appendix using the data 
from the collocated instruments. The data pair would only be considered 
valid if both concentrations are greater than the minimum values 
specified in section 4(c) of this appendix.
    4.4.2 Bias Estimate. In order to estimate bias, the information from 
the flow rate audits and the Pb strip audits needs to be combined as 
described below. To be consistent with the formulas for the gases, the 
recommended procedures are to work with relative errors of the lead 
measurements. The relative error in the concentration is related to the 
relative error in the volume and the relative error in the mass 
measurements using equation 16 of this appendix:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.054

    As with the gases, an upper bound for the absolute bias is desired. 
Using equation 16 above, the absolute value of the relative 
(concentration) error is bounded by equation 17 of this appendix:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.055

    The quality indicator data collected are then used to bound each 
part of equation 17 separately.
    4.4.2.1 Flow rate calculations. For each flow rate audit, calculate 
the percent difference in volume by equation 1 of this appendix where 
meas is the value indicated by the sampler's volume measurement and 
audit is the actual volume indicated by the auditing flow meter. The 
absolute volume bias

[[Page 254]]

upper bound is then calculated using equation 3 of this appendix where n 
is the number of flow rate audits being aggregated; t<INF>0.95,n-1</INF> 
is the 95th quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom; 
the quantity AB is the mean of the absolute values of the di's and is 
calculated using equation 4, and the quantity AS in equation 3 of this 
appendix is the standard deviation of the absolute values of the di's 
and is calculated using equation 5 of this appendix.
    4.4.2.2 Lead strip calculations. Similarly for each lead strip 
audit, calculate the percent difference in mass by equation 1 where meas 
is the value indicated by the mass measurement and audit is the actual 
lead mass on the audit strip. The absolute mass bias upper bound is then 
calculated using equation 3 of this appendix where n is the number of 
lead strip audits being aggregated; t<INF>0.95,n-1</INF> is the 95th 
quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom; the quantity 
AB is the mean of the absolute values of the di's and is calculated 
using equation 4 of this appendix and the quantity AS in equation 3 of 
this appendix is the standard deviation of the absolute values of the 
di's and is calculated using equation 5 of this appendix.
    4.4.2.3 Final bias calculation. Finally, the absolute bias upper 
bound is given by combining the absolute bias estimates of the flow rate 
and Pb strips using equation 18 of this appendix:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.056

where, the numerator and denominator have been multiplied by 100 since 
everything is expressed as a percentage.
    4.5 Time Period for Audits. The statistics in this section assume 
that the mass and flow rate audits represent the same time period. Since 
the two types of audits are not performed at the same time, the audits 
need to be grouped by common time periods. Consequently, the absolute 
bias estimates should be done on annual and 3-year levels. The flow rate 
audits are site-specific, so the absolute bias upper bound estimate can 
be done and treated as a site-level statistic.

                        5. Reporting Requirements

    5.1 SLAMS Reporting Requirements. For each pollutant, prepare a list 
of all monitoring sites and their AQS site identification codes in each 
primary quality assurance organization and submit the list to the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office, with a copy to AQS. Whenever there is a 
change in this list of monitoring sites in a primary quality assurance 
organization, report this change to the EPA Regional Office and to AQS.
    5.1.1 Quarterly Reports. For each quarter, each primary quality 
assurance organization shall report to AQS directly (or via the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office for organizations not direct users of 
AQS) the results of all valid measurement quality checks it has carried 
out during the quarter. The quarterly reports must be submitted 
consistent with the data reporting requirements specified for air 
quality data as set forth in Sec. 58.16. The EPA strongly encourages 
early submission of the quality assurance data in order to assist the 
monitoring organizations control and evaluate the quality of the ambient 
air data.
    5.1.2 Annual Reports.
    5.1.2.1 When the monitoring organization has certified relevant data 
for the calendar year, EPA will calculate and report the measurement 
uncertainty for the entire calendar year.
    5.2 PSD Reporting Requirements. At the end of each sampling quarter, 
the organization must report the appropriate statistical assessments in 
section 4 of this appendix for the pollutants measured. All data used to 
calculate reported estimates of precision and bias including span 
checks, collocated sampler and audit results must be made available to 
the permit granting authority upon request.

1.0 Purpose
2.0 SLAMS Ambient Air Monitoring Stations
3.0 NCore Ambient Air Monitoring Stations
4.0 Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS)
5.0 Particulate Matter Episode Monitoring
6.0 References

                               1.0 Purpose

    This appendix specifies the criteria pollutant monitoring methods 
(manual methods or automated analyzers) which must be used in SLAMS and 
NCore stations that are a subset of SLAMS.

                2.0 SLAMS Ambient Air Monitoring Network

    2.1 Except as otherwise provided in this appendix, a criteria 
pollutant monitoring method used for making NAAQS decisions at a SLAMS 
site must be a reference or equivalent method as defined in Sec. 50.1 
of this chapter.
    2.2 Reserved
    2.3 Any manual method or analyzer purchased prior to cancellation of 
its reference or equivalent method designation under Sec. 53.11 or 
Sec. 53.16 of this chapter may be used at a SLAMS site following 
cancellation for a reasonable period of time to be determined by the 
Administrator.
    2.4 Approval of Non-designated Continuous PM<INF>2.5</INF> Methods 
as Approved Regional Methods (ARMs) Operated Within a Network of Sites. 
A method for PM<INF>2.5</INF> that has not been designated as an FRM or 
FEM as defined in Sec. 50.1 of this chapter may be approved as an ARM 
for purposes of section 2.1 of this appendix at a particular site or 
network of sites under the following stipulations.
    2.4.1 The candidate ARM must be demonstrated to meet the 
requirements for PM<INF>2.5</INF> Class III equivalent methods as 
defined in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. Specifically the 
requirements for precision, correlation, and additive and multiplicative 
bias apply. For purposes of this section 2.4, the following requirements 
shall apply:
    2.4.1.1 The candidate ARM shall be tested at the site(s) in which it 
is intended to be used. For a network of sites operated by one reporting 
agency or primary quality assurance organization, the testing shall 
occur at a subset of sites to include one site in each MSA/CSA, up to 
the first 2 highest population MSA/CSA and at least one rural area or 
Micropolitan Statistical Area site. If the candidate ARM for a network 
is already approved for purposes of this section in another agency's 
network, subsequent testing shall minimally occur at one site in a MSA/
CSA and one rural area or Micropolitan Statistical Area. There shall be 
no requirement for tests at any other sites.
    2.4.1.2 For purposes of this section, a full year of testing may 
begin and end in any season, so long as all seasons are covered.
    2.4.1.3 No PM<INF>10</INF> samplers shall be required for the test, 
as determination of the PM<INF>2.5</INF>/PM<INF>10</INF> ratio at the 
test site shall not be required.
    2.4.1.4 The test specification for PM<INF>2.5</INF> Class III 
equivalent method precision defined

[[Page 259]]

in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter applies; however, there is no 
specific requirement that collocated continuous monitors be operated for 
purposes of generating a statistic for coefficient of variation (CV). To 
provide an estimate of precision that meets the requirement identified 
in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter, agencies may cite peer-reviewed 
published data or data in AQS that can be presented demonstrating the 
candidate ARM operated will produce data that meets the specification 
for precision of Class III PM<INF>2.5</INF> methods.
    2.4.1.5 A minimum of 90 valid sample pairs per site for the year 
with no less than 20 valid sample pairs per season must be generated for 
use in demonstrating that additive bias, multiplicative bias and 
correlation meet the comparability requirements specified in subpart C 
of part 53 of this chapter. A valid sample pair may be generated with as 
little as one valid FRM and one valid candidate ARM measurement per day.
    2.4.1.6 For purposes of determining bias, FRM data with 
concentrations less than 3 micrograms per cubic meter ([micro]g/m\3\) 
may be excluded. Exclusion of data does not result in failure of sample 
completeness specified in this section.
    2.4.1.7 Data transformations are allowed to be used to demonstrate 
meeting the comparability requirements specified in subpart C of part 53 
of this chapter. Data transformation may be linear or non-linear, but 
must be applied in the same way to all sites used in the testing.
    2.4.2 The monitoring agency wishing to use an ARM must develop and 
implement appropriate quality assurance procedures for the method. 
Additionally, the following procedures are required for the method:
    2.4.2.1 The ARM must be consistently operated throughout the 
network. Exceptions to a consistent operation must be approved according 
to section 2.8 of this appendix;
    2.4.2.2 The ARM must be operated on an hourly sampling frequency 
capable of providing data suitable for aggregation into daily 24-hour 
average measurements;
    2.4.2.3 The ARM must use an inlet and separation device, as needed, 
that are already approved in either the reference method identified in 
appendix L to part 50 of this chapter or under part 53 of this chapter 
as approved for use on a PM<INF>2.5</INF> reference or equivalent 
method. The only exceptions to this requirement are those methods that 
by their inherent measurement principle may not need an inlet or 
separation device that segregates the aerosol; and
    2.4.2.4 The ARM must be capable of providing for flow audits, unless 
by its inherent measurement principle, measured flow is not required. 
These flow audits are to be performed on the frequency identified in 
appendix A to this part.
    2.4.2.5 If data transformations are used, they must be described in 
the monitoring agencies Quality Assurance Project plan (or addendum to 
QAPP). The QAPP shall describe how often (e.g., quarterly, yearly) and 
under what provisions the data transformation will be updated. For 
example, not meeting the data quality objectives for a site over a 
season or year may be cause for recalculating a data transformation, but 
by itself would not be cause for invalidating the data. Data 
transformations must be applied prospectively, i.e., in real-time or 
near real-time, to the data output from the PM<INF>2.5</INF> continuous 
method. See reference 7 of this appendix.
    2.4.3 The monitoring agency wishing to use the method must develop 
and implement appropriate procedures for assessing and reporting the 
precision and accuracy of the method comparable to the procedures set 
forth in appendix A of this part for designated reference and equivalent 
methods.
    2.4.4 Assessments of data quality shall follow the same frequencies 
and calculations as required under section 3 of appendix A to this part 
with the following exceptions:
    2.4.4.1 Collocation of ARM with FRM/FEM samplers must be maintained 
at a minimum of 30 percent of the required SLAMS sites with a minimum of 
1 per network;
    2.4.4.2 All collocated FRM/FEM samplers must maintain a sample 
frequency of at least 1 in 6 sample days;
    2.4.4.3 Collocated FRM/FEM samplers shall be located at the design 
value site, with the required FRM/FEM samplers deployed among the 
largest MSA/CSA in the network, until all required FRM/FEM are deployed; 
and
    2.4.4.4 Data from collocated FRM/FEM are to be substituted for any 
calendar quarter that an ARM method has incomplete data.
    2.4.4.5 Collocation with an ARM under this part for purposes of 
determining the coefficient of variation of the method shall be 
conducted at a minimum of 7.5 percent of the sites with a minimum of 1 
per network. This is consistent with the requirements in appendix A to 
this part for one-half of the required collocation of FRM/FEM (15 
percent) to be collocated with the same method.
    2.4.4.6 Assessments of bias with an independent audit of the total 
measurement system shall be conducted with the same frequency as an FEM 
as identified in appendix A to this part.
    2.4.5 Request for approval of a candidate ARM, that is not already 
approved in another agency's network under this section, must meet the 
general submittal requirements of section 2.7 of this appendix. Requests 
for approval under this section when an ARM is already approved in 
another agency's network are to be submitted to the EPA

candidate ARM will be used and tested, and a description of the nature 
or character of the site and the particulate matter that is expected to 
occur there.
    2.4.5.2 A detailed description of the method and the nature of the 
sampler or analyzer upon which it is based.
    2.4.5.3 A brief statement of the reason or rationale for requesting 
the approval.
    2.4.5.4 A detailed description of the quality assurance procedures 
that have been developed and that will be implemented for the method.

section 2.4.1 through 2.4.1.4 of this appendix.
    2.4.5.7 Such further supplemental information as may be necessary or 
helpful to support the required statements and test results.
    2.4.6 Within 120 days after receiving a request for approval of the 
use of an ARM at a particular site or network of sites under section 2.4 
of this appendix, the Administrator will approve or disapprove the 
method by letter to the person or agency requesting such approval. When 
appropriate for methods that are already approved in another SLAMS 
network, the EPA Regional Administrator has approval/disapproval 
authority. In either instance, additional information may be requested 
to assist with the decision.
    2.5 [Reserved]
    2.6 Use of Methods With Higher, Nonconforming Ranges in Certain 
Geographical Areas.
    2.6.1 [Reserved]
    2.6.2 An analyzer may be used (indefinitely) on a range which 
extends to concentrations higher than two times the upper limit 
specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter if:
    2.6.2.1 The analyzer has more than one selectable range and has been 
designated as a reference or equivalent method on at least one of its 
ranges, or has been approved for use under section 2.5 (which applies to 
analyzers purchased before February 18, 1975);
    2.6.2.2 The pollutant intended to be measured with the analyzer is 
likely to occur in concentrations more than two times the upper range 
limit specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter in the 
geographical area in which use of the analyzer is proposed; and
    2.6.2.3 The Administrator determines that the resolution of the 
range or ranges for which approval is sought is adequate for its 
intended use. For purposes of this section (2.6), ``resolution'' means 
the ability of the analyzer to detect small changes in concentration.
    2.6.3 Requests for approval under section 2.6.2 of this appendix 
must meet the submittal requirements of section 2.7. Except as provided 
in section 2.7.3 of this appendix, each request must contain the

    2.6.3.5 Test data or other information demonstrating the resolution 
of each proposed range that is broader than that permitted by section 
2.5 of this appendix.
    2.6.4 Any person who has obtained approval of a request under this 
section (2.6.2) shall assure that the analyzer for which approval was 
obtained is used only in the geographical area identified in the request 
and only while operated in the range or ranges specified in the request.
    2.7 Requests for Approval; Withdrawal of Approval.
    2.7.1 Requests for approval under sections 2.4, 2.6.2, or 2.8 of 
this appendix must be submitted to: Director, National Exposure Research 
Laboratory (MD-D205-03), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research 
Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711. For ARM that are already approved 
in another agency's network, subsequent requests for approval under 
section 2.4 are to be submitted to the applicable EPA Regional 
Administrator.
    2.7.2 Except as provided in section 2.7.3 of this appendix, each 
request must contain:
    2.7.2.1 A statement identifying the analyzer (e.g., by serial 
number) and the method of which the analyzer is representative (e.g., by 
manufacturer and model number); and
    2.7.2.2 Test data, records, calculations, and test results for the 
analyzer (or the method of which the analyzer is representative) as 
specified in subpart B, subpart C, or both (as applicable) of part 53 of 
this chapter.
    2.7.3 A request may concern more than one analyzer or geographical 
area and may incorporate by reference any data or other

[[Page 261]]

information known to EPA from one or more of the following:
    2.7.3.1 An application for a reference or equivalent method 
determination submitted to EPA for the method of which the analyzer is 
representative, or testing conducted by the applicant or by EPA in 
connection with such an application;
    2.7.3.2 Testing of the method of which the analyzer is 
representative at the initiative of the Administrator under Sec. 53.7 
of this chapter; or
    2.7.3.3 A previous or concurrent request for approval submitted to 
EPA under this section (2.7).
    2.7.4 To the extent that such incorporation by reference provides 
data or information required by this section (2.7) or by sections 2.4, 
2.5, or 2.6 of this appendix, independent data or duplicative 
information need not be submitted.
    2.7.5 After receiving a request under this section (2.7), the 
Administrator may request such additional testing or information or 
conduct such tests as may be necessary in his judgment for a decision on 
the request.
    2.7.6 If the Administrator determines, on the basis of any available 
information, that any of the determinations or statements on which 
approval of a request under this section was based are invalid or no 
longer valid, or that the requirements of section 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6, as 
applicable, have not been met, he/she may withdraw the approval after 
affording the person who obtained the approval an opportunity to submit 
information and arguments opposing such action.
    2.8 Modifications of Methods by Users.
    2.8.1 Except as otherwise provided in this section, no reference 
method, equivalent method, or ARM may be used in a SLAMS network if it 
has been modified in a manner that could significantly alter the 
performance characteristics of the method without prior approval by the 
Administrator. For purposes of this section, ``alternative method'' 
means an analyzer, the use of which has been approved under section 2.4, 
2.5, or 2.6 of this appendix or some combination thereof.
    2.8.2 Requests for approval under this section (2.8) must meet the 
submittal requirements of sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2.1 of this appendix.
    2.8.3 Each request submitted under this section (2.8) must include:
    2.8.3.1 A description, in such detail as may be appropriate, of the 
desired modification;
    2.8.3.2 A brief statement of the purpose(s) of the modification, 
including any reasons for considering it necessary or advantageous;
    2.8.3.3 A brief statement of belief concerning the extent to which 
the modification will or may affect the performance characteristics of 
the method; and
    2.8.3.4 Such further information as may be necessary to explain and 
support the statements required by sections 2.8.3.2 and 2.8.3.3.
    2.8.4 The Administrator will approve or disapprove the modification 
by letter to the person or agency requesting such approval within 75 
days after receiving a request for approval under this section and any 
further information that the applicant may be asked to provide.
    2.8.5 A temporary modification that could alter the performance 
characteristics of a reference, equivalent, or ARM may be made without 
prior approval under this section if the method is not functioning or is 
malfunctioning, provided that parts necessary for repair in accordance 
with the applicable operation manual cannot be obtained within 45 days. 
Unless such temporary modification is later approved under section 2.8.4 
of this appendix, the temporarily modified method shall be repaired in 
accordance with the applicable operation manual as quickly as 
practicable but in no event later than 4 months after the temporary 
modification was made, unless an extension of time is granted by the 
Administrator. Unless and until the temporary modification is approved, 
air quality data obtained with the method as temporarily modified must 
be clearly identified as such when submitted in accordance with Sec. 
58.16 and must be accompanied by a report containing the information 
specified in section 2.8.3 of this appendix. A request that the 
Administrator approve a temporary modification may be submitted in 
accordance with sections 2.8.1 through 2.8.4 of this appendix. In such 
cases the request will be considered as if a request for prior approval 
had been made.
    2.9 Use of IMPROVE Samplers at a SLAMS Site. ``IMPROVE'' samplers 
may be used in SLAMS for monitoring of regional background and regional 
transport concentrations of fine particulate matter. The IMPROVE 
samplers were developed for use in the Interagency Monitoring of 
Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network to characterize all of 
the major components and many trace constituents of the particulate 
matter that impair visibility in Federal Class I Areas. Descriptions of 
the IMPROVE samplers and the data they collect are available in 
references 4, 5, and 6 of this appendix.

                3.0 NCore Ambient Air Monitoring Stations

    3.1 Methods employed in NCore multipollutant sites used to measure 
SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, NO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, or 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> must be reference or equivalent methods as defined 
in Sec. 50.1 of this chapter, or an ARM as defined in section 2.4 of 
this appendix, for any monitors intended for comparison with applicable 
NAAQS.
    3.2 If alternative SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, NO<INF>2</INF>, 
O<INF>3</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, or PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> monitoring 
methodologies are proposed for monitors not intended for

[[Page 262]]

NAAQS comparison, such techniques must be detailed in the network 
description required by Sec. 58.10 and subsequently approved by the 
Administrator. Examples of locations that are not intended to be 
compared to the NAAQS may be rural background and transport sites or 
areas where the concentration of the pollutant is so low that it would 
be more useful to operate a higher sensitivity method that is not an FRM 
or FEM.

         4.0 Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS)

    4.1 Methods used for O<INF>3</INF> monitoring at PAMS must be 
automated reference or equivalent methods as defined in Sec. 50.1 of 
this chapter.
    4.2 Methods used for NO, NO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> 
monitoring at PAMS should be automated reference or equivalent methods 
as defined for NO<INF>2</INF> in Sec. 50.1 of this chapter. If 
alternative NO, NO<INF>2</INF> or NO<INF>X</INF> monitoring 
methodologies are proposed, such techniques must be detailed in the 
network description required by Sec. 58.10 and subsequently approved by 
the Administrator.
    4.3 Methods for meteorological measurements and speciated VOC 
monitoring are included in the guidance provided in references 2 and 3 
of this appendix. If alternative VOC monitoring methodology (including 
the use of new or innovative technologies), which is not included in the 
guidance, is proposed, it must be detailed in the network description 
required by Sec. 58.10 and subsequently approved by the Administrator.

                5.0 Particulate Matter Episode Monitoring

    5.1 For short-term measurements of PM<INF>10</INF> during air 
pollution episodes (see Sec. 51.152 of this chapter) the measurement 
method must be:
    5.1.1 Either the ``Staggered PM<INF>10</INF>'' method or the 
``PM<INF>10</INF> Sampling Over Short Sampling Times'' method, both of 
which are based on the reference method for PM<INF>10</INF> and are 
described in reference 1: or
    5.1.2 Any other method for measuring PM<INF>10</INF>:
    5.1.2.1 Which has a measurement range or ranges appropriate to 
accurately measure air pollution episode concentration of 
PM<INF>10</INF>,
    5.1.2.2 Which has a sample period appropriate for short-term 
PM<INF>10</INF> measurements, and
    5.1.2.3 For which a quantitative relationship to a reference or 
equivalent method for PM<INF>10</INF> has been established at the use 
site. Procedures for establishing a quantitative site-specific 
relationship are contained in reference 1.
    5.2 PM<INF>10</INF> methods other than the reference method are not 
covered under the quality assessment requirements of appendix to this 
part. Therefore, States must develop and implement their own quality 
assessment procedures for those methods allowed under this section 4. 
These quality assessment procedures should be similar or analogous to 
those described in section 3 of appendix A to this part for the 
PM<INF>10</INF> reference method.

               1. Monitoring Objectives and Spatial Scales

    The purpose of this appendix is to describe monitoring objectives 
and general criteria to be applied in establishing the required SLAMS 
ambient air quality monitoring stations and for choosing general 
locations for additional monitoring sites. This appendix also describes 
specific requirements for the number and location of FRM, FEM, and ARM 
sites for specific pollutants, NCore multipollutant sites, 
PM<INF>10</INF> mass sites, PM<INF>2.5</INF> mass sites, chemically-
speciated PM<INF>2.5</INF> sites, and O<INF>3</INF> precursor 
measurements sites (PAMS). These criteria will be used by EPA in 
evaluating the adequacy of the air pollutant monitoring networks.
    1.1 Monitoring Objectives. The ambient air monitoring networks must 
be designed to meet three basic monitoring objectives. These basic 
objectives are listed below. The appearance of any one objective in the 
order of this list is not based upon a prioritized scheme. Each 
objective is important and must be considered individually.
    (a) Provide air pollution data to the general public in a timely 
manner. Data can be presented to the public in a number of attractive 
ways including through air quality maps, newspapers, Internet sites, and 
as part of weather forecasts and public advisories.
    (b) Support compliance with ambient air quality standards and 
emissions strategy development. Data from FRM, FEM, and ARM monitors for 
NAAQS pollutants will be used for comparing an area's air pollution 
levels against the NAAQS. Data from monitors of various types can be 
used in the development of attainment and maintenance plans. SLAMS, and 
especially NCore station data, will be used to evaluate the regional air 
quality models used in developing emission strategies, and to track 
trends in air pollution abatement control measures' impact on improving 
air quality. In monitoring locations near major air pollution sources, 
source-oriented monitoring data can provide insight into how well 
industrial sources are controlling their pollutant emissions.
    (c) Support for air pollution research studies. Air pollution data 
from the NCore network can be used to supplement data collected by 
researchers working on health effects assessments and atmospheric 
processes, or for monitoring methods development work.
    1.1.1 In order to support the air quality management work indicated 
in the three basic air monitoring objectives, a network must be designed 
with a variety of types of monitoring sites. Monitoring sites must be 
capable of informing managers about many things including the peak air 
pollution levels, typical levels in populated areas, air pollution 
transported into and outside of a city or region, and air pollution 
levels near specific sources. To summarize some of these sites, here is 
a listing of six general site types:
    (a) Sites located to determine the highest concentrations expected 
to occur in the area covered by the network.
    (b) Sites located to measure typical concentrations in areas of high 
population density.
    (c) Sites located to determine the impact of significant sources or 
source categories on air quality.
    (d) Sites located to determine general background concentration 
levels.
    (e) Sites located to determine the extent of regional pollutant 
transport among populated areas; and in support of secondary standards.
    (f) Sites located to measure air pollution impacts on visibility, 
vegetation damage, or other welfare-based impacts.
    1.1.2 This appendix contains criteria for the basic air monitoring 
requirements. The total number of monitoring sites that will serve the 
variety of data needs will be substantially higher than these minimum 
requirements provide. The optimum size of a particular network involves 
trade-offs among data needs and available resources. This regulation 
intends to provide for national air monitoring needs, and to lend 
support for the flexibility necessary to meet data collection needs of 
area air quality managers. The EPA, State, and local agencies will 
periodically collaborate on network design issues through the network 
assessment process outlined in Sec. 58.10.
    1.1.3 This appendix focuses on the relationship between monitoring 
objectives, site types, and the geographic location of monitoring sites. 
Included are a rationale and set of general criteria for identifying 
candidate site locations in terms of physical characteristics which most 
closely match a specific monitoring objective. The criteria for more 
specifically locating the monitoring site, including spacing from 
roadways and vertical and horizontal probe and path placement, are 
described in appendix E to this part.
    1.2 Spatial Scales. (a) To clarify the nature of the link between 
general monitoring objectives, site types, and the physical location of 
a particular monitor, the concept of spatial scale of representativeness 
is defined. The goal in locating monitors is to correctly match the 
spatial scale represented by the sample of monitored air with the 
spatial scale most appropriate for the monitoring site type, air 
pollutant to be measured, and the monitoring objective.

[[Page 264]]

    (b) Thus, spatial scale of representativeness is described in terms 
of the physical dimensions of the air parcel nearest to a monitoring 
site throughout which actual pollutant concentrations are reasonably 
similar. The scales of representativeness of most interest for the 
monitoring site types described above are as follows:
    (1) Microscale--Defines the concentrations in air volumes associated 
with area dimensions ranging from several meters up to about 100 meters.
    (2) Middle scale--Defines the concentration typical of areas up to 
several city blocks in size with dimensions ranging from about 100 
meters to 0.5 kilometer.
    (3) Neighborhood scale--Defines concentrations within some extended 
area of the city that has relatively uniform land use with dimensions in 
the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometers range. The neighborhood and urban scales 
listed below have the potential to overlap in applications that concern 
secondarily formed or homogeneously distributed air pollutants.
    (4) Urban scale--Defines concentrations within an area of city-like 
dimensions, on the order of 4 to 50 kilometers. Within a city, the 
geographic placement of sources may result in there being no single site 
that can be said to represent air quality on an urban scale.
    (5) Regional scale--Defines usually a rural area of reasonably 
homogeneous geography without large sources, and extends from tens to 
hundreds of kilometers.
    (6) National and global scales--These measurement scales represent 
concentrations characterizing the nation and the globe as a whole.
    (c) Proper siting of a monitor requires specification of the 
monitoring objective, the types of sites necessary to meet the 
objective, and then the desired spatial scale of representativeness. For 
example, consider the case where the objective is to determine NAAQS 
compliance by understanding the maximum ozone concentrations for an 
area. Such areas would most likely be located downwind of a metropolitan 
area, quite likely in a suburban residential area where children and 
other susceptible individuals are likely to be outdoors. Sites located 
in these areas are most likely to represent an urban scale of 
measurement. In this example, physical location was determined by 
considering ozone precursor emission patterns, public activity, and 
meteorological characteristics affecting ozone formation and dispersion. 
Thus, spatial scale of representativeness was not used in the selection 
process but was a result of site location.
    (d) In some cases, the physical location of a site is determined 
from joint consideration of both the basic monitoring objective and the 
type of monitoring site desired, or required by this appendix. For 
example, to determine PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentrations which are typical 
over a geographic area having relatively high PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
concentrations, a neighborhood scale site is more appropriate. Such a 
site would likely be located in a residential or commercial area having 
a high overall PM<INF>2.5</INF> emission density but not in the 
immediate vicinity of any single dominant source. Note that in this 
example, the desired scale of representativeness was an important factor 
in determining the physical location of the monitoring site.
    (e) In either case, classification of the monitor by its type and 
spatial scale of representativeness is necessary and will aid in 
interpretation of the monitoring data for a particular monitoring 
objective (e.g., public reporting, NAAQS compliance, or research 
support).
    (f) Table D-1 of this appendix illustrates the relationship between 
the various site types that can be used to support the three basic 
monitoring objectives, and the scales of representativeness that are 
generally most appropriate for that type of site.

                   2. General Monitoring Requirements

    (a) The National ambient air monitoring system includes several 
types of monitoring stations, each targeting a key data collection need 
and each varying in technical sophistication.
    (b) Research grade sites are platforms for scientific studies, 
either involved with health or welfare impacts, measurement methods 
development, or other atmospheric studies. These sites may be 
collaborative efforts between regulatory agencies and researchers with 
specific scientific objectives for each. Data from these sites might be 
collected with both traditional and experimental techniques, and data 
collection might involve specific laboratory analyses not common in 
routine measurement programs. The research grade sites are not required 
by regulation; however, they are included here due to their important 
role in supporting the air quality management program.
    (c) The NCore multipollutant sites are sites that measure multiple 
pollutants in order to provide support to integrated air

[[Page 265]]

quality management data needs. NCore sites include both neighborhood and 
urban scale measurements in general, in a selection of metropolitan 
areas and a limited number of more rural locations. Continuous 
monitoring methods are to be used at the NCore sites when available for 
a pollutant to be measured, as it is important to have data collected 
over common time periods for integrated analyses. NCore multipollutant 
sites are intended to be long-term sites useful for a variety of 
applications including air quality trends analyses, model evaluation, 
and tracking metropolitan area statistics. As such, the NCore sites 
should be placed away from direct emission sources that could 
substantially impact the ability to detect area-wide concentrations. The 
Administrator must approve the NCore sites.
    (d) Monitoring sites designated as SLAMS sites, but not as NCore 
sites, are intended to address specific air quality management 
interests, and as such, are frequently single-pollutant measurement 
sites. The EPA Regional Administrator must approve the SLAMS sites.
    (e) This appendix uses the statistical-based definitions for 
metropolitan areas provided by the Office of Management and Budget and 
the Census Bureau. These areas are referred to as metropolitan 
statistical areas (MSA), micropolitan statistical areas, core-based 
statistical areas (CBSA), and combined statistical areas (CSA). A CBSA 
associated with at least one urbanized area of 50,000 population or 
greater is termed a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). A CBSA 
associated with at least one urbanized cluster of at least 10,000 
population or greater is termed a Micropolitan Statistical Area. CSA 
consist of two or more adjacent CBSA. In this appendix, the term MSA is 
used to refer to a Metropolitan Statistical Area. By definition, both 
MSA and CSA have a high degree of integration; however, many such areas 
cross State or other political boundaries. MSA and CSA may also cross 
more than one air shed. The EPA recognizes that State or local agencies 
must consider MSA/CSA boundaries and their own political boundaries and 
geographical characteristics in designing their air monitoring networks. 
The EPA recognizes that there may be situations where the EPA Regional 
Administrator and the affected State or local agencies may need to 
augment or to divide the overall MSA/CSA monitoring responsibilities and 
requirements among these various agencies to achieve an effective 
network design. Full monitoring requirements apply separately to each 
affected State or local agency in the absence of an agreement between 
the affected agencies and the EPA Regional Administrator.

                   3. Design Criteria for NCore Sites

    (a) Each State (i.e. the fifty States, District of Columbia, Puerto 
Rico, and the Virgin Islands) is required to operate at least one NCore 
site. States may delegate this requirement to a local agency. States 
with many MSAs often also have multiple air sheds with unique 
characteristics and, often, elevated air pollution. These States 
include, at a minimum, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. These States are 
required to identify one to two additional NCore sites in order to 
account for their unique situations. These additional sites shall be 
located to avoid proximity to large emission sources. Any State or local 
agency can propose additional candidate NCore sites or modifications to 
these requirements for approval by the Administrator. The NCore 
locations should be leveraged with other multipollutant air monitoring 
sites including PAMS sites, National Air Toxics Trends Stations (NATTS) 
sites, CASTNET sites, and STN sites. Site leveraging includes using the 
same monitoring platform and equipment to meet the objectives of the 
variety of programs where possible and advantageous.
    (b) The NCore sites must measure, at a minimum, PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
particle mass using continuous and integrated/filter-based samplers, 
speciated PM<INF>2.5</INF>, PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> particle mass, speciated 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, NO/
NO<INF>y</INF>, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and 
ambient temperature.
    (1) Although the measurement of NO<INF>y</INF> is required in 
support of a number of monitoring objectives, available commercial 
instruments may indicate little difference in their measurement of 
NO<INF>y</INF> compared to the conventional measurement of 
NO<INF>X</INF>, particularly in areas with relatively fresh sources of 
nitrogen emissions. Therefore, in areas with negligible expected 
difference between NO<INF>y</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> measured 
concentrations, the Administrator may allow for waivers that permit 
NO<INF>X</INF> monitoring to be substituted for the required 
NO<INF>y</INF> monitoring at applicable NCore sites.
    (2) EPA recognizes that, in some cases, the physical location of the 
NCore site may not be suitable for representative meteorological 
measurements due to the site's physical surroundings. It is also 
possible that nearby meteorological measurements may be able to fulfill 
this data need. In these cases, the requirement for meteorological 
monitoring can be waived by the Administrator.
    (c) In addition to the continuous measurements listed above, 10 of 
the NCore locations must also measure lead (Pb) either at the same sites 
or elsewhere within the MSA/CSA boundary. These ten Pb sites are 
included within the NCore networks because they are intended to be long-
term in operation, and not impacted directly from a single Pb

[[Page 266]]

source. These locations for Pb monitoring must be located in the most 
populated MSA/CSA in each of the 10 EPA Regions. Alternatively, it is 
also acceptable to use the Pb concentration data provided at urban air 
toxics sites. In approving any substitutions, the Administrator must 
consider whether these alternative sites are suitable for collecting 
long-term lead trends data for the broader area.
    (d) Siting criteria are provided for urban and rural locations. 
Sites with significant historical records that do not meet siting 
criteria may be approved as NCore by the Administrator. Sites with the 
suite of NCore measurements that are explicitly designed for other 
monitoring objectives are exempt from these siting criteria (e.g., a 
near-roadway site).
    (1) Urban NCore stations are to be generally located at urban or 
neighborhood scale to provide representative concentrations of exposure 
expected throughout the metropolitan area; however, a middle-scale site 
may be acceptable in cases where the site can represent many such 
locations throughout a metropolitan area.
    (2) Rural NCore stations are to be located to the maximum extent 
practicable at a regional or larger scale away from any large local 
emission source, so that they represent ambient concentrations over an 
extensive area.

          4. Pollutant-Specific Design Criteria for SLAMS Sites

    4.1 Ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) Design Criteria. (a) State, and where 
appropriate, local agencies must operate O<INF>3</INF> sites for various 
locations depending upon area size (in terms of population and 
geographic characteristics) and typical peak concentrations (expressed 
in percentages below, or near the O<INF>3</INF> NAAQS). Specific SLAMS 
O<INF>3</INF> site minimum requirements are included in Table D-2 of 
this appendix. The NCore sites are expected to complement the 
O<INF>3</INF> data collection that takes place at single-pollutant SLAMS 
sites, and both types of sites can be used to meet the network minimum 
requirements. The total number of O<INF>3</INF> sites needed to support 
the basic monitoring objectives of public data reporting, air quality 
mapping, compliance, and understanding O<INF>3</INF>-related atmospheric 
processes will include more sites than these minimum numbers required in 
Table D-2 of this appendix. The EPA Regional Administrator and the 
responsible State or local air monitoring agency must work together to 
design and/or maintain the most appropriate O<INF>3</INF> network to 
service the variety of data needs in an area.

\1\ Minimum monitoring requirements apply to the Metropolitan
  statistical area (MSA).
\2\ Population based on latest available census figures.
\3\ The ozone (O3) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) levels
  and forms are defined in 40 CFR part 50.
\4\ These minimum monitoring requirements apply in the absence of a
  design value.
\5\ Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) must contain an urbanized area
  of 50,000 or more population.

    (b) Within an O<INF>3</INF> network, at least one O<INF>3</INF> site 
for each MSA, or CSA if multiple MSAs are involved, must be designed to 
record the maximum concentration for that particular metropolitan area. 
More than one maximum concentration site may be necessary in some areas. 
Table D-2 of this appendix does not account for the full breadth of 
additional factors that would be considered in designing a complete 
O<INF>3</INF> monitoring program for an area. Some of these additional 
factors include geographic size, population density, complexity of 
terrain and meteorology, adjacent O<INF>3</INF> monitoring programs, air 
pollution transport from neighboring areas, and measured air quality in 
comparison to all forms of the O<INF>3</INF> NAAQS (i.e., 8-hour and 1-
hour forms). Networks must be designed to account for all of these area 
characteristics. Network designs must be re-examined in periodic network 
assessments. Deviations from the above O<INF>3</INF> requirements are 
allowed if approved by the EPA Regional Administrator.
    (c) The appropriate spatial scales for O<INF>3</INF> sites are 
neighborhood, urban, and regional. Since O<INF>3</INF> requires 
appreciable formation time, the mixing of reactants and products occurs 
over large volumes of air, and this reduces the importance of monitoring 
small scale spatial variability.
    (1) Neighborhood scale--Measurements in this category represent 
conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region, with 
dimensions of a few kilometers. Homogeneity refers to pollutant 
concentrations. Neighborhood scale data will provide valuable 
information for developing, testing, and revising concepts and models 
that describe urban/regional concentration patterns. These data will be 
useful to the understanding and definition of processes that take 
periods of hours to occur and hence involve considerable mixing and 
transport. Under stagnation conditions, a site located

[[Page 267]]

in the neighborhood scale may also experience peak concentration levels 
within a metropolitan area.
    (2) Urban scale--Measurement in this scale will be used to estimate 
concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions of 
several kilometers to 50 or more kilometers. Such measurements will be 
used for determining trends, and designing area-wide control strategies. 
The urban scale sites would also be used to measure high concentrations 
downwind of the area having the highest precursor emissions.
    (3) Regional scale--This scale of measurement will be used to typify 
concentrations over large portions of a metropolitan area and even 
larger areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. Such 
measurements will be useful for assessing the O<INF>3</INF> that is 
transported to and from a metropolitan area, as well as background 
concentrations. In some situations, particularly when considering very 
large metropolitan areas with complex source mixtures, regional scale 
sites can be the maximum concentration location.
    (d) EPA's technical guidance documents on O<INF>3</INF> monitoring 
network design should be used to evaluate the adequacy of each existing 
O<INF>3</INF> monitor, to relocate an existing site, or to locate any 
new O<INF>3</INF> sites.
    (e) For locating a neighborhood scale site to measure typical city 
concentrations, a reasonably homogeneous geographical area near the 
center of the region should be selected which is also removed from the 
influence of major NO<INF>X</INF> sources. For an urban scale site to 
measure the high concentration areas, the emission inventories should be 
used to define the extent of the area of important nonmethane 
hydrocarbons and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions. The meteorological conditions 
that occur during periods of maximum photochemical activity should be 
determined. These periods can be identified by examining the 
meteorological conditions that occur on the highest O<INF>3</INF> air 
quality days. Trajectory analyses, an evaluation of wind and emission 
patterns on high O<INF>3</INF> days, can also be useful in evaluating an 
O<INF>3</INF> monitoring network. In areas without any previous 
O<INF>3</INF> air quality measurements, meteorological and O<INF>3</INF> 
precursor emissions information would be useful.
    (f) Once the meteorological and air quality data are reviewed, the 
prospective maximum concentration monitor site should be selected in a 
direction from the city that is most likely to observe the highest 
O<INF>3</INF> concentrations, more specifically, downwind during periods 
of photochemical activity. In many cases, these maximum concentration 
O<INF>3</INF> sites will be located 10 to 30 miles or more downwind from 
the urban area where maximum O<INF>3</INF> precursor emissions 
originate. The downwind direction and appropriate distance should be 
determined from historical meteorological data collected on days which 
show the potential for producing high O<INF>3</INF> levels. Monitoring 
agencies are to consult with their EPA Regional Office when considering 
siting a maximum O<INF>3</INF> concentration site.
    (g) In locating a neighborhood scale site which is to measure high 
concentrations, the same procedures used for the urban scale are 
followed except that the site should be located closer to the areas 
bordering on the center city or slightly further downwind in an area of 
high density population.
    (h) For regional scale background monitoring sites, similar 
meteorological analysis as for the maximum concentration sites may also 
inform the decisions for locating regional scale sites. Regional scale 
sites may be located to provide data on O<INF>3</INF> transport between 
cities, as background sites, or for other data collection purposes. 
Consideration of both area characteristics, such as meteorology, and the 
data collection objectives, such as transport, must be jointly 
considered for a regional scale site to be useful.
    (i) Since O<INF>3</INF> levels decrease significantly in the colder 
parts of the year in many areas, O<INF>3</INF> is required to be 
monitored at SLAMS monitoring sites only during the ``ozone season'' as 
designated in the AQS files on a State-by-State basis and described 
below in Table D-3 of this appendix. Deviations from the O<INF>3</INF> 
monitoring season must be approved by the EPA Regional Administrator, 
documented within the annual monitoring network plan, and updated in 
AQS. Information on how to analyze O<INF>3</INF> data to support a 
change to the O<INF>3</INF> season in support of the 8-hour standard for 
a specific State can be found in reference 8 to this appendix.

    4.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) Design Criteria. (a) There are no minimum 
requirements for the number of CO monitoring sites. Continued operation 
of existing SLAMS CO sites using FRM or FEM is required until 
discontinuation is approved by the EPA Regional Administrator. Where 
SLAMS CO monitoring is ongoing, at least one site must be a maximum 
concentration site for that area under investigation.
    (b) Microscale and middle scale measurements are useful site 
classifications for SLAMS sites since most people have the potential for 
exposure on these scales. Carbon monoxide maxima occur primarily in 
areas near major roadways and intersections with high traffic density 
and often poor atmospheric ventilation.
    (1) Microscale--This scale applies when air quality measurements are 
to be used to represent distributions within street canyons, over 
sidewalks, and near major roadways. In the case with carbon monoxide, 
microscale measurements in one location can often be considered as 
representative of other similar locations in a city.
    (2) Middle scale--Middle scale measurements are intended to 
represent areas with dimensions from 100 meters to 0.5 kilometer. In 
certain cases, middle scale measurements may apply to areas that have a 
total length of several kilometers, such as ``line'' emission source 
areas. This type of emission sources areas would include air quality 
along a commercially developed street or shopping plaza, freeway 
corridors, parking lots and feeder streets.
    (c) After the spatial scale and type of site has been determined to 
meet the monitoring objective for each location, the technical guidance 
in reference 2 of this appendix should be used to evaluate the adequacy 
of each existing CO site and must be used to relocate an existing site 
or to locate any new sites.
    4.3 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) Design Criteria. (a) There are 
no minimum requirements for the number of NO<INF>2</INF> monitoring 
sites. Continued operation of existing SLAMS NO<INF>2</INF> sites using 
FRM or FEM is required until discontinuation is approved by the EPA 
Regional Administrator. Where SLAMS NO<INF>2</INF> monitoring is 
ongoing, at least one NO<INF>2</INF> site in the area must be located to 
measure the maximum concentration of NO<INF>2</INF>.
    (b) NO/NO<INF>y</INF> measurements are included within the NCore 
multipollutant site requirements and the PAMS program. These NO/
NO<INF>y</INF> measurements will produce conservative estimates for 
NO<INF>2</INF> that can be used to ensure tracking continued compliance 
with the NO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS. NO/NO<INF>y</INF> monitors are used at 
these sites because it is important to collect data on total reactive 
nitrogen species for understanding O<INF>3</INF> photochemistry.
    4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) Design Criteria. (a) There are 
no minimum requirements for the number of SO<INF>2</INF> monitoring 
sites. Continued operation of existing SLAMS SO<INF>2</INF> sites using 
FRM or FEM is required until discontinuation is approved by the EPA 
Regional Administrator. Where SLAMS SO<INF>2</INF> monitoring is 
ongoing, at least one of the SLAMS SO<INF>2</INF> sites must be a 
maximum concentration site for that specific area.
    (b) The appropriate spatial scales for SO<INF>2</INF> SLAMS 
monitoring are the microscale, middle, and possibly neighborhood scales. 
The multi-pollutant NCore sites can provide for metropolitan area trends 
analyses and general control strategy progress tracking. Other SLAMS 
sites are expected to provide data that are useful in specific 
compliance actions, for maintenance plan agreements, or for measuring 
near specific stationary sources of SO<INF>2</INF>.
    (1) Micro and middle scale--Some data uses associated with 
microscale and middle scale measurements for SO<INF>2</INF> include 
assessing the effects of control strategies to reduce concentrations 
(especially for the 3-hour and 24-hour averaging times) and monitoring 
air pollution episodes.
    (2) Neighborhood scale--This scale applies where there is a need to 
collect air quality data as part of an ongoing SO<INF>2</INF> stationary

[[Page 269]]

source impact investigation. Typical locations might include suburban 
areas adjacent to SO<INF>2</INF> stationary sources for example, or for 
determining background concentrations as part of these studies of 
population responses to exposure to SO<INF>2</INF>.
    (c) Technical guidance in reference 1 of this appendix should be 
used to evaluate the adequacy of each existing SO<INF>2</INF> site, to 
relocate an existing site, or to locate new sites.
    4.5 Lead (Pb) Design Criteria. (a) State, and where appropriate, 
local agencies are required to conduct Pb monitoring for all areas where 
Pb levels have been shown or are expected to be of concern over the most 
recent 2 years. As a minimum, there must be two SLAMS sites in any area 
where Pb concentrations currently exceed or have exceeded the Pb NAAQS 
in the most recent 2 years, and at least one of these two required sites 
must be a maximum concentration site. Where the Pb air quality 
violations are widespread or the emissions density, topography, or 
population locations are complex and varied, the EPA Regional 
Administrator may require more than two Pb ambient air monitoring sites.
    (b) The most important spatial scales to effectively characterize 
the emissions from point sources are the micro, middle, and neighborhood 
scales.
    (1) Microscale--This scale would typify areas in close proximity to 
lead point sources. Emissions from point sources such as primary and 
secondary lead smelters, and primary copper smelters may under 
fumigation conditions likewise result in high ground level 
concentrations at the microscale. In the latter case, the microscale 
would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending 
up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at microscale sites 
provide information for evaluating and developing ``hot-spot'' control 
measures.
    (2) Middle scale--This scale generally represents Pb air quality 
levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the 
order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may 
for example, include schools and playgrounds in center city areas which 
are close to major Pb point sources. Pb monitors in such areas are 
desirable because of the higher sensitivity of children to exposures of 
elevated Pb concentrations (reference 3 of this appendix). Emissions 
from point sources frequently impact on areas at which single sites may 
be located to measure concentrations representing middle spatial scales.
    (3) Neighborhood scale--The neighborhood scale would characterize 
air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas 
with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Sites of this scale 
would provide monitoring data in areas representing conditions where 
children live and play. Monitoring in such areas is important since this 
segment of the population is more susceptible to the effects of Pb. 
Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate Pb sources, the 
site may be very useful in representing typical air quality values for a 
larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure 
and trends analyses.
    (c) Technical guidance is found in references 4 and 5 of this 
appendix. These documents provide additional guidance on locating sites 
to meet specific urban area monitoring objectives and should be used in 
locating new sites or evaluating the adequacy of existing sites.
    4.6 Particulate Matter (PM<INF>10</INF>) Design Criteria. (a) State, 
and where applicable local, agencies must operate the minimum number of 
required PM<INF>10</INF> SLAMS sites listed in Table D-4 of this 
appendix.

\1\ Selection of urban areas and actual numbers of stations per area within the ranges shown in this table will
  be jointly determined by EPA and the State Agency.
\2\ High concentration areas are those for which ambient PM10 data show ambient concentrations exceeding the
  PM10 NAAQS by 20 percent or more.
\3\ Medium concentration areas are those for which ambient PM10 data show ambient concentrations exceeding 80
  percent of the PM10 NAAQS.
\4\ Low concentration areas are those for which ambient PM10 data show ambient concentrations less than 80
  percent of the PM10 NAAQS.
\5\ These minimum monitoring requirements apply in the absence of a design value.

    (b) Although microscale monitoring may be appropriate in some 
circumstances, the most important spatial scales to effectively 
characterize the emissions of PM<INF>10</INF> from both

[[Page 270]]

mobile and stationary sources are the middle scales and neighborhood 
scales.
    (1) Microscale--This scale would typify areas such as downtown 
street canyons, traffic corridors, and fence line stationary source 
monitoring locations where the general public could be exposed to 
maximum PM<INF>10</INF> concentrations. Microscale particulate matter 
sites should be located near inhabited buildings or locations where the 
general public can be expected to be exposed to the concentration 
measured. Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and 
secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes 
may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground 
level concentrations at the microscale. In the latter case, the 
microscale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions 
extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at microscale 
sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control 
measures.
    (2) Middle scale--Much of the short-term public exposure to coarse 
fraction particles (PM<INF>10</INF>) is on this scale and on the 
neighborhood scale. People moving through downtown areas or living near 
major roadways or stationary sources, may encounter particulate 
pollution that would be adequately characterized by measurements of this 
spatial scale. Middle scale PM<INF>10</INF> measurements can be 
appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term exposure public 
health effects. In many situations, monitoring sites that are 
representative of micro-scale or middle-scale impacts are not unique and 
are representative of many similar situations. This can occur along 
traffic corridors or other locations in a residential district. In this 
case, one location is representative of a neighborhood of small scale 
sites and is appropriate for evaluation of long-term or chronic effects. 
This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other 
areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as the parking lot 
and feeder streets associated with shopping centers, stadia, and office 
buildings. In the case of PM<INF>10</INF>, unpaved or seldomly swept 
parking lots associated with these sources could be an important source 
in addition to the vehicular emissions themselves.
    (3) Neighborhood scale--Measurements in this category represent 
conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with 
dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than 
the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter 
concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface 
characteristics. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide 
neighborhood scale data would represent not only the immediate 
neighborhood but also neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of 
the city. Neighborhood scale PM<INF>10</INF> sites provide information 
about trends and compliance with standards because they often represent 
conditions in areas where people commonly live and work for extended 
periods. Neighborhood scale data could provide valuable information for 
developing, testing, and revising models that describe the larger-scale 
concentration patterns, especially those models relying on spatially 
smoothed emission fields for inputs. The neighborhood scale measurements 
could also be used for neighborhood comparisons within or between 
cities.
    4.7 Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) Design Criteria.
    4.7.1 General Requirements. (a) State, and where applicable local, 
agencies must operate the minimum number of required PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
SLAMS sites listed in Table D-5 of this appendix. The NCore sites are 
expected to complement the PM<INF>2.5</INF> data collection that takes 
place at non-NCore SLAMS sites, and both types of sites can be used to 
meet the minimum PM<INF>2.5</INF> network requirements. Deviations from 
these PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring requirements must be approved by the 
EPA Regional Administrator.

\4\ These minimum monitoring requirements apply in the absence of a

\5\ Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) must contain an urbanized area
  of 50,000 or more population.

    (b) Specific Design Criteria for PM<INF>2.5</INF>. The required 
monitoring stations or sites must be sited to represent community-wide 
air quality. These sites can include sites collocated at PAMS. These 
monitoring stations will typically be at neighborhood or urban-scale; 
however, in certain instances where population-oriented micro-or middle-
scale PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring are determined by the Regional 
Administrator to represent many such locations throughout a metropolitan 
area, these smaller scales can be considered to represent community-wide 
air quality.
    (1) At least one monitoring station is to be sited in a population-
oriented area of expected maximum concentration.
    (2) For areas with more than one required SLAMS, a monitoring 
station is to be sited in an area of poor air quality.

[[Page 271]]

    (3) Additional technical guidance for siting PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitors is provided in references 6 and 7 of this appendix.
    (c) The most important spatial scale to effectively characterize the 
emissions of particulate matter from both mobile and stationary sources 
is the neighborhood scale for PM<INF>2.5</INF>. For purposes of 
establishing monitoring sites to represent large homogenous areas other 
than the above scales of representativeness and to characterize regional 
transport, urban or regional scale sites would also be needed. Most 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring in urban areas should be representative of a 
neighborhood scale.
    (1) Microscale--This scale would typify areas such as downtown 
street canyons and traffic corridors where the general public would be 
exposed to maximum concentrations from mobile sources. In some 
circumstances, the microscale is appropriate for particulate sites; 
community-oriented SLAMS sites measured at the microscale level should, 
however, be limited to urban sites that are representative of long-term 
human exposure and of many such microenvironments in the area. In 
general, microscale particulate matter sites should be located near 
inhabited buildings or locations where the general public can be 
expected to be exposed to the concentration measured. Emissions from 
stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, 
and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume 
conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the 
microscale. In the latter case, the microscale would represent an area 
impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 
meters. Data collected at microscale sites provide information for 
evaluating and developing hot spot control measures. Unless these sites 
are indicative of population-oriented monitoring, they may be more 
appropriately classified as SPM.
    (2) Middle scale--People moving through downtown areas, or living 
near major roadways, encounter particle concentrations that would be 
adequately characterized by this spatial scale. Thus, measurements of 
this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term 
exposure public health effects of particulate matter pollution. In many 
situations, monitoring sites that are representative of microscale or 
middle-scale impacts are not unique and are representative of many 
similar situations. This can occur along traffic corridors or other 
locations in a residential district. In this case, one location is 
representative of a number of small scale sites and is appropriate for 
evaluation of long-term or chronic effects. This scale also includes the 
characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few 
hundred meters such as the parking lot and feeder streets associated 
with shopping centers, stadia, and office buildings.
    (3) Neighborhood scale--Measurements in this category would 
represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-
region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular 
shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate 
matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface 
characteristics. Much of the PM<INF>2.5</INF> exposures are expected to 
be associated with this scale of measurement. In some cases, a location 
carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the 
immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in 
other parts of the city. PM<INF>2.5</INF> sites of this kind provide 
good information about trends and compliance with standards because they 
often represent conditions in areas where people commonly live and work 
for periods comparable to those specified in the NAAQS. In general, most 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring in urban areas should have this scale.
    (4) Urban scale--This class of measurement would be used to 
characterize the particulate matter concentration over an entire 
metropolitan or rural area ranging in size from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such 
measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air 
quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution 
control strategies. Community-oriented PM<INF>2.5</INF> sites may have 
this scale.
    (5) Regional scale--These measurements would characterize conditions 
over areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. As 
noted earlier, using representative conditions for an area implies some 
degree of homogeneity in that area. For this reason, regional scale 
measurements would be most applicable to sparsely populated areas. Data 
characteristics of this scale would provide information about larger 
scale processes of particulate matter emissions, losses and transport. 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> transport contributes to elevated particulate 
concentrations and may affect multiple urban and State entities with 
large populations such as in the eastern United States. Development of 
effective pollution control strategies requires an understanding at 
regional geographical scales of the emission sources and atmospheric 
processes that are responsible for elevated PM<INF>2.5</INF> levels and 
may also be associated with elevated O<INF>3</INF> and regional haze.
    4.7.2 Requirement for Continuous PM<INF>2.5</INF> Monitoring. State, 
or where appropriate, local agencies must operate continuous fine 
particulate analyzers equal to at least one-half (round up) the minimum 
required sites listed in Table D-5 of this appendix. At least one 
required FRM/FEM monitor in each MSA must be collocated. State and local 
air monitoring agencies must use methodologies

[[Page 272]]

and quality assurance/quality control(QA/QC) procedures approved by the 
EPA Regional Administrator for these sites.
    4.7.3 Requirement for PM<INF>2.5</INF> Background and Transport 
Sites. Each State shall install and operate at least one 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> site to monitor for regional background and at least 
one PM<INF>2.5</INF> site to monitor regional transport. These 
monitoring sites may be at community-oriented sites and this requirement 
may be satisfied by a corresponding monitor in an area having similar 
air quality in another State. State and local air monitoring agencies 
must use methodologies and QA/QC procedures approved by the EPA Regional 
Administrator for these sites. Methods used at these sites may include 
non-federal reference method samplers such as IMPROVE or continuous 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitors.
    4.7.4 PM<INF>2.5</INF> Chemical Speciation Site Requirements. Each 
State shall continue to conduct chemical speciation monitoring and 
analyses at sites designated to be part of the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
Speciation Trends Network (STN). The selection and modification of these 
STN sites must be approved by the Administrator. The PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
chemical speciation urban trends sites shall include analysis for 
elements, selected anions and cations, and carbon. Samples must be 
collected using the monitoring methods and the sampling schedules 
approved by the Administrator. Chemical speciation is encouraged at 
additional sites where the chemically resolved data would be useful in 
developing State implementation plans and supporting atmospheric or 
health effects related studies.
    4.7.5 Special Network Considerations Required When Using 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> Spatial Averaging Approaches. (a) The PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
NAAQS, specified in 40 CFR part 50, provides State and local air 
monitoring agencies with an option for spatially averaging 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> air quality data. More specifically, two or more 
community-oriented (i.e., sites in populated areas) PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitors may be averaged for comparison with the annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
NAAQS. This averaging approach is directly related to epidemiological 
studies used as the basis for the PM<INF>2.5</INF> annual NAAQS. Spatial 
averaging does not apply to comparisons with the daily PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
NAAQS.
    (b) State and local agencies must carefully consider their approach 
for PM<INF>2.5</INF> network design when they intend to spatially 
average the data for compliance purposes. These State and local air 
monitoring agencies must define the area over which they intend to 
average PM<INF>2.5</INF> air quality concentrations. This area is 
defined as a Community Monitoring Zone (CMZ), which characterizes an 
area of relatively similar annual average air quality. State and local 
agencies can define a CMZ in a number of ways, including as part or all 
of a metropolitan area. These CMZ must be defined within a State or 
local agencies network description, as required in Sec. 58.10 of this 
part and approved by the EPA Regional Administrator. When more than one 
CMZ is described within an agency's network design plan, CMZs must not 
overlap in their geographical coverage. The criteria that must be used 
for evaluating the acceptability of spatial averaging are defined in 
appendix N to 40 CFR part 50.
    4.8 Coarse Particulate Matter (PM<INF>10-2.5</INF>) Design Criteria.
    4.8.1 General Monitoring Requirements. (a) The only required 
monitors for PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> are those required at NCore Stations.
    (b) Although microscale monitoring may be appropriate in some 
circumstances, middle and neighborhood scale measurements are the most 
important station classifications for PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> to assess the 
variation in coarse particle concentrations that would be expected 
across populated areas that are in proximity to large emissions sources.
    (1) Microscale--This scale would typify relatively small areas 
immediately adjacent to: Industrial sources; locations experiencing 
ongoing construction, redevelopment, and soil disturbance; and heavily 
traveled roadways. Data collected at microscale stations would 
characterize exposure over areas of limited spatial extent and 
population exposure, and may provide information useful for evaluating 
and developing source-oriented control measures.
    (2) Middle scale--People living or working near major roadways or 
industrial districts encounter particle concentrations that would be 
adequately characterized by this spatial scale. Thus, measurements of 
this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of public health 
effects of coarse particle exposure. Monitors located in populated areas 
that are nearly adjacent to large industrial point sources of coarse 
particles provide suitable locations for assessing maximum population 
exposure levels and identifying areas of potentially poor air quality. 
Similarly, monitors located in populated areas that border dense 
networks of heavily-traveled traffic are appropriate for assessing the 
impacts of resuspended road dust. This scale also includes the 
characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few 
hundred meters such as school grounds and parks that are nearly adjacent 
to major roadways and industrial point sources, locations exhibiting 
mixed residential and commercial development, and downtown areas 
featuring office buildings, shopping centers, and stadiums.
    (3) Neighborhood scale--Measurements in this category would 
represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-
region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular 
shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate 
matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface 
characteristics. This category includes

[[Page 273]]

suburban neighborhoods dominated by residences that are somewhat distant 
from major roadways and industrial districts but still impacted by urban 
sources, and areas of diverse land use where residences are interspersed 
with commercial and industrial neighborhoods. In some cases, a location 
carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the 
immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in 
other parts of the city. The comparison of data from middle scale and 
neighborhood scale sites would provide valuable information for 
determining the variation of PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> levels across urban 
areas and assessing the spatial extent of elevated concentrations caused 
by major industrial point sources and heavily traveled roadways. 
Neighborhood scale sites would provide concentration data that are 
relevant to informing a large segment of the population of their 
exposure levels on a given day.
    4.8.2 PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> Chemical Speciation Site Requirements. 
PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> chemical speciation monitoring and analyses is 
required at NCore sites. The selection and modification of these sites 
must be approved by the Administrator. Samples must be collected using 
the monitoring methods and the sampling schedules approved by the 
Administrator.

   5. Network Design for Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations 
                                 (PAMS)

    The PAMS program provides more comprehensive data on O<INF>3</INF> 
air pollution in areas classified as serious, severe, or extreme 
nonattainment for O<INF>3</INF> than would otherwise be achieved through 
the NCore and SLAMS sites. More specifically, the PAMS program includes 
measurements for O<INF>3</INF>, oxides of nitrogen, VOC, and 
meteorology.
    5.1 PAMS Monitoring Objectives. PAMS design criteria are site 
specific. Concurrent measurements of O<INF>3</INF>, oxides of nitrogen, 
speciated VOC, CO, and meteorology are obtained at PAMS sites. Design 
criteria for the PAMS network are based on locations relative to 
O<INF>3</INF> precursor source areas and predominant wind directions 
associated with high O<INF>3</INF> events. Specific monitoring 
objectives are associated with each location. The overall design should 
enable characterization of precursor emission sources within the area, 
transport of O<INF>3</INF> and its precursors, and the photochemical 
processes related to O<INF>3</INF> nonattainment. Specific objectives 
that must be addressed include assessing ambient trends in 
O<INF>3</INF>, oxides of nitrogen, VOC species, and determining spatial 
and diurnal variability of O<INF>3</INF>, oxides of nitrogen, and VOC 
species. Specific monitoring objectives associated with each of these 
sites may result in four distinct site types. Detailed guidance for the 
locating of these sites may be found in reference 9 of this appendix.
    (a) Type 1 sites are established to characterize upwind background 
and transported O<INF>3</INF> and its precursor concentrations entering 
the area and will identify those areas which are subjected to transport.
    (b) Type 2 sites are established to monitor the magnitude and type 
of precursor emissions in the area where maximum precursor emissions are 
expected to impact and are suited for the monitoring of urban air toxic 
pollutants.
    (c) Type 3 sites are intended to monitor maximum O<INF>3</INF> 
concentrations occurring downwind from the area of maximum precursor 
emissions.
    (d) Type 4 sites are established to characterize the downwind 
transported O<INF>3</INF> and its precursor concentrations exiting the 
area and will identify those areas which are potentially contributing to 
overwhelming transport in other areas.
    5.2 Monitoring Period. PAMS precursor monitoring must be conducted 
annually throughout the months of June, July and August (as a minimum) 
when peak O<INF>3</INF> values are expected in each area. Alternate 
precursor monitoring periods may be submitted for approval to the 
Administrator as a part of the annual monitoring network plan required 
by Sec. 58.10.
    5.3 Minimum Monitoring Network Requirements. A Type 2 site is 
required for each area. Overall, only two sites are required for each 
area, providing all chemical measurements are made. For example, if a 
design includes two Type 2 sites, then a third site will be necessary to 
capture the NO<INF>y</INF> measurement. The minimum required number and 
type of monitoring sites and sampling requirements are listed in Table 
D-6 of this appendix. Any alternative plans may be put in place in lieu 
of these requirements, if approved by the Administrator.

    5.4 Transition Period. A transition period is allowed for phasing in 
the operation of newly required PAMS programs (due generally to 
reclassification of an area into serious, severe, or extreme 
nonattainment for ozone). Following the date of redesignation or 
reclassification of any existing O<INF>3</INF> nonattainment area to 
serious, severe, or extreme, or the designation of a new area and 
classification to serious, severe, or extreme O<INF>3</INF> 
nonattainment, a State is allowed 1 year to develop plans for its PAMS 
implementation strategy. Subsequently, a minimum of one Type 2 site must 
be operating by the first month of the following approved PAMS season. 
Operation of the remaining site(s) must, at a minimum, be phased in at 
the rate of one site per year during subsequent years as outlined in the 
approved PAMS network description provided by the State.

    (a) Table D-4 indicates the approximate number of permanent stations 
required in MSAs to characterize national and regional PM<INF>10</INF> 
air quality trends and geographical patterns. The number of 
PM<INF>10</INF> stations in areas where MSA populations exceed 1,000,000 
must be in the range from 2 to 10 stations, while in low population 
urban areas, no more than two stations are required. A range of 
monitoring stations is specified in Table D-4 because sources of 
pollutants and local control efforts can vary from one part of the 
country to another and therefore, some flexibility is allowed in 
selecting the actual number of stations in any one locale. Modifications 
from these PM<INF>10</INF> monitoring requirements must be approved by 
the Regional Administrator.

minimum required sites listed in Table D-5 of this appendix. At least 
one required continuous analyzer in each MSA must be collocated with one 
of the required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors, unless at least one of the 
required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors is itself a continuous FEM or ARM monitor 
in which case no collocation requirement applies. State and local air 
monitoring agencies must use methodologies and quality assurance/quality

                             1. Introduction

    (a) This appendix contains specific location criteria applicable to 
SLAMS, NCore, and PAMS ambient air quality monitoring probes, inlets, 
and optical paths after the general location has been selected based on 
the monitoring objectives and spatial scale of representation discussed 
in appendix D to this part. Adherence to these siting criteria is 
necessary to ensure the uniform collection of compatible and comparable 
air quality data.
    (b) The probe and monitoring path siting criteria discussed in this 
appendix must be followed to the maximum extent possible. It is 
recognized that there may be situations where some deviation from the 
siting criteria may be necessary. In any such case, the reasons must be 
thoroughly documented in a written request for a waiver that describes 
how and why the proposed siting deviates from the criteria. This 
documentation should help to avoid later questions about the validity of 
the resulting monitoring data. Conditions under which the EPA would 
consider an application for waiver from these siting criteria are 
discussed in section 10 of this appendix.
    (c) The pollutant-specific probe and monitoring path siting criteria 
generally apply to all spatial scales except where noted otherwise. 
Specific siting criteria that are phrased with a ``must'' are defined as 
requirements and exceptions must be approved through the waiver 
provisions. However, siting criteria that are phrased with a ``should'' 
are defined as goals to meet for consistency but are not requirements.

                  2. Horizontal and Vertical Placement

    The probe or at least 80 percent of the monitoring path must be 
located between 2 and 15 meters above ground level for all ozone, sulfur 
dioxide and nitrogen dioxide monitoring sites, and for neighborhood 
scale

[[Page 276]]

Pb, PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>10-2.5</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, and carbon 
monoxide sites. Middle scale PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> sites are required to 
have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. 
Microscale Pb, PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>10-2.5</INF> and PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above 
ground level. The inlet probes for microscale carbon monoxide monitors 
that are being used to measure concentrations near roadways must be 
3<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>\1/2\ meters above ground level. The probe or at 
least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be at least 1 meter 
vertically or horizontally away from any supporting structure, walls, 
parapets, penthouses, etc., and away from dusty or dirty areas. If the 
probe or a significant portion of the monitoring path is located near 
the side of a building, then it should be located on the windward side 
of the building relative to the prevailing wind direction during the 
season of highest concentration potential for the pollutant being 
measured.

                      3. Spacing From Minor Sources

    (a) It is important to understand the monitoring objective for a 
particular location in order to interpret this particular requirement. 
Local minor sources of a primary pollutant, such as SO<INF>2</INF>, 
lead, or particles, can cause high concentrations of that particular 
pollutant at a monitoring site. If the objective for that monitoring 
site is to investigate these local primary pollutant emissions, then the 
site is likely to be properly located nearby. This type of monitoring 
site would in all likelihood be a microscale type of monitoring site. If 
a monitoring site is to be used to determine air quality over a much 
larger area, such as a neighborhood or city, a monitoring agency should 
avoid placing a monitor probe, path, or inlet near local, minor sources. 
The plume from the local minor sources should not be allowed to 
inappropriately impact the air quality data collected at a site. 
Particulate matter sites should not be located in an unpaved area unless 
there is vegetative ground cover year round, so that the impact of wind 
blown dusts will be kept to a minimum.
    (b) Similarly, local sources of nitric oxide (NO) and ozone-reactive 
hydrocarbons can have a scavenging effect causing unrepresentatively low 
concentrations of O<INF>3</INF> in the vicinity of probes and monitoring 
paths for O<INF>3</INF>. To minimize these potential interferences, the 
probe or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be away from 
furnace or incineration flues or other minor sources of SO<INF>2</INF> 
or NO. The separation distance should take into account the heights of 
the flues, type of waste or fuel burned, and the sulfur content of the 
fuel.

                      4. Spacing From Obstructions

    (a) Buildings and other obstacles may possibly scavenge 
SO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, or NO<INF>2</INF>, and can act to 
restrict airflow for any pollutant. To avoid this interference, the 
probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must have 
unrestricted airflow and be located away from obstacles. The distance 
from the obstacle to the probe, inlet, or monitoring path must be at 
least twice the height that the obstacle protrudes above the probe, 
inlet, or monitoring path. An exception to this requirement can be made 
for measurements taken in street canyons or at source-oriented sites 
where buildings and other structures are unavoidable.
    (b) Generally, a probe or monitoring path located near or along a 
vertical wall is undesirable because air moving along the wall may be 
subject to possible removal mechanisms. A probe, inlet, or monitoring 
path must have unrestricted airflow in an arc of at least 180 degrees. 
This arc must include the predominant wind direction for the season of 
greatest pollutant concentration potential. For particle sampling, a 
minimum of 2 meters of separation from walls, parapets, and structures 
is required for rooftop site placement.
    (c) Special consideration must be given to the use of open path 
analyzers due to their inherent potential sensitivity to certain types 
of interferences, or optical obstructions. A monitoring path must be 
clear of all trees, brush, buildings, plumes, dust, or other optical 
obstructions, including potential obstructions that may move due to 
wind, human activity, growth of vegetation, etc. Temporary optical 
obstructions, such as rain, particles, fog, or snow, should be 
considered when siting an open path analyzer. Any of these temporary 
obstructions that are of sufficient density to obscure the light beam 
will affect the ability of the open path analyzer to continuously 
measure pollutant concentrations. Transient, but significant obscuration 
of especially longer measurement paths could occur as a result of 
certain meteorological conditions (e.g., heavy fog, rain, snow) and/or 
aerosol levels that are of a sufficient density to prevent the open path 
analyzer's light transmission. If certain compensating measures are not 
otherwise implemented at the onset of monitoring (e.g., shorter path 
lengths, higher light source intensity), data recovery during periods of 
greatest primary pollutant potential could be compromised. For instance, 
if heavy fog or high particulate levels are coincident with periods of 
projected NAAQS-threatening pollutant potential, the representativeness 
of the resulting data record in reflecting maximum pollutant 
concentrations may be substantially impaired despite the fact that the 
site may otherwise exhibit an acceptable, even exceedingly high overall 
valid data capture rate.

[[Page 277]]

                          5. Spacing From Trees

    (a) Trees can provide surfaces for SO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, or 
NO<INF>2</INF> adsorption or reactions, and surfaces for particle 
deposition. Trees can also act as obstructions in cases where they are 
located between the air pollutant sources or source areas and the 
monitoring site, and where the trees are of a sufficient height and leaf 
canopy density to interfere with the normal airflow around the probe, 
inlet, or monitoring path. To reduce this possible interference/
obstruction, the probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring 
path must be at least 10 meters or further from the drip line of trees.
    (b) The scavenging effect of trees is greater for O<INF>3</INF> than 
for other criteria pollutants. Monitoring agencies must take steps to 
consider the impact of trees on ozone monitoring sites and take steps to 
avoid this problem.
    (c) For microscale sites of any air pollutant, no trees or shrubs 
should be located between the probe and the source under investigation, 
such as a roadway or a stationary source.

                        6. Spacing From Roadways

    6.1 Spacing for Ozone and Oxide of Nitrogen Probes and Monitoring 
Paths. In siting an O<INF>3</INF> analyzer, it is important to minimize 
destructive interferences from sources of NO, since NO readily reacts 
with O<INF>3</INF>. In siting NO<INF>2</INF> analyzers for neighborhood 
and urban scale monitoring, it is important to minimize interferences 
from automotive sources. Table E-1 of this appendix provides the 
required minimum separation distances between a roadway and a probe or, 
where applicable, at least 90 percent of a monitoring path for various 
ranges of daily roadway traffic. A sampling site having a point analyzer 
probe located closer to a roadway than allowed by the Table E-1 
requirements should be classified as middle scale rather than 
neighborhood or urban scale, since the measurements from such a site 
would more closely represent the middle scale. If an open path analyzer 
is used at a site, the monitoring path(s) must not cross over a roadway 
with an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day or more. 
For those situations where a monitoring path crosses a roadway with 
fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day, one must consider the entire segment 
of the monitoring path in the area of potential atmospheric interference 
from automobile emissions. Therefore, this calculation must include the 
length of the monitoring path over the roadway plus any segments of the 
monitoring path that lie in the area between the roadway and the minimum 
separation distance, as determined from Table E-1 of this appendix. The 
sum of these distances must not be greater than 10 percent of the total 
monitoring path length.

  intermediate traffic counts should be interpolated from the table
  values based on the actual traffic count.

  approved as of December 18, 2006.

    6.2 Spacing for Carbon Monoxide Probes and Monitoring Paths. (a) 
Street canyon and traffic corridor sites (microscale) are intended to 
provide a measurement of the influence of the immediate source on the 
pollution exposure of the population. In order to provide some 
reasonable consistency and comparability in the air quality data from 
microscale sites, a minimum distance of 2 meters and a maximum distance 
of 10 meters from the edge of the nearest traffic lane must be 
maintained for these CO monitoring inlet probes. This should give 
consistency to the data, yet still allow flexibility of finding suitable 
locations.
    (b) Street canyon/corridor (microscale) inlet probes must be located 
at least 10 meters from an intersection and preferably at a midblock 
location. Midblock locations are preferable to intersection locations 
because intersections represent a much smaller portion of downtown space 
than do the streets between them. Pedestrian exposure is probably also 
greater in street canyon/corridors than at intersections.
    (c) In determining the minimum separation between a neighborhood 
scale monitoring site and a specific roadway, the presumption is made 
that measurements should not be substantially influenced by any one 
roadway. Computations were made to determine the separation distance, 
and Table E-2 of this appendix provides the required minimum separation 
distance between roadways and a probe or 90 percent of a monitoring 
path. Probes or monitoring paths that are located closer to roads than 
this criterion allows should not be classified as a neighborhood scale, 
since the measurements from such a site would closely represent the 
middle scale. Therefore, sites not meeting this criterion should be 
classified as middle scale.

\1\ Distance from the edge of the nearest traffic lane. The distance for
  intermediate traffic counts should be interpolated from the table
  values based on the actual traffic count.

    6.3 Spacing for Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>, 
PM<INF>10</INF>, Pb) Inlets. (a) Since emissions associated with the 
operation of motor vehicles contribute to urban area particulate matter 
ambient levels, spacing from roadway criteria are necessary for ensuring 
national consistency in PM sampler siting.
    (b) The intent is to locate localized hot-spot sites in areas of 
highest concentrations whether it be from mobile or multiple stationary 
sources. If the area is primarily affected by mobile sources and the 
maximum concentration area(s) is judged to be a traffic corridor or 
street canyon location, then the monitors should be located near 
roadways with the highest traffic volume and at separation distances 
most likely to produce the highest concentrations. For the microscale 
traffic corridor site, the location must be between 5 and 15 meters from 
the major roadway. For the microscale street canyon site the location 
must be between 2 and 10 meters from the roadway. For the middle scale 
site, a range of acceptable distances from the roadway is shown in 
figure E-1 of this appendix. This figure also includes separation 
distances between a roadway and neighborhood or larger scale sites by 
default. Any site, 2 to 15 meters high, and further back than the middle 
scale requirements will generally be neighborhood, urban or regional 
scale. For example, according to Figure E-1 of this appendix, if a PM 
sampler is primarily influenced by roadway emissions and that sampler is 
set back 10 meters from a 30,000 ADT (average daily traffic) road, the 
site should be classified as microscale, if the sampler height is 
between 2 and 7 meters. If the sampler height is between 7 and 15 
meters, the site should be classified as middle scale. If the sample is 
20 meters from the same road, it will be classified as middle scale; if 
40 meters, neighborhood scale; and if 110 meters, an urban scale.

            7. Cumulative Interferences on a Monitoring Path

    (This paragraph applies only to open path analyzers.) The cumulative 
length or portion of a monitoring path that is affected by minor 
sources, trees, or roadways must not exceed 10 percent of the total 
monitoring path length.

                    8. Maximum Monitoring Path Length

    (This paragraph applies only to open path analyzers.) The monitoring 
path length must not exceed 1 kilometer for analyzers in neighborhood, 
urban, or regional scale. For middle scale monitoring sites, the 
monitoring path length must not exceed 300 meters. In areas subject to 
frequent periods of dust, fog, rain, or snow, consideration should be 
given to a shortened monitoring path length to minimize loss of 
monitoring data due to these temporary optical obstructions. For certain 
ambient air monitoring scenarios using open path analyzers, shorter path 
lengths may be needed in order to ensure that the monitoring site meets 
the objectives and spatial scales defined in appendix D to this part. 
The Regional Administrator may require shorter path lengths, as needed 
on an individual basis, to ensure that the SLAMS sites meet the appendix 
D requirements. Likewise, the Administrator may specify the maximum path 
length used at NCore monitoring sites.

          9. Probe Material and Pollutant Sample Residence Time

    (a) For the reactive gases, SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, and 
O<INF>3</INF>, special probe material must be used for point analyzers. 
Studies <SUP>20-24</SUP> have been conducted to determine the 
suitability of materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl 
chloride, Tygon[supreg], aluminum, brass, stainless steel, copper, 
Pyrex[supreg] glass and Teflon[supreg] for use as intake sampling lines. 
Of the above materials, only Pyrex[supreg] glass and Teflon[supreg] have 
been found to be acceptable for use as intake sampling lines for all the 
reactive gaseous pollutants. Furthermore, the EPA<SUP>25</SUP> has 
specified borosilicate glass or FEP Teflon[supreg] as the only 
acceptable probe materials for delivering test atmospheres in the 
determination of reference or equivalent methods. Therefore, 
borosilicate glass, FEP Teflon[supreg] or their equivalent must be the 
only material in the sampling train (from inlet probe to the back of the 
analyzer) that can be in contact with the ambient air sample for 
existing and new SLAMs.
    (b) For volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring at PAMS, FEP 
Teflon[supreg] is unacceptable as the probe material because of VOC 
adsorption and desorption reactions on the FEP Teflon[supreg]. 
Borosilicate glass, stainless steel, or its equivalent are the 
acceptable probe materials for VOC and carbonyl sampling. Care must be 
taken to ensure that the sample residence time is kept to 20 seconds or 
less.
    (c) No matter how nonreactive the sampling probe material is 
initially, after a period of use reactive particulate matter is 
deposited on the probe walls. Therefore, the time it takes the gas to 
transfer from the probe inlet to the sampling device is also critical. 
Ozone in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NO) will show significant 
losses even in the most inert probe material when the residence time 
exceeds 20 seconds.<SUP>26</SUP> Other studies <SUP>27-28</SUP> indicate 
that a 10-second or less residence time is easily achievable. Therefore, 
sampling probes for reactive gas monitors at NCore must have a sample 
residence time less than 20 seconds.

                          10. Waiver Provisions

    Most sampling probes or monitors can be located so that they meet 
the requirements of this appendix. New sites with rare exceptions, can 
be located within the limits of this appendix. However, some existing 
sites may not meet these requirements and still produce useful data for 
some purposes. The EPA will consider a written request from the State 
agency to waive one or more siting criteria for some monitoring sites 
providing that the State can adequately demonstrate the need (purpose) 
for monitoring or establishing a monitoring site at that location.
    10.1 For establishing a new site, a waiver may be granted only if 
both of the following criteria are met:
    10.1.1 The site can be demonstrated to be as representative of the 
monitoring area as it would be if the siting criteria were being met.
    10.1.2 The monitor or probe cannot reasonably be located so as to 
meet the siting criteria because of physical constraints (e.g., 
inability to locate the required type of site the necessary distance 
from roadways or obstructions).
    10.2 However, for an existing site, a waiver may be granted if 
either of the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this appendix 
are met.
    10.3 Cost benefits, historical trends, and other factors may be used 
to add support to the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this 
appendix, however, they in themselves, will not be acceptable reasons 
for granting a waiver. Written requests for waivers must be submitted to 
the Regional Administrator.

                               11. Summary

    Table E-4 of this appendix presents a summary of the general 
requirements for probe and monitoring path siting criteria with respect 
to distances and heights. It is apparent from Table E-4 that different 
elevation distances above the ground are shown for the various 
pollutants. The discussion in this appendix for each of the pollutants 
describes

[[Page 280]]

reasons for elevating the monitor, probe, or monitoring path. The 
differences in the specified range of heights are based on the vertical 
concentration gradients. For CO, the gradients in the vertical direction 
are very large for the microscale, so a small range of heights are used. 
The upper limit of 15 meters is specified for consistency between 
pollutants and to allow the use of a single manifold or monitoring path 
for monitoring more than one pollutant.

N/A--Not applicable.
\1\ Monitoring path for open path analyzers is applicable only to middle or neighborhood scale CO monitoring and all applicable scales for monitoring
  SO2,O3, O3 precursors, and NO2.
\2\ When probe is located on a rooftop, this separation distance is in reference to walls, parapets, or penthouses located on roof.
\3\ Should be <ls-thn-eq>20 meters from the dripline of tree(s) and must be 10 meters from the dripline when the tree(s) act as an obstruction.
\4\ Distance from sampler, probe, or 90% of monitoring path to obstacle, such as a building, must be at least twice the height the obstacle protrudes
  above the sampler, probe, or monitoring path. Sites not meeting this criterion may be classified as middle scale (see text).
\5\ Must have unrestricted airflow 270 degrees around the probe or sampler; 180 degrees if the probe is on the side of a building.
\6\ The probe, sampler, or monitoring path should be away from minor sources, such as furnace or incineration flues. The separation distance is
  dependent on the height of the minor source's emission point (such as a flue), the type of fuel or waste burned, and the quality of the fuel (sulfur,
  ash, or lead content). This criterion is designed to avoid undue influences from minor sources.
\7\ For microscale CO monitoring sites, the probe must be <ls-thn-eq>10 meters from a street intersection and preferably at a midblock location.
\8\ Collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter
  apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference.

                          General Requirements

                           1. What Is the AQI?

    The AQI is a tool that simplifies reporting air quality to the 
general public. The AQI incorporates into a single index concentrations 
of 5 criteria pollutants: ozone (O<INF>3</INF>), particulate matter 
(PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), and 
nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>). The scale of the index is divided 
into general categories that are associated with health messages.

                         2. Why Report the AQI?

    The AQI offers various advantages:
    a. It is simple to create and understand.
    b. It conveys the health implications of air quality.
    c. It promotes uniform use throughout the country.

                        3. Must I Report the AQI?

    You must report the AQI daily if yours is a metropolitan statistical 
area (MSA) with a population over 350,000.

                    4. What Goes Into My AQI Report?

    i. Your AQI report must contain the following:
    a. The reporting area(s) (the MSA or subdivision of the MSA).
    b. The reporting period (the day for which the AQI is reported).
    c. The critical pollutant (the pollutant with the highest index 
value).
    d. The AQI (the highest index value).
    e. The category descriptor and index value associated with the AQI 
and, if you choose to report in a color format, the associated color. 
Use only the following descriptors and colors for the six AQI 
categories:

                         Table 1--AQI Categories

                                                          And this color
           For this AQI             Use this descriptor        \1\

  (Guideline for Public Reporting of Daily Air Quality--Air Quality
  Index (AQI)).

    f. The pollutant specific sensitive groups for any reported index 
value greater than

[[Page 283]]

100. Use the following sensitive groups for each pollutant:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When this pollutant has an index value    Report these sensitive groups
             above 100 * * *                           * * *
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ozone...................................  Children and people with
                                           asthma are the groups most at
                                           risk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
PM2.5...................................  People with respiratory or
                                           heart disease, the elderly
                                           and children are the groups
                                           most at risk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
PM10....................................  People with respiratory
                                           disease are the group most at
                                           risk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CO......................................  People with heart disease are
                                           the group most at risk.

SO2.....................................  People with asthma are the
                                           group most at risk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO2.....................................  Children and people with
                                           respiratory disease are the
                                           groups most at risk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ii. When appropriate, your AQI report may also contain the 
following:
    a. Appropriate health and cautionary statements.
    b. The name and index value for other pollutants, particularly those 
with an index value greater than 100.
    c. The index values for sub-areas of your MSA.
    d. Causes for unusual AQI values.
    e. Actual pollutant concentrations.

                  5. Is My AQI Report for My MSA Only?

    Generally, your AQI report applies to your MSA only. However, if a 
significant air quality problem exists (AQI greater than 100) in areas 
significantly impacted by your MSA but not in it (for example, 
O<INF>3</INF> concentrations are often highest downwind and outside an 
urban area), you should identify these areas and report the AQI for 
these areas as well.

              6. How Do I Get My AQI Report to the Public?

    You must furnish the daily report to the appropriate news media 
(radio, television, and newspapers). You must make the daily report 
publicly available at one or more places of public access, or by any 
other means, including a recorded phone message, a public Internet site, 
or facsimile transmission. When the AQI value is greater than 100, it is 
particularly critical that the reporting to the various news media be as 
extensive as possible. At a minimum, it should include notification to 
the media with the largest market coverages for the area in question.

                   7. How Often Must I Report the AQI?

    You must report the AQI at least 5 days per week. Exceptions to this 
requirement are in section 8 of this appendix.

        8. May I Make Exceptions to These Reporting Requirements?

    i. If the index value for a particular pollutant remains below 50 
for a season or year, then you may exclude the pollutant from your 
calculation of the AQI in section 12.
    ii. If all index values remain below 50 for a year, then you may 
report the AQI at your discretion. In subsequent years, if pollutant 
levels rise to where the AQI would be above 50, then the AQI must be 
reported as required in sections 3, 4, 6, and 7 of this appendix.

                               Calculation

           9. How Does the AQI Relate to Air Pollution Levels?

    For each pollutant, the AQI transforms ambient concentrations to a 
scale from 0 to 500. The AQI is keyed as appropriate to the national 
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for each pollutant. In most cases, 
the index value of 100 is associated with the numerical level of the 
short-term standard (i.e., averaging time of 24-hours or less) for each 
pollutant. Different approaches are taken for NO<INF>2</INF>, for which 
no short-term standard has been established, and for PM<INF>2.5</INF>, 
for which the annual standard is the principal vehicle for protecting 
against short-term concentrations. The index value of 50 is associated 
with the numerical level of the annual standard for a pollutant, if 
there is one, at one-half the level of the short-term standard for the 
pollutant, or at the level at which it is appropriate to begin to 
provide guidance on cautionary language. Higher categories of the index 
are based on increasingly serious health effects and increasing 
proportions of the population that are likely to be affected. The index 
is related to other air pollution concentrations through linear 
interpolation based on these levels. The AQI is equal to the highest of 
the numbers corresponding to each pollutant. For the purposes of 
reporting the AQI, the sub-indexes for PM<INF>10</INF> and 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> are to be considered separately. The pollutant 
responsible for the highest index value (the reported AQI) is called the 
``critical'' pollutant.

  10. Where Do I Get the Pollutant Concentrations To Calculate the AQI?

    You must use concentration data from population-oriented State/Local 
Air Monitoring Station (SLAMS) or parts of the SLAMS required under 40 
CFR 58.20 for each pollutant except PM. For PM, you need only calculate 
and report the AQI on days for which you have measured air quality data 
(e.g., particulate monitors often report values only every sixth day). 
You may use particulate measurements from monitors that are not 
reference or equivalent methods (for example, continuous PM<INF>10</INF> 
or PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitors)

[[Page 284]]

if you can relate these measurements by statistical linear regression to 
reference or equivalent method measurements.

                   11. Do I Have to Forecast the AQI?

    You should forecast the AQI to provide timely air quality 
information to the public, but this is not required. If you choose to 
forecast the AQI, then you may consider both long-term and short-term 
forecasts. You can forecast the AQI at least 24-hours in advance using 
the most accurate and reasonable procedures considering meteorology, 
topography, availability of data, and forecasting expertise. The 
document ``Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program'' (the 
Forecasting Guidance) will help you start a forecasting program. You can 
also issue short-term forecasts by predicting 8-hour ozone values from 
1-hour ozone values using methods suggested in the Reporting Guidance, 
``Guideline for Public Reporting of Daily Air Quality.''

                     12. How Do I Calculate the AQI?

    i. The AQI is the highest value calculated for each pollutant as 
follows:
    a. Identify the highest concentration among all of the monitors 
within each reporting area and truncate the pollutant concentration to 
one more than the significant digits used to express the level of the 
NAAQS for that pollutant. This is equivalent to the rounding conventions 
used in the NAAQS.
    b. Using Table 2, find the two breakpoints that contain the 
concentration.
    c. Using Equation 1, calculate the index.
    d. Round the index to the nearest integer.

                                                            Table 2--Breakpoints for the AQI

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Areas are generally required to report the AQI based on 8-hour ozone values. However, there are a small number of areas where an AQI based on 1-hour
  ozone values would be more precautionary. In these cases, in addition to calculating the 8-hour ozone index value, the 1-hour ozone index value may be
  calculated, and the maximum of the two values reported.
\2\ NO2 has no short-term NAAQS and can generate an AQI only above an AQI value of 200.
\3\ 8-hour O3 values do not define higher AQI values (>= 301). AQI values of 301 or higher are calculated with 1-hour O3 concentrations.
\4\ If a different SHL for PM2.5 is promulgated, these numbers will change accordingly.

    ii. If the concentration is equal to a breakpoint, then the index is 
equal to the corresponding index value in Table 2. However, Equation 1 
can still be used. The results will be equal. If the concentration is 
between two breakpoints, then calculate the index of that pollutant with 
Equation 1. You must also note that in some areas, the AQI based on 1-
hour O<INF>3</INF> will be more precautionary than using 8-hour values 
(see footnote 1 to Table 2). In these cases, you may use 1-hour values 
as well as 8-hour values to calculate index values and then use the 
maximum index value as the AQI for O<INF>3</INF>.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04AU99.044

Where:

I<INF>p</INF> = the index value for pollutant<INF>p</INF>
C<INF>p</INF> = the truncated concentration of pollutant<INF>p</INF>
BP<INF>Hi</INF> = the breakpoint that is greater than or equal to 
C<INF>p</INF>
BP<INF>Lo</INF> = the breakpoint that is less than or equal to 
C<INF>p</INF>
I<INF>Hi</INF> = the AQI value corresponding to BP<INF>Hi</INF>
I<INF>lo</INF> = the AQI value corresponding to BP<INF>Lo</INF>.

    iii. If the concentration is larger than the highest breakpoint in 
Table 2 then you may use the last two breakpoints in Table 2 when you 
apply Equation 1.

                                 Example

    iv. Using Table 2 and Equation 1, calculate the index value for each 
of the pollutants measured and select the one that produces

[[Page 285]]

the highest index value for the AQI. For example, if you observe a 
PM<INF>10</INF> value of 210 [micro]g/m\3\, a 1-hour O<INF>3</INF> value 
of 0.156 ppm, and an 8-hour O<INF>3</INF> value of 0.130 ppm, then do 
this:
    a. Find the breakpoints for PM<INF>10</INF> at 210 [micro]g/m\3\ as 
155 [micro]g/m\3\ and 254 [micro]g/m\3\, corresponding to index values 
101 and 150;
    b. Find the breakpoints for 1-hour O<INF>3</INF> at 0.156 ppm as 
0.125 ppm and 0.164 ppm, corresponding to index values 101 and 150;
    c. Find the breakpoints for 8-hour O<INF>3</INF> at 0.130 ppm as 
0.125 ppm and 0.374 ppm, corresponding to index values 201 and 300;
    d. Apply Equation 1 for 210 [micro]g/m\3\, PM<INF>10</INF>:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04AU99.045
    
    e. Apply Equation 1 for 0.156 ppm, 1-hour O<INF>3</INF>:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04AU99.046
    
    f. Apply Equation 1 for 0.130 ppm, 8-hour O<INF>3</INF>:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04AU99.047
    
    g. Find the maximum, 203. This is the AQI. The minimal AQI report 
would read:
    v. Today, the AQI for my city is 203 which is very unhealthy, due to 
ozone. Children and people with asthma are the groups most at risk.

                   Background and Reference Materials

             13. What Additional Information Should I Know?

    The EPA has developed a computer program to calculate the AQI for 
you. The program works with Windows 95, it prompts for inputs, and it 
displays all the pertinent information for the AQI (the index value, 
color, category, sensitive group, health effects, and cautionary 
language). The EPA has also prepared a brochure on the AQI that explains 
the index in detail (The Air Quality Index), Reporting Guidance 
(Guideline for Public Reporting of Daily Air Quality) that provides 
associated health effects and cautionary statements, and Forecasting 
Guidance (Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program) that 
explains the steps necessary to start an air pollution forecasting 
program. You can download the program and the guidance documents at 
www.epa.gov/airnow.

calculated according to the procedures in Sec. 59.104(a) of this 
subpart.
    Water hold-out coating means a coating applied to the interior 
cavity areas of doors, quarter panels and rocker panels for the purpose 
of corrosion resistance to prolonged water exposure.
    Weld-through primer means a primer that is applied to an area before

<R05>
Sec. 59.102  Standards.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 59.106 of this subpart, any coating 
resulting from the mixing instructions of a regulated entity must meet 
the VOC content limit given in table 1 of this subpart. VOC content is 
determined according to Sec. 59.104(a).
    (b) Different combinations or mixing ratios of coating components 
constitute different coatings. For example, coating components may be 
mixed one way to make a primer, and mixed another way to make a primer 
sealer. Each of these coatings must meet its corresponding VOC content 
limit in table 1 of this subpart. If the same combination and mixing 
ratio of coating components is recommended by a regulated entity for use 
in more than one category in table 1 of this subpart, then the most 
restrictive VOC content limit shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 59.103  Container labeling requirements.

    Each regulated entity subject to this subpart must clearly display 
on each automobile refinish coating or coating component container or 
package, the day, month, and year on which the product was manufactured, 
or a code indicating such date.


<R05>
Sec. 59.104  Compliance provisions.

    (a) For the purpose of determining compliance with the VOC content 
limits in Sec. 59.102(a) of this subpart, each regulated entity shall 
determine the VOC content of a coating using the procedures described in 
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, as appropriate.
    (1) Determine the VOC content in grams of VOC per liter of coating 
prepared for application according to its mixing instructions, excluding 
the volume of any water or exempt compounds. VOC content shall be 
calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11SE98.000

Where:

VOC content = grams of VOC per liter of coating;
W<INF>v</INF> = mass of total volatiles, in grams;
W<INF>w</INF> = mass of water, in grams;
W<INF>ec</INF> = mass of exempt compounds, in grams;
V = volume of coating, in liters;
V<INF>w</INF> = volume of water, in liters; and
V<INF>ec</INF> = volume of exempt compounds, in liters.

    (2) The VOC content of a multi-stage topcoat shall be calculated 
using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN23NO98.000

Where:

VOC<INF>multi</INF> = VOC content of a multi-stage topcoat, in grams of 
VOC per liter of coating;
VOC<INF>bc</INF> = VOC content of the basecoat, as determined in 
paragraph (a)(1) or (f) of this section;
VOC<INF>mci</INF> = VOC content of midcoat i, as determined in paragraph 
(a)(1) or (f) of this section;
VOC<INF>cc</INF> = VOC content of the clearcoat, as determined in 
paragraph (a)(1) or (f) of this section; and
M = Number of midcoats.

    (b) To determine the composition of a coating in order to perform 
the calculations in paragraph (a) of this section, the reference method 
for VOC content is Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, except as 
provided in paragraph (f) of this section. To determine the VOC content 
of a coating, the regulated entity may use Method 24 of

[[Page 290]]

appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, an alternative method as provided in 
paragraph (f) of this section, or any other reasonable means for 
predicting that the coating has been formulated as intended (e.g., 
quality assurance checks, recordkeeping). However, if there are any 
inconsistencies between the results of a Method 24 test and any other 
means for determining VOC content, the Method 24 test results will 
govern. The Administrator may require the regulated to conduct a Method 
24 analysis.
    (c) If a regulated entity recommends that its coating component(s) 
be combined with coating components of another regulated entity, and if 
the coating resulting from such a combination does not comply with the 
VOC content limit in Sec. 59.102 (a) of this subpart, then the former 
regulated entity is out of compliance, unless the entity submits Method 
24 data to the Administrator demonstrating that its recommended 
combination of coating components meets the VOC content limit in Sec. 
59.102(a). If the latter regulated entity does not make the 
recommendation of such use of the coating components, then that entity 
is not out of compliance for purposes of that resulting coating.
    (d) Pretreatment wash primers: Except as provided in paragraph (f) 
of this section, the acid weight percent of pretreatment wash primers 
must be determined using the American Society for Testing and Materials 
Test Method D 1613-96 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 59.110). If 
the pigment in a pretreatment wash primer prevents the use of this test 
method for determining the acid weight percent of the coating, then the 
test method shall be used for the nonpigmented component of the coating, 
and the acid weight percent shall be calculated based on the acid 
content of the nonpigmented component and the mixing ratio of the 
nonpigmented component to the remaining components recommended by the 
regulated entity.
    (e) Low-gloss coatings: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this 
section, the gloss reading of low-gloss coatings must be determined 
using the American Society for Testing and Materials Test Method D 523-
89 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 59.110).
    (f) The Administrator may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a 
regulated entity's use of an alternative method in lieu of Method 24 for 
determining the VOC content of coatings if the alternative method is 
demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to provide results that 
are acceptable for purposes of determining compliance with this subpart.
    (g) The Administrator may determine a regulated entity's compliance 
with the provisions of this subpart based on information required by 
this subpart or any other information available to the Administrator.

if requested by any party, will hold a public hearing to determine 
whether, under what conditions, and to what extent, a variance from the 
requirements of this subpart is necessary and will be granted. If 
requested, a hearing will be held no later than 75 days after receipt of 
a variance application. Notice of the time and place of the hearing will 
be sent to the applicant by certified mail not less than 30 days prior 
to the hearing. At least 30 days prior to the hearing, the variance 
application will be made available to the public for inspection. 
Information submitted to the Administrator by a variance applicant may 
be claimed as confidential. The Administrator may consider such 
confidential information in reaching a decision on a variance 
application. Interested members of the public will be allowed a 
reasonable opportunity to testify at the hearing.
    (c) The Administrator will issue a variance if the criteria 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) are met to the satisfaction of 
the Administrator.
    (1) If complying with the provisions of this subpart would not be 
technologically or economically feasible, and
    (2) The compliance plan proposed by the applicant can reasonably be 
implemented and will achieve compliance as expeditiously as possible.
    (d) Any variance will specify dates by which the regulated entity 
will achieve increments of progress towards compliance, and will specify 
a final compliance date by which the regulated entity will achieve 
compliance with this subpart.
    (e) A variance will cease to be effective upon failure of the party 
to whom the variance was issued to comply with any term or condition of 
the variance.
    (f) Upon the application of any party, the Administrator may review 
and, for good cause, modify or revoke a variance after holding a public 
hearing in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section.

    (a) The manufacturer or importer of any consumer product subject to 
this

[[Page 299]]

subpart small ensure that the VOC content levels in table 1 of this 
subpart and HVOC content levels in table 2 of this subpart are not 
exceeded for any consumer product manufactured or imported on or after 
December 10, 1998, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, or in Sec. Sec. 59.204 or 59.206.
    (b) For consumer products for which the label, packaging, or 
accompanying literature specifically states that the product should be 
diluted prior to use, the VOC content limits specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section shall apply to the product only after the minimum 
recommended dilution has taken place. For purposes of this paragraph, 
``minimum recommended dilution'' shall not include recommendations for 
incidental use of a concentrated product to deal with limited special 
applications such as hard-to-remove soils or stains.
    (c) For those consumer products that are registered under the 
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. section 
136-136y) (FIFRA), the compliance date of the VOC standards specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section is December 10, 1999.
    (d) The provisions specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of 
this section apply to charcoal lighter materials.
    (1) No person shall manufacture or import any charcoal lighter 
material after December 10, 1998 that emits, on average, greater than 9 
grams of VOC per start, as determined by the procedures specified in 
Sec. 59.208.
    (2) The regulated entity for a charcoal lighter material shall label 
the product with usage directions that specify the quantity of charcoal 
lighter material per pound of charcoal that was used in the testing 
protocol specified in Sec. 59.208 for that product unless the 
provisions in either paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (e)(2)(ii) of this section 
apply.
    (i) The charcoal lighter material is intended to be used in fixed 
amounts independent of the amount of charcoal used, such as paraffin 
cubes; or
    (ii) The charcoal lighter material is already incorporated into the 
charcoal, such as certain ``bag light,'' ``instant light,'' or ``match 
light'' products.
    (3) Records of emission testing results for all charcoal lighter 
materials must be made available upon request to the Administrator for 
enforcement purposes within 30 days of receipt of such requests.
    (4) If a manufacturer or importer has submitted records of emission 
testing of a charcoal lighter material to a State or local regulatory 
agency, such existing records may be submitted under paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section in lieu of new test data, provided the product formulation 
is unchanged from that which was previously tested. Such previous 
testing must have been conducted in accordance with the test protocol 
described in Sec. 59.208 or a test protocol that is approved by the 
Administrator as an alternate.
    (e) Fragrances incorporated into a consumer product up to a combined 
level of 2 weight-percent shall not be included in the weight-percent 
VOC calculation.

20 degrees Celsius; or
    (2) Consists of more than 12 carbon atoms, if the vapor pressure is 
unknown; or
    (3) Has a melting point higher than 20 degrees Celsius and does not 
sublime (i.e., does not change directly from a solid into a gas without 
melting), if the vapor pressure is unknown.
    (g) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this Section shall not 
apply to those VOC in antiperspirants or deodorants that contain more 
than 10 carbon atoms per molecule and for which the vapor pressure is 
unknown, or that have a vapor pressure of 2 millimeters of mercury or 
less at 20 degrees Celsius.
    (h) a manufacturer or importer may use the vapor pressure 
information provided by the raw material supplier as long as the 
supplier uses a method to determine vapor pressure that is generally 
accepted by the scientific community.
    (i) For hydrocarbon solvents that are complex mixtures of many 
different compounds and that are supplied on a specification basis for 
use in a consumer product, the vapor pressure of

[[Page 300]]

the hydrocarbon blend may be used to demonstrate compliance with the VOC 
content limits of this section. Identification of the concentration and 
vapor pressure for each such component in the blend is not required for 
compliance with this subpart.

product in its current formulation.
VOC<INF>STD</INF>=The VOC standard specified in Sec. 59.203(a).
VOC<INF>NC</INF>=The VOC content of the noncomplying product in its 
current formulation.

    (b) If a regulated entity demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the equation in paragraph (a)(2) of the this section 
yields inaccurate results due to some characteristic of the product 
formulation or other factors, an alternate method that accurately 
calculates emissions may be used upon approval of the Administrator.
    (c) A regulated entity shall notify the Administrator in writing of 
its intent to enter into the market an innovative product meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator must 
receive the written notification by the time the innovative product is 
available for sale or distribution to consumers. Notification shall 
include the information specified in paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this 
section.

decision, and additional supporting documentation may be submitted by 
the applicant before a decision has been reached. The Administrator will 
notify the applicant of the decision in writing and specify such terms 
and conditions that are necessary to insure that emissions from the 
product will meet the emissions reductions specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, and that such emissions reductions can be enforced.

[[Page 301]]

    (3) If an applicant has been granted an exemption to a State or 
local regulation for an innovative product by a State or local agency 
whose criteria for exemption meet or exceed those provided for in this 
section, the applicant may submit the factual basis for such an 
exemption as part of the documentation required under paragraph (d) of 
this section. In such case, the Administrator will make the 
determination required under this paragraph within 45 days after the 
applications is considered complete.
    (e) In granting an exemption for a product, the Administrator will 
establish conditions that are enforceable. These conditions may include 
the VOC content of the innovative product, dispensing rates, application 
rates, and any other parameters determined by the Administrator to be 
necessary. The Administrator will also specify the test methods for 
determining conformance to the conditions established, including 
criteria for reproducibility, accuracy, and sampling and laboratory 
procedures.
    (f) For any product for which an exemption has been granted pursuant 
to this section, the regulated entity to whom the exemption was granted 
shall notify the Administrator in writing within 30 days after any 
change in the product formulation or recommended product usage 
directions, and shall also notify the Administrator within 30 days after 
the regulated entity learns of any information that would alter the 
emissions estimates submitted to the Administrator in support of the 
exemption application.
    (g) If lower VOC content limits are promulgated for a product 
category through any subsequent rulemaking, all exemptions granted under 
this section for products in the product category shall no longer apply 
unless the innovative product has been demonstrated to have VOC 
emissions less than the applicable revised VOC content limits.
    (h) If the Administrator determines that a consumer product for 
which an exemption has been granted no longer meets the VOC emissions 
criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for an innovative 
product, the Administrator may modify or revoke the exemption as 
necessary to assure that the product will meet these criteria. The 
Administrator will not modify or revoke an exemption without first 
affording the applicant an opportunity for a public hearing to determine 
if the exemption should be modified or revoked.

emissions (E<INF>r</INF>), (expressed as CH<INF>2</INF>).
    (3) Equivalent means equipment that has been demonstrated to meet or 
exceed the performance, design, and operation specifications of the 
prescribed equipment. A demonstration that equipment or a test method is 
a suitable alternative requires written approval from the Administrator 
prior to compliance testing, based on an evaluation of comparative 
performance specifications and/or actual performance test data.
    (4) Ignition means the ready-to-cook condition of the charcoal 
determined by the temperature above the charcoal, the organic vapor 
concentration measured by the continuous organic emission monitor, and 
percent ash.
    (5) Ignition VOC emissions (eI)--means the grams (pounds) per start 
of total subject VOC mass emissions (expressed as CH<INF>2</INF>) 
resulting from the ignition of charcoal by the lighter material 
undergoing evaluation, including both charcoal and lighter material 
emissions.
    (6) labeled directions means those directions affixed to the 
charcoal lighter material which specify:
    (1) The amount of lighter material to use per kilogram (or pound) of 
charcoal, unless the lighter material is already impregnated or treated 
in the charcoal;
    (2) How to use or apply the lighter material; and
    (3) How and when to light the lighter material.
    (7) Percent ash means a qualitative observation of the ratio of 
visible charcoal surface area ignited (grayish/white ash) to total 
charcoal surface area times 100.
    (8) Reference VOC emissions (Eep)--means the grams (pounds) per

emissions may be released from the lighter material, either by 
evaporation or combustion, and further characterized such that by the 
end of said 25-minute period, ignition is achieved.
    (f) Test structure, equipment specifications, and reference 
materials. (1) The test structure is to be located in a building or 
fabricated total enclosure (i.e., with enclosed sides and top). The 
enclosure shall be such that there are no constant or intermittent air 
flows within it that cause fluctuations in the stack velocity and/or 
disruptions of air flow patterns within the test chamber containing the 
reference grill . (WARNING: If the stack is vented into the building 
enclosure, caution must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning and 
the reduction of oxygen.)
    (2) Test structure components. The following test structure

position.
    (xiii) Electric probe--A 600-watt electric probe shall be used for 
electric probe ignition tests.
    (xiv) Untreated charcoal--The laboratory conducting the testing 
shall purchase ``off the shelf'' untreated charcoal from a retail 
outlet. Charcoal shall not be provided by the manufacturer of the

    (g) Sampling and analytical methods. (1) Gas volumetric flow rate. 
Conduct a full velocity traverse using the stack velocity measurement 
device as shown in figure 3 of this Appendix A to this Subpart, or use 
Method 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Continuously record a velocity 
reference point reading during each test run using a chart recorder or 
once every 20 seconds if using Method 1A. Calculate the volumetric flow 
rate using the gas velocity, moisture content, and the stack cross-
sectional area. For the purposes of this protocol, the static pressure 
shall be assumed to be atmospheric, the molar density correction factor 
in the stack to be 1.0, and the moisture content to be 2 percent.
    (2) Integrated VOC sample. Collect integrated VOC gas samples at the 
sampling port in the exhaust stack using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, 
Method 25 Total Combustion Analysis (TCA) sampling apparatus consisting 
of two evacuated 9-liter tanks, each equipped with flow controllers, 
vacuum gauges, and probes, as shown in figure 4 of Appendix A of this 
Subpart. Use 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 25, SCAQMD Method 25.1 
(incorporated by reference--Sec. 59.213 of this subpart), or 
equivalent, for analysis. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and 
non-methane organic carbon are analyzed by the TCA and TCA/Flame 
Ionization Detector (FID) methods. Oxygen content is determined by gas 
chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector. Clean particulate 
filters between use by heating to 760 degrees Celsius (1400 degrees 
Fahrenheit) while using compressed air as a carrier for cleaning and 
purging.
    (3) Continuous organic emissions monitor. A continuous organic 
emissions monitor which uses a continuous FID shall be used for each 
test run to measure the real time organic concentration of the exhaust 
as methane. Record the emission monitor response in parts per million 
continuously during the sampling period using a chart recorder or at 
least once every 10 seconds. The VOC analyzer shall be operated as 
prescribed in the manufacturer's directions unless otherwise noted in 
this protocol.
    (h) Pretest procedure. (1) Charcoal lighter material--charcoal. 
Before each test run, remove charcoal from a sealed bag that has been 
stored for at least 72 hours in a humidity and temperature controlled 
room which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section and weight out 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds) of charcoal briquettes, 
to the nearest whole briquette over 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds), of uniform 
shape with no broken pieces using an analytical balance. Reseal the bag. 
Charcoal must be ignited within 10 minutes after removal from bag. A 
sealed or resealed bag of charcoal cannot be stored at the test site for 
greater than 45 minutes. It must be returned to a humidity and 
temperature controlled room from 72 hours. The lighter material must be 
purchased, stored, weighed, and handled the same as the barbecue 
charcoal.
    (i) For the reference VOC emission tests using an electric probe, 
place a single layer of charcoal, slightly larger than the area/circle 
of the electric probe heating element, onto the grate.

[[Page 306]]

Place the heating element on top of this first layer and cover the 
heating element with the remaining charcoal briquettes.
    (ii) For the ignition VOC emissions tests, arrange the briquettes on 
the barbecue grate in the manner specified by the ignition 
manufacturer's directions. If these manufacturer's directions do not 
specify a stacking arrangement for the briquettes, randomly stack the 
briquettes in a pile using the stacking ring described in paragraph 
(f)(3)(ix) of this section.
    (2) Charcoal lighter material--or impregnated charcoal. Store, 
handle, weigh, and stack barbecue charcoal that is designed to be lit 
without the packaging, the same as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. 
For those products which require both the package and charcoal be lit, 
weigh the whole package--do not remove charcoal. Weigh an empty package 
(not the same one to be used during the test). Subtract the package 
weight from the overall weight of the package and charcoal. The full 
package and empty package must be stored, handled, and weighed the same 
as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the difference (the charcoal 
weight) is between 0.7 to 1.4 kilograms (1.5 to 3.0 pounds), the test 
may proceed. The emissions measured (E) in Equation 5 of paragraph 
(k)(7) of this section must be adjusted to a 0.9 kilogram (2-pound) 
charge. Place packaged barbecue charcoal on the grate in the manner 
specified by the manufacturer's directions.
    (3) Initial meteorological and environmental criteria in paragraph 
(d) shall be complied with.
    (4) The stack velocity must be set before each day of testing at 140 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>9 meters per minute (450 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 
feet per minute) by performing a velocity traverse as specified in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The velocity will be attained by 
adjusting the axial fan speed using a rheostat.
    (5) The fireplace shall be conditioned at the start of each day 
before sampling tests by using a grill ignited by the electric probe. If 
a time period of over 60 minutes between sampling test runs occur, the 
condition step must be repeated.
    (6) Before each test run, leak check the continuous organic 
emissions monitor by blocking the flow to the probe. Allow the 
instrument to warm up for the duration specified by the manufacturer's 
directions. Select the 0 to 100 parts per million range. Check the 
battery level and hydrogen pressure. Zero with hydrocarbon-free air 
(<0.1 parts per million hydrocarbons as methane) span with 90 parts per 
million methane in ultra pure air. Zero and span another instrument 
selection range if needed for test purposes.
    (7) Before the testing program begins, establish a point of average 
concentration of organics in the stack by using a continuous organic 
emissions monitor and a grill with charcoal ignited by the electric 
probe 40 minutes after initial release of emissions. Record the 
continuous organic emissions monitor traverse data.
    (8) Prepare the integrated VOC sampling equipment and perform the 
required leak checks. Fit the probes with nozzles housing two micron 
particulate filters. Insert the probes and nozzles into the sampling 
port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of average 
organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic 
emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(4) of this 
section. Also, position the nozzles such that they point downstream in 
the stack. Obtain the samples concurrently and continuously over the 
test run.
    (9) Insert the continuous organic emissions monitor probe into the 
sampling port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of 
average organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic 
emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(7) of this 
section.
    (i) Test procedure. The labeled directions, as defined in paragraph 
(e) of this section, shall be followed throughout the course of the 
testing. In cases where the directions are incompatible with this 
protocol, circumvent the intent of this protocol, or are unclear 
(subject to different interpretations) and inadequate, the Administrator 
must be informed in writing of the nature of the conflict, as well as 
the proposed resolution, prior to commencing testing. When the labeled 
directions for

[[Page 307]]

a charcoal lighter material do not fall within the testing guidelines of 
this protocol, the protocol may only be modified upon written approval 
of the Administrator.
    (1) Place the bottom of the barbecue grill on the floor of the 
fireplace, 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the rear wall. Ignite charcoal 
as specified by manufacturer's labeled directions.
    (2) For electric probe ignition, carefully remove probe without 
disturbing charcoal after 10 minutes of operation.
    (3) For fluid ignition, simultaneously match light fluid on charcoal 
and fluid that has fallen to the bottom of the grill.
    (4) Place the grill temperature probe 11 centimeters (4.5 inches) 
above the top of the charcoal immediately after the charcoal lighter 
material flame goes out, or before, if the lighter material does not 
flame.
    (5) Conduct at least six test runs for both the electric probe 
ignition and for the lighter material being evaluated. Alternate these 
lighter material for all 12 runs. All runs must be conducted over 3 
consecutive days or less. Alternatively, baseline emissions testing 
(using the electric probe) may be applied to other test runs provided 
the test runs occur within 4 months of the baseline testing. Integrated 
VOC sampling and continuous organic emissions monitoring begin for each 
test run when the charcoal lighter material and/or materials start to 
generate/release organics (this will be the time of pouring for lighter 
fluids and the time of ignition for most other ignition sources). 
Option: Because the manufacturer of treated or impregnated charcoal 
supplies both the lighter material and barbecue charcoal, they may apply 
the 9 grams VOC per start emission limit as an absolute value without an 
adjustment for the VOC emissions from an electric probe.
    (6) Sampling ends for each test run when all the following 
conditions are met:
    (i) The temperature 11 centimeters (4.5 inches) above the maximum 
height of the briquette pile, using the grill temperature probe 
described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, is at least 93 
degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit);
    (ii) The continuous organic emissions monitor is reading below 30 
parts per million for at least 2 minutes;
    (iii) The test sampling has continued for 25 minutes (but not more) 
and
    (iv) The charcoal surface is 70 percent covered with ash (to be 
documented with photograph on top and 60 degrees above the horizon).
    (7) During the sampling test runs, temperatures (excluding ambient) 
and continuous organic emission monitor readings shall be recorded and 
shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Humidity, wind speed, and ambient temperature readings shall be 
monitored and shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (8) Collect one blank sample for VOC and one ambient air sample 
during one run of each day per paragraph (k) of this section.
    (j) Post-run procedure. (1) Record temperatures (including ambient), 
humidity, wind speed, and continuous organic emissions monitor reading.
    (2) Record the drift using zero and span gases. Leak check and span 
the continuous organic emissions monitor as described in paragraph 
(h)(6) of this section for the next run.
    (3) Leak check and disassemble the integrated VOC sampling equipment 
as described in Method 25 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or SCAQMD Method 
25.1 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 59.213 of this subpart), or 
equivalent.
    (4) Thoroughly clean grill surfaces of all residue before conducting 
next ignition run.
    (k) Calculations. Calculations shall be carried out to at least one 
significant digit beyond that of the acquired data, and then rounded off 
after final calculation to two significant digits for each run. All 
rounding off of numbers should be in accordance with the American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 380-93, Standard Practice for 
Use of the SI International System of Units, procedures (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 59.213 of this subpart).
    (1) Calculate the average stack reference point temperature during 
sampling (t<INF>sr</INF>).
    (2) Calculate the average measured velocities (in meters per minute 
[feet per minute]): Traverse (u<INF>t</INF>), traverse

reference point (u<INF>tr</INF>), and reference point during sampling 
(u<INF>sr</INF>).
    (3) Calculate the corrected average sampling velocity 
(u<INF>s</INF>) by applying Equation 2:

    (8) Calculate the average VOC emissions for each lighter material 
tested. Identify and discard statistical outliers. Note a minimum of 
five valid results are required for a determination. This procedure for 
eliminating an outlier may only be performed once for each lighter 
material tested.
    (9) Using Equation 6, calculate the resultant VOC emissions per 
start (E<INF>r</INF>) and determine if it is less than or equal to the 9 
grams VOC per start emission limit.

    (1) With the exception of low solids stains and low solids wood 
preservatives, determine the VOC content in grams of VOC per liter of 
coating thinned to the manufacturer's maximum recommendation, excluding 
the volume of any water and exempt compounds. Calculate the VOC content 
using equation 5 as follows:

[[Page 327]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11SE98.018

Where:

VOC content = grams of VOC per liter of coating
W<INF>s</INF> = weight of volatiles, in grams

Where:

VOC content <INF>1s</INF> = the VOC content of a low solids coating in 
grams of VOC per liter of coating
W<INF>s</INF> = weight of volatiles, in grams
W<INF>w</INF> = weight of water, in grams
W<INF>ec</INF> = weight of exempt compounds, in grams
V<INF>m</INF> = volume of coating, in liters

    (3) For recycled coatings, the manufacturer or importer has the 
option of calculating an adjusted VOC content to account for the post-
consumer coating content. If this option is used, the manufacturer or 
importer shall determine the adjusted VOC content using equations 7 and 
8 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11SE98.020

Where:

Adjusted VOC content = The VOC content assigned to the recycled coating 
for purposes of complying with the VOC content limits in table 1 of this 
subpart.
Actual VOC content = The VOC content of the coating as determined using 
equation 5 in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
Percent Post-consumer Coating = The volume percent of a recycled coating 
that is post-consumer coating materials (as determined in equation 8)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11SE98.021

Where:

Percent Post-consumer Coating = The volume percent of a recycled coating 
that is post-consumer coating materials.
Volume of Post-consumer Coating = The volume, in liters, of post-
consumer coating materials used in the production of a recycled coating.
Volume of Virgin Materials = The volume, in liters, of virgin coating 
materials used in the production of a recycled coating.

    (b) To determine the composition of a coating in order to perform 
the calculations in paragraph (a) of this section, the reference method 
for VOC content is Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, except as 
provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. To determine the VOC 
content of a coating, the manufacturer or importer may use Method 24 of 
appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, an alternative method as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, formulation data, or any other reasonable 
means for predicting that the coating has been formulated as intended 
(e.g., quality assurance checks, recordkeeping). However, if there are 
any inconsistencies between the results of a Method 24 test and any 
other means for determining VOC content, the Method 24 test results will 
govern, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The 
Administrator may

[[Page 328]]

require the manufacturer or importer to conduct a Method 24 analysis.
    (c) The Administrator may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a 
manufacturer's or importer's use of an alternative method in lieu of 
Method 24 for determining the VOC content of coatings if the alternative 
method is demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to provide 
results that are acceptable for purposes of determining compliance with 
this subpart.
    (d) Analysis of methacrylate multicomponent coatings used as traffic 
marking coatings shall be conducted according to the procedures 
specified in appendix A to this subpart. Appendix A to this subpart is a 
modification of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The 
modification of Method 24 provided in appendix A to this subpart has not 
been approved for methacrylate multicomponent coatings used for other 
purposes than as traffic marking coatings or for other classes of 
multicomponent coatings.
    (e) The Administrator may determine a manufacturer's or importer's 
compliance with the provisions of this subpart based on information 
required by this subpart (including the records and reports required by 
Sec. Sec. 59.407 and 59.408 of this subpart) or any other information 
available to the Administrator.

  Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 59--Determination of Volatile Matter 
Content of Methacrylate Multicomponent Coatings Used as Traffic Marking 
                                Coatings

                     1.0 Principle and Applicability

    1.1 Applicability. This modification to Method 24 of appendix A of 
40 CFR part 60 applies to the determination of volatile matter content 
of methacrylate multicomponent coatings used as traffic marking 
coatings.

[[Page 332]]

    1.2 Principle. A known amount of methacrylate multicomponent coating 
is dispersed in a weighing dish using a stirring device before the 
volatile matter is removed by heating in an oven.

                              2.0 Procedure

    2.1 Prepare about 100 milliliters (mL) of sample by mixing the 
components in a storage container, such as a glass jar with a screw top 
or a metal can with a cap. The storage container should be just large 
enough to hold the mixture. Combine the components (by weight or volume) 
in the ratio recommended by the manufacturer. Tightly close the 
container between additions and during mixing to prevent loss of 
volatile materials. Most manufacturers' mixing instructions are by 
volume. Because of possible error caused by expansion of the liquid when 
measuring the volume, it is recommended that the components be combined 
by weight. When weight is used to combine the components and the 
manufacturer's recommended ratio is by volume, the density must be 
determined by section 3.5 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.
    2.2 Immediately after mixing, take aliquots from this 100 mL sample 
for determination of the total volatile content, water content, and 
density. To determine water content, follow section 3.4 of Method 24 of 
appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. To determine density, follow section 3.5 
of Method 24. To determine total volatile content, use the apparatus and 
reagents described in section 3.8.2 of Method 24 and the following 
procedures:
    2.2.1 Weigh and record the weight of an aluminum foil weighing dish 
and a metal paper clip. Using a syringe as specified in section 3.8.2.1 
of Method 24, weigh to 1 milligrams (mg), by difference, a sample of 
coating into the weighing dish. For methacrylate multicomponent coatings 
used for traffic marking use 3.0 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 g.
    2.2.2 Add the specimen and use the metal paper clip to disperse the 
specimen over the surface of the weighing dish. If the material forms a 
lump that cannot be dispersed, discard the specimen and prepare a new 
one. Similarly, prepare a duplicate. The sample shall stand for a 
minimum of 1 hour, but no more than 24 hours before being oven dried at 
110 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 degrees Celsius for 1 hour.
    2.2.3 Heat the aluminum foil dishes containing the dispersed 
specimens in the forced draft oven for 60 minutes at 110 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 degrees Celsius. Caution--provide adequate 
ventilation, consistent with accepted laboratory practice, to prevent 
solvent vapors from accumulating to a dangerous level.
    2.2.4 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a 
desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg. After 
weighing, break up the film of the coating using the metal paper clip. 
Weigh dish to within 1 mg. Return to forced draft oven for an additional 
60 minutes at 110 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 degrees Celsius.
    2.2.5 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a 
desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg.
    2.2.6 Run analyses in pairs (duplicate sets for each coating mixture 
until the criterion in section 4.3 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR 
part 60 is met. Calculate the weight of volatile matter for each heating 
period following Equation 24-2 of Method 24 and record the arithmetic 
average. Add the arithmetic average for the two heating periods to 
obtain the weight fraction of the volatile matter.

                      3.0 Data Validation Procedure

    3.1 Follow the procedures in Section 4 of Method 24 of appendix A to 
40 CFR part 60.
    3.2 If more than 10 percent of the sample is lost when the sample is 
being broken up in 2.2.4, the sample is invalid.

                            4.0 Calculations

    Follow the calculation procedures in Section 5 of Method 24 of 
appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.

section, you may file a request for a hearing with the Designated 
Compliance Officer as described in Sec. 59.699. In your request, you 
must specifically state your objections, and include relevant data or 
supporting analysis. The request must be signed by your authorized 
representative. If we agree that your request raises a substantial 
factual issue, we will hold the hearing according to Sec. 59.699.


<R05>
Sec. 59.605  What portable fuel containers are excluded from this subpart's 

requirements?

    This section describes exclusions that apply to certain portable 
fuel containers. The prohibitions and requirements of this subpart do 
not apply for containers excluded under this section. Exclusions under 
this section are based on inherent characteristics of the containers. 
See Sec. 59.660 for exemptions that apply based on special 
circumstances.
    (a) Containers approved as safety cans consistent with the 
requirements of 29 CFR 1926.150 through 1926.152 are excluded. Such cans 
generally have a flash-arresting screens, spring-closing lids and spout 
covers and have been approved by a nationally recognized testing 
laboratory such as Factory Mutual Engineering Corp. or Underwriters 
Laboratories, Inc., or Federal agencies such as Bureau of Mines, or U.S. 
Coast Guard.
    (b) Containers with a nominal capacity of less than 0.25 gallons or 
more than 10.0 gallons are excluded.
    (c) Containers designed and marketed solely to deliver fuel directly 
to nonroad engines during engine operation, such as containers with a 
connection for a fuel line and a reserve fuel area, are considered to be 
nonroad fuel tanks, and are thus excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 59.607  Submission of information.

    (a) You are responsible for all statements you make to us related to 
this subpart F, including information not required during certification. 
You are

[[Page 336]]

required to provide truthful and complete information. This subpart

               Emission Standards and Related Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 59.611  What evaporative emission requirements apply under this subpart?

    (a) Hydrocarbon emissions from portable fuel containers may not 
exceed 0.3 grams per gallon per day when measured with the test 
procedures in Sec. Sec. 59.650 through 59.653. This procedure measures 
diurnal venting emissions and permeation emissions.
    (b) For the purpose of this section, portable fuel containers 
include spouts, caps, gaskets, and other parts provided with the 
container.
    (c) The following general requirements also apply for all portable 
fuel containers subject to the standards of this subpart:
    (1) Prohibited controls. The following controls are prohibited:
    (i) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control 
systems so they cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public 
health, welfare, or safety while operating.
    (ii) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control 
systems with features that disable, deactivate, reduce effectiveness, or 
bypass the emission controls, either actively or passively. For example, 
you may not include a manual vent that the operator can open to bypass 
emission controls. You may ask us to allow such features if needed for 
safety reasons or if the features operate during emission tests 
described in subpart F of this part.
    (2) Leaks. You must design and manufacture your containers to be 
free of leaks. This requirement applies when your container is upright, 
partially inverted, or completely inverted.
    (3) Refueling. You are required to design your portable fuel 
containers to minimize spillage during refueling to the extent 
practical. This requires that you use good engineering judgment to avoid 
designs that will make it difficult to refuel typical vehicle and 
equipment designs without spillage.
    (d) Portable fuel containers must meet the standards and 
requirements specified in this subpart throughout the useful life of the 
container. The useful life of the container is five years beginning on 
the date of sale to the ultimate purchaser.


<R05>
Sec. 59.612  What emission-related warranty requirements apply to me?

    (a) General requirements. You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser 
that the new portable fuel container, including all parts of its 
evaporative emission-control system, is:
    (1) Designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale 
to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this subpart.
    (2) Is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep 
it from meeting these requirements.
    (b) Warranty notice and period. Your emission-related warranty must 
be valid for a minimum of one year from the date of sale to the ultimate 
purchaser.
    (c) Notice. You must provide a warranty notice with each container.


<R05>
Sec. 59.613  What operation and maintenance instructions must I give to 

buyers?

    You must provide the ultimate purchaser of the new portable fuel 
container written instructions for properly maintaining and using the 
emission-control system.


<R05>
Sec. 59.615  How must I label and identify the portable fuel containers I produce?

    This section describes how you must label your portable fuel 
containers.
    (a) At the time of manufacture, indelibly mark the month and year of 
manufacture on each container.
    (b) Mold into or affix a legible label identifying each portable 
fuel container. The label must be:

[[Page 337]]

    (1) Attached so it is not easily removable.
    (2) Secured to a part of the container that can be easily viewed 
when the can is in use, not on the bottom of the container.
    (3) Written in English.
    (c) The label must include:
    (1) The heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.
    (2) Your full corporate name, trademark and warranty contact 
information.
    (3) A standardized identifier such as EPA's standardized designation 
for the emission families, the model number, or the part number.
    (4) This statement: ``THIS CONTAINER COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA EMISSION 
REGULATIONS FOR PORTABLE FUEL CONTAINERS (40 CFR Part 59).''.
    (5) This statement: ``THE EMISSIONS WARRANTY IS VALID FOR A MINIMUM 
OF ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF PURCHASE.''.
    (d) You may add information to the emission control information 
label to identify other emission standards that the container meets or 
does not meet (such as California standards). You may also add other 
information to ensure that the portable fuel container will be properly 
maintained and used.
    (e) You may request that we approve modified labeling requirements 
in this subpart F if you show that it is necessary or appropriate. We 
will approve your request if your alternate label is consistent with the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (f) You may identify the name and trademark of another company 
instead of their own on your emission control information label, subject 
to the following provisions:
    (1) You must have a contractual agreement with the other company 
that obligates that company to take the following steps:
    (i) Meet the emission warranty requirements that apply under Sec. 
59.612. This may involve a separate agreement involving reimbursement of 
warranty-related expenses.
    (ii) Report all warranty-related information to the certificate 
holder.
    (2) In your application for certification, identify the company 
whose trademark you will use and describe the arrangements you have made 
to meet your requirements under this section.
    (3) You remain responsible for meeting all the requirements of this 
subpart.

                      Certifying Emission Families


<R05>
Sec. 59.621  Who may apply for a certificate of conformity?

    A certificate of conformity may be issued only to the manufacturer 
that completes the construction of the portable fuel container. In 
unusual circumstances, upon a petition by a manufacturer, we may allow 
another manufacturer of the container to hold the certificate of 
conformity. However, in order to hold the certificate, the manufacturer 
must demonstrate day-to-day ability to ensure that containers produced 
under the certificate will comply with the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 59.622  What are the general requirements for obtaining a certificate of 

conformity and producing portable fuel containers under it?

    (a) You must send us a separate application for a certificate of 
conformity for each emission family. A certificate of conformity for 
containers is valid from the indicated effective date until the end of 
the production period for which it is issued. We may require new 
certification prior to the end of the production period if we finds that 
containers are not meeting the standards in use during their useful 
life.
    (b) The application must be written in English and contain all the 
information required by this subpart and must not include false or 
incomplete statements or information (see Sec. Sec. 59.607 and 59.629).
    (c) We may ask you to include less information than we specify in 
this subpart, as long as you maintain all the information required by 
Sec. 59.628.
    (d) You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related 
to your application (see Sec. 59.603).
    (e) An authorized representative of your company must approve and 
sign the application.

[[Page 338]]

    (f) See Sec. 59.629 for provisions describing how we will process 
your application.
    (g) If we approve your application, we will issue a certificate that 
will allow you to produce the containers that you described in your 
application for a specified production period. Certificates do not allow 
you to produce containers that were not described in your application, 
unless we approve the additional containers under Sec. 59.624.


<R05>
Sec. 59.623  What must I include in my application?

    This section specifies the information that must be in your 
application, unless we ask you to include less information under Sec. 
59.622(c). We may require you to provide additional information to 
evaluate your application.
    (a) Describe the emission family's specifications and other basic 
parameters of the emission controls. List each distinguishable 
configuration in the emission family. Include descriptions and part 
numbers for all detachable components such as spouts and caps.
    (b) Describe and explain the method of emission control.
    (c) Describe the products you selected for testing and the reasons 
for selecting them.
    (d) Describe the test equipment and procedures that you used, 
including any special or alternate test procedures you used (see Sec. 
59.650).
    (e) List the specifications of the test fuel to show that it falls 
within the required ranges specified in Sec. 59.650.
    (f) Include the maintenance and use instructions and warranty 
information you will give to the ultimate purchaser of each new portable 
fuel container (see Sec. 59.613).
    (g) Describe your emission control information label (see Sec. 
59.615).
    (h) State that your product was tested as described in the 
application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and test 
fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this subpart.
    (i) Present emission data to show your products meet the applicable 
emission standards. Where applicable, Sec. Sec. 59.626 and 59.627 may 
allow you to submit an application in certain cases without new emission 
data.
    (j) Report all test results, including those from invalid tests or 
from any other tests, whether or not they were conducted according to 
the test procedures of Sec. Sec. 59.650 through 59.653. We may ask you 
to send other information to confirm that your tests were valid under 
the requirements of this subpart.
    (k) Unconditionally certify that all the products in the emission 
family comply with the requirements of this subpart, other referenced 
parts of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.
    (l) Include estimates of U.S.-directed production volumes.

employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States 
related to the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 59.624  How do I amend my application for certification?

    Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your 
application to include new or modified configurations, subject to the 
provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of 
conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we 
include new or modified configurations within the scope of the 
certificate, subject to the provisions of this section. You must amend 
your application if any changes occur with respect to any information 
included in your application.
    (a) You must amend your application before you take either of the 
following actions:
    (1) Add a configuration to an emission family. In this case, the 
configuration added must be consistent with other configurations in the 
emission family with respect to the criteria listed in Sec. 59.625.
    (2) Change a configuration already included in an emission family in 
a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you 
described in your application for certification. This includes 
production and

[[Page 339]]

design changes that may affect emissions any time during the portable 
fuel containers' lifetime.
    (b) To amend your application for certification, send the Designated 
Compliance Officer the following information:
    (1) Describe in detail the addition or change in the configuration 
you intend to make.
    (2) Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended 
emission family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do 
this by showing that the original emission data are still appropriate 
with respect to showing compliance of the amended family with all 
applicable requirements.
    (3) If the original emission data for the emission family are not 
appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified configuration, 
include new test data showing that the new or modified configuration 
meets the requirements of this subpart.
    (c) We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You 
must give us these within 30 days after we request them.
    (d) For emission families already covered by a certificate of 
conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of 
conformity covers your new or modified configuration. You may ask for a 
hearing if we deny your request (see Sec. 59.699).
    (e) For emission families already covered by a certificate of 
conformity and you send us a request to amend your application, you may 
sell and distribute the new or modified configuration before we make a 
decision under paragraph (d) of this section, subject to the provisions 
of this paragraph. If we determine that the affected configurations do 
not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production 
of the configurations and any containers from the new or modified 
configuration will not be considered covered by the certificate. In 
addition, we may require you to recall any affected containers that you 
have already distributed, including those sold to the ultimate 
purchasers. Choosing to produce containers under this paragraph (e) is 
deemed to be consent to recall all containers that we determine do not 
meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy 
the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide 
information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days, 
you must stop producing the new or modified containers.


<R05>
Sec. 59.625  How do I select emission families?

    (a) Divide your product line into families of portable fuel 
containers that are expected to have similar emission characteristics 
throughout the useful life.
    (b) Group containers in the same emission family if they are the 
same in all the following aspects:
    (1) Type of material (including pigments, plasticizers, UV 
inhibitors, or other additives that may affect control of emissions).
    (2) Production method.
    (3) Spout and cap design.
    (4) Gasket material and design.
    (5) Emission control strategy.
    (c) You may subdivide a group of containers that is identical under 
paragraph (b) of this section into different emission families if you 
show the expected emission characteristics are different.
    (d) You may group containers that are not identical with respect to 
the things listed in paragraph (b) of this section in the same emission 
family if you show that their emission characteristics will be similar 
throughout their useful life.


<R05>
Sec. 59.626  What emission testing must I perform for my application for a 

certificate of conformity?

    This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show 
compliance with the emission standards in Sec. 59.611.
    (a) Test your products using the procedures and equipment specified 
in Sec. Sec. 59.650 through 59.653.
    (b) Select an emission-data unit from each emission family for 
testing. You must test a production sample or a preproduction product 
that will represent actual production. Select the configuration that is 
most likely to exceed (or have emissions nearest to) the

[[Page 340]]

applicable emission standard. For example, for a family of multilayer 
portable fuel containers, test the container with the thinnest barrier 
layer. Test three identical containers.
    (c) We may measure emissions from any of your products from the 
emission family. You must supply your products to us if we choose to 
perform confirmatory testing.
    (d) You may ask to use emission data from a previous production 
period (carryover) instead of doing new tests, but only if the emission-
data from the previous production period remains the appropriate 
emission-data unit under paragraph (b) of this section. For example, you 
may not carryover emission data for your family of containers if you 
have added a thinner-walled container than was tested previously.
    (e) We may require you to test a second unit of the same or 
different configuration in addition to the unit tested under paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (f) If you use an alternate test procedure under Sec. 59.652 and 
later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are 
equivalent to the procedures specified in this subpart, we may reject 
data you generated using the alternate procedure and base our compliance 
determination on the later testing.


<R05>
Sec. 59.627  How do I demonstrate that my emission family complies with 

evaporative emission standards?

    (a) For purposes of certification, your emission family is 
considered in compliance with an evaporative emission standard in Sec. 
59.611(a) if the test results from all portable fuel containers in the 
family that have been tested show measured emissions levels that are at 
or below the applicable standard.
    (b) Your emissions family is deemed not to comply if any container 
representing that family has test results showing an official emission 
level above the standard.
    (c) Round the measured emission level to the same number of decimal 
places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to 
the emission standard.


<R05>
Sec. 59.628  What records must I keep and what reports must I send to EPA?

    (a) Organize and maintain the following records:
    (1) A copy of all applications and any other information you send 
us.
    (2) Any of the information we specify in Sec. 59.623 that you were 
not required to include in your application.
    (3) A detailed history of each emission-data unit. For each 
emission-data unit, include all of the following:
    (i) The emission-data unit's construction, including its origin and 
buildup, steps you took to ensure that it represents production 
containers, any components you built specially for it, and all the 
components you include in your application for certification.
    (ii) All your emission tests, including documentation on routine and 
standard tests, as specified in Sec. Sec. 59.650 through 59.653, and 
the date and purpose of each test.
    (iii) All tests to diagnose emission-control performance, giving the 
date and time of each and the reasons for the test.
    (iv) Any other relevant events or information.
    (4) Production figures for each emission family divided by assembly 
plant.
    (5) If you identify your portable fuel containers by lot number or 
other identification numbers, keep a record of these numbers for all the 
containers you produce under each certificate of conformity.
    (b) Keep data from routine emission tests (such as test cell 
temperatures and relative humidity readings) for one year after we issue 
the associated certificate of conformity. Keep all other information 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section for five years after we issue 
your certificate.
    (c) Store these records in any format and on any media, as long as 
you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask 
for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review 
them at any time.
    (d) Send us copies of any maintenance instructions or explanations 
if we ask for them.
    (e) Send us an annual warranty report summarizing successful 
warranty claims by emission family under

[[Page 341]]

Sec. 59.612, including the reason for the claim. You must submit the 
report by July 1 for the preceding calendar year.


<R05>
Sec. 59.629  What decisions may EPA make regarding my certificate of 

conformity?

    (a) If we determine your application is complete and shows that the 
emission family meets all the requirements of this subpart and the Act, 
we will issue a certificate of conformity for your emission family for 
the specified production period. We may make the approval subject to 
additional conditions.
    (b) We may deny your application for certification if we determine 
that your emission family fails to comply with emission standards or 
other requirements of this subpart or the Act. Our decision may be based 
on a review of all information available to us. If we deny your 
application, we will explain why in writing.
    (c) In addition, we may deny your application or suspend, revoke, or 
void your certificate if you do any of the following:
    (1) Refuse to comply with any testing or reporting requirements.
    (2) Submit false or incomplete information.
    (3) Render inaccurate any test data.
    (4) Deny us from completing authorized activities (see Sec. 
59.698). This includes a failure to provide reasonable assistance.
    (5) Produce portable fuel containers for importation into the United 
States at a location where local law prohibits us from carrying out 
authorized activities.
    (6) Fail to supply requested information or amend your application 
to include all portable fuel containers being produced.
    (7) Take any action that otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act 
or this subpart.
    (d) If we deny your application or suspend, revoke, or void your 
certificate, you may ask for a hearing (see Sec. 59.699).


<R05>
Sec. 59.630  EPA testing.

    We may test any portable fuel container subject to the standards of 
this subpart.
    (a) Certification and production sample testing. Upon our request, a 
manufacturer must supply a prototype container or a reasonable number of 
production samples to us for verification testing. These samples will 
generally be tested using the full test procedure of Sec. 59.653.
    (b) In-use testing. We may test in-use containers using the test 
procedure of Sec. 59.653 without preconditioning.


<R05>
Sec. 59.650  General testing provisions.

    (a) The test procedures of this subpart are addressed to you as a 
manufacturer, but they apply equally to anyone who does testing for you.
    (b) Unless we specify otherwise, the terms ``procedures'' and ``test 
procedures'' in this subpart include all aspects of testing, including 
the equipment specifications, calibrations, calculations, and other 
protocols and procedural specifications needed to measure emissions.
    (c) The specification for gasoline to be used for testing is given 
in 40 CFR 1065.710. Use the grade of gasoline specified for general 
testing. Blend this grade of gasoline with reagent grade ethanol in a 
volumetric ratio of 90.0 percent gasoline to 10.0 percent ethanol. You 
may use ethanol that is less pure if you can demonstrate that it will 
not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable 
emission standards.
    (d) Accuracy and precision of all temperature measurements must be 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.2 [deg]C or better.
    (e) Accuracy and precision of mass balances must be sufficient to 
ensure accuracy and precision of two percent or better for emission 
measurements for products at the maximum level allowed by the standard.

Sec. 59.652  Other procedures.

    (a) Your testing. The procedures in this subpart apply for all 
testing you do to show compliance with emission standards, with certain 
exceptions listed in this section.
    (b) Our testing. These procedures generally apply for testing that 
we do to

[[Page 342]]

determine if your portable fuel containers complies with applicable 
emission standards. We may perform other testing as allowed by the Act.
    (c) Exceptions. We may allow or require you to use procedures other 
than those specified in this subpart as follows:
    (1) You may request to use special procedures if your portable fuel 
containers cannot be tested using the specified procedures. We will 
approve your request if we determine that it would produce emission 
measurements that represent in-use operation and we determine that it 
can be used to show compliance with the requirements of Sec. 59.611.
    (2) You may ask to use emission data collected using other 
procedures, such as those of the California Air Resources Board. We will 
approve this only if you show us that using these other procedures do 
not affect your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission 
standards. This generally requires emission levels to be far enough 
below the applicable emission standards so that any test differences do 
not affect your ability to state unconditionally that your containers 
will meet all applicable emission standards when tested using the 
specified test procedures.
    (3) You may request to use alternate procedures that are equivalent 
to allowed procedures, or more accurate or more precise than allowed 
procedures.
    (4) You may not use other procedures under this paragraph (c) until 
we approve your request.


<R05>
Sec. 59.653  How do I test portable fuel containers?

    You must test the portable fuel container as described in your 
application, with the applicable spout attached except as otherwise 
noted. Tighten fittings in a manner representative of how they would be 
tightened by a typical user.
    (a) Preconditioning for durability. Complete the following steps 
before an emissions test, in any order, unless we determine that 
omission of one or more of these durability steps will not affect the 
emissions from your container.
    (1) Pressure cycling. Perform a pressure test by sealing the 
container and cycling it between +13.8 and -1.7 kPa (+2.0 and -0.5 psig) 
for 10,000 cycles at a rate of 60 seconds per cycle. For this test, the 
spout may be removed and the pressure applied through the opening where 
the spout attaches. The purpose of this test is to represent 
environmental wall stresses caused by pressure changes and other factors 
(such as vibration or thermal expansion). If your container cannot be 
tested using the pressure cycles specified by this paragraph (a)(1), you 
may ask to use special test procedures under Sec. 59.652(c).
    (2) UV exposure. Perform a sunlight-exposure test by exposing the 
container to an ultraviolet light of at least 24 W/m\2\ (0.40 W-hr/m\2\/
min) on the container surface for at least 450 hours. Alternatively, the 
container may be exposed to direct natural sunlight for an equivalent 
period of time, as long as you ensure that the container is exposed to 
at least 450 daylight hours.
    (3) Slosh testing. Perform a slosh test by filling the portable fuel 
container to 40 percent of its capacity with the fuel specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section and rocking it at a rate of 15 cycles per 
minute until you reach one million total cycles. Use an angle deviation 
of +15[deg] to -15[deg] from level.
    (4) Spout actuation. Perform the following spout actuation and 
inversion steps at the end on the slosh testing, and at the end of the 
preconditioning soak.
    (i) Perform one complete actuation/inversion cycle per day for ten 
days.
    (ii) One actuation/inversion cycle consists of the following steps:
    (A) Remove and replace the spout to simulate filling the container.
    (B) Slowly invert the container and keep it inverted for at least 5 
seconds to ensure that the spout and mechanisms become saturated with 
fuel. Any fuel leaking from any part of the container will denote a leak 
and must be reported as part of certification. Once completed, place the 
container on a flat surface in the upright position.
    (C) Actuate the spout by fully opening and closing without 
dispensing fuel. The spout must return to the closed position without 
the aid of the operator (e.g., pushing or pulling the spout closed). 
Repeat for a total of 10 actuations. If at any point the spout

[[Page 343]]

fails to return to the closed position, the container fails the test.
    (D) Repeat the step contained in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this 
section (i.e., the inversion step).
    (E) Repeat the steps contained in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(C) of this 
section (i.e., ten actuations).
    (b) Preconditioning fuel soak. Complete the following steps before a 
diurnal emission test:
    (1) Fill the portable fuel container with the specified fuel to its 
nominal capacity, seal it using the spout, and allow it to soak at 28 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C for 20 weeks. Alternatively, the 
container may be soaked for 10 weeks at 43 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
[deg]C. You may count the time of the preconditioning steps in paragraph 
(a) of this section as part of the preconditioning fuel soak, as long as 
the ambient temperature remains within the specified temperature range 
and the fuel tank is at least 40 percent full; you may add or replace 
fuel as needed to conduct the specified durability procedures.
    (2) Pour the fuel out of the container and immediately refill to 50 
percent of nominal capacity. Be careful to not spill any fuel on the 
container. Wipe the outside of the container as needed to remove any 
liquid fuel that may have spilled on it.
    (3) Install the spout assembly that will be used in the production 
containers. The spout and other openings (such as vents) on the 
container must be tested in their open condition unless they close 
automatically and are unlikely to be left open by the user during 
typical storage. All manual closures such as caps must be left off the 
container and spout during testing.
    (c) Reference container. A reference container is required to 
correct for buoyancy effects that may occur during testing. Prepare the 
reference tank as follows:
    (1) Obtain a second container of the same model as the test tank. 
You may not use a container that has previously contained fuel or any 
other contents that might affect the stability of its mass.
    (2) Fill the reference container with enough dry sand (or other 
inert material) so that the mass of the reference container is 
approximately the same as the test container when filled with fuel. Use 
good engineering judgment to determine how similar the mass of the 
reference container needs to be to the mass of the test container 
considering the performance characteristics of your balance.
    (3) Ensure that the sand (or other inert material) is dry. This may 
require heating the container or applying a vacuum to it.
    (4) Seal the container.
    (d) Diurnal test run. To run the test, take the following steps for 
a portable fuel container that was preconditioned as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) Stabilize the fuel temperature within the portable fuel 
container at 22.2 [deg]C. Vent the container at this point to relieve 
any positive or negative pressure that may have developed during 
stabilization.
    (2) Weigh the sealed reference container and record the weight. 
Place the reference on the balance and tare it so that it reads zero. 
Place the sealed test container on the balance and record the difference 
between the test container and the reference container. This value is 
M<INF>initial</INF> Take this measurement within 8 hours of filling the 
test container with fuel as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) Immediately place the portable fuel container within a well 
ventilated, temperature-controlled room or enclosure. Do not spill or 
add any fuel.
    (4) Close the room or enclosure.
    (5) Follow the temperature profile in the following table for all 
portable fuel containers. Use good engineering judgment to follow this 
profile as closely as possible. You may use linearly interpolated 
temperatures or a spline fit for temperatures between the hourly 
setpoints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) At the end of the diurnal period, retare the balance using the 
reference container and weigh the portable fuel container. Record the 
difference in mass between the reference container and the test. This 
value is M<INF>final</INF>.
    (7) Subtract M<INF>final</INF> from M<INF>initial</INF> and divide 
the difference by the nominal capacity of the container (using at least 
three significant figures) to calculate the g/gallon/day emission rate 
as follows:

    Emission rate = (M<INF>initial</INF>--M<INF>final</INF>)/(nominal 
capacity)/(one day)

    (8) Round your result to the same number of decimal places as the 
emission standard.
    (9) Instead of determining emissions by weighing the container 
before and after the diurnal temperature cycle, you may place the 
container in a SHED meeting the specifications of 40 CFR 86.107-96(a)(1) 
and measure emissions directly. Immediately following the stabilization 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, purge the SHED and follow the 
temperature profile from paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Start 
measuring emissions when you start the temperature profile and stop 
measuring emissions when the temperature profile concludes.
    (e) For metal containers, you may demonstrate for certification that 
your portable fuel containers comply with the evaporative emission 
standards without performing the pre-soak or container durability cycles 
(i.e., the pressure cycling, UV exposure, and slosh testing) specified 
in this section. For other containers, you may demonstrate compliance 
without performing the durability cycles specified in this section only 
if we approve it after you have presented data clearly demonstrating 
that the cycle or cycles do not negatively impact the permeation rate of 
the materials used in the containers.

                      Special Compliance Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 59.660  Exemption from the standards.

    In certain circumstances, we may exempt portable fuel containers 
from the evaporative emission standards and requirements of Sec. 59.611 
and the prohibitions and requirements of Sec. 59.602. You do not need 
an exemption for any containers that you own but do not sell, offer for 
sale, introduce or deliver for introduction into U.S. commerce, or 
import into the United States. Submit your request for an exemption to 
the Designated Compliance Officer.
    (a) Portable fuel containers that are intended for export only and 
are in fact exported are exempt provided they are clearly labeled as 
being for export only. Keep records for five years of all portable fuel 
containers that you manufacture for export. Any introduction into U.S. 
commerce of such portable fuel containers for any purpose other than 
export is considered to be a violation of Sec. 59.602 by the 
manufacturer. You do not need to request this exemption.
    (b) You may ask us to exempt portable fuel containers that you will 
purchase, sell, or distribute for the sole purpose of testing them.

marketed solely for rapidly refueling racing applications which are 
designed to create a leak proof seal with the target tank

[[Page 345]]

or are designed to connect with a receiver installed on the target tank. 
This exemption is generally intended for containers used to rapidly 
refuel a race car during a pit stop and similar containers. In your 
request, explain how why these containers are unlikely to be used for 
nonracing applications. We may limit these exemptions to those 
applications that are allowed to use gasoline exempted under 40 CFR 
80.200(a).
    (e) EPA may impose reasonable conditions on any exemption, including 
a limit on the number of containers that are covered by an exemption.

<R05>
Sec. 59.664  What are the requirements for importing portable fuel containers 

into the United States?

    As specified in this section, we may require you to post a bond if 
you import into the United States containers that are subject to the 
standards of this subpart. See paragraph (f) of this section for the 
requirements related to importing containers that have been certified by 
someone else.
    (a) Prior to importing containers into the U.S., we may require you 
to post a bond to cover any potential compliance or enforcement actions 
under the Clean Air Act if you cannot demonstrate to us that you have 
assets of an appropriate liquidity readily available in the United 
States with a value equal to the retail value of the containers that you 
will import during the calendar year.
    (b) We may set the value of the bond up to five dollars per 
container.
    (c) You may meet the bond requirements of this section by obtaining 
a bond from a third-party surety that is cited in the U.S. Department of 
Treasury Circular 570, ``Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as 
Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring 
Companies'' (http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/c570.html#certified).
    (d) If you forfeit some or all of your bond in an enforcement 
action, you must post any appropriate bond for continuing importation 
within 90 days after you forfeit the bond amount.
    (e) You will forfeit the proceeds of the bond posted under this 
section if you need to satisfy any United States administrative final 
order or judicial judgment against you arising from your conduct in 
violation of this subpart.
    (f) This paragraph (f) applies if you import for resale containers 
that have been certified by someone else. You and the certificate holder 
are each responsible for compliance with the requirements of this 
subpart and the Clean Air Act. No bond is required under this section if 
either you or the certificate holder meet the conditions in paragraph 
(a) of this section. Otherwise, the importer must comply with the bond 
requirements of this section.

order.
    (1) If we do not have a warrant or court order, you may deny us 
entry.
    (2) If we have a warrant or court order, you must allow us to enter 
the facility and carry out the activities it describes.
    (c) We may seek a warrant or court order authorizing an inspection 
described in this section, whether or not we first tried to get your 
permission to inspect.
    (d) We may select any facility to do any of the following:
    (1) Inspect and monitor any aspect of portable fuel container 
manufacturing, assembly, storage, or other procedures, and any 
facilities where you do them.
    (2) Inspect and monitor any aspect of test procedures or test-
related activities, including test container selection, preparation, 
durability cycles, and maintenance and verification of your test 
equipment's calibration.
    (3) Inspect and copy records or documents related to assembling, 
storing, selecting, and testing a container.
    (4) Inspect and photograph any part or aspect of containers or 
components use for assembly.
    (e) You must give us reasonable help without charge during an 
inspection authorized by the Act. For example, you may need to help us 
arrange an inspection with the facility's managers, including clerical 
support, copying, and translation. You may also need to show us how the 
facility operates and answer other questions. If we ask in writing to 
see a particular employee at the inspection, you must ensure that he or 
she is present (legal counsel may accompany the employee).
    (f) If you have facilities in other countries, we expect you to 
locate them in places where local law does not keep us from inspecting 
as described in this section. We will not try to inspect if we learn 
that local law prohibits it, but we may suspend your certificate if we 
are not allowed to inspect.

request with the Designated Compliance Officer, including a description 
of your objection and any supporting data, within 30 days after we make 
a decision.
    (b) For a hearing you request under the provisions of this subpart, 
we will approve your request if we find that your request raises a 
substantial factual issue.
    (c) If we agree to hold a hearing, we will use the procedures
